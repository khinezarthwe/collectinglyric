Why do you stare me downAm I wrongShould I turn and kiss the groundAnd I never felt that wayI ain't the one and you know I don't come from such a placeAnd I didn't get those thingsThings that you can't growYou say that it's all my faultAnd I don't need to knowTell me something I don't knowAnd I'll find that I'm always looking 'round behind meYou said that it's all been said beforeNow I find that there's something I don't knowAnd I hate your attitudeI ain't scared at allCause it don't matter what you doAnd I'll turn around to see the truthYou're tearing it down, yeah, you're bringing it downAnd it's all on youAnd I didn't get those thingsThings that you can't growYou say that it's all my faultAnd I don't need to knowTell me something I don't knowAnd I find that I'm always looking round behind meYou said that it's all been said beforeNow I find that there's something I don't knowIf you break enough glass and there's no one to hearAnd your heart's full of hateCause your mind's full of fearLet it go. . . .So far away
