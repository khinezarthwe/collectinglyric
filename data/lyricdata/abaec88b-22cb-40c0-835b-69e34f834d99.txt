RosieWell I know we're both being usedDon't make no senseJust to carry on as we doYou know I'd love you if I knew you'd let me downNow go remind you of yourself nowSo we need to get awayOh we want to get awayBut we'll never get away, not nowWhen we're passing on the streetWe both look the other wayWas it just a fantasyWas it only in my mindSaid it feels so strongI don't knowDon't let your love be colder than deathDon't let no teardrops fall from your eye (x4)RosieWell I know we both seem confusedDon't make no senseJust to carry on as we doDon't let your love be colder than deathDon't let no teardrops fall from your eye (x4)When I'm walking down the sidewalkWhen I'm passing by the bus stopThen I think of your dead endWhen I'm passing by the bus stopWhen I'm walking down the sidewalkThen I think of your dead endIf her tears dropWell then sheGave herself away (x4)
