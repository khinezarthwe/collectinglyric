I wanna be a sheepI was a wolf for so long, I went up toward the moonAnd devoured the defenseless sheep like baloonsThat were tied to a railing and would anyway soonBe deflatedI met you in between my carnivorous mealsAnd your hair was so soft and your body was realAnd the layers of leaves blew away to revealA new pathwayNow I'm tryin' to hide my love away, be discreteBut you're a reason to change and end my violent streakA reason to be normal, a reason to bleed like a sheepI just wanna be a sheepI just wanna be a sheep following right along with the crowdsA ballon with my head floating up through the cloudsAnd a little white string holding me to the groundCould that be you?It could be youI just wanna be a sheepNow the clock on the wall plays a sinister gameIt treats every twelve hours exactly the sameAnd you cannot return and you can't get awayIt keeps goingAnd everything you've done you can never undoSo I knew that it's useless to try and be newBut when you keep your eye on me, steady and blueI keep trying anywaysAnd that eye watching me makes me not want to hurtI don't want to draw anymore blood on your shirtAnd I don't want to stay up and paw through the dirtI need sleepI just wanna be a sheepI just wanna be a sheep and be gentle and docile and dumbAnd o hear a voice call me and know I must comeAnd a shepherd to lead me and to forget where I'm fromCould that be you?It could be youI just wanna, I just wanna be a sheepYes, I am the one who's been killing the flockI admit it and now that you're over the shockWould you take me and keep me and turn back the clockWith your pretty little hand?I just wanna be a sheep
