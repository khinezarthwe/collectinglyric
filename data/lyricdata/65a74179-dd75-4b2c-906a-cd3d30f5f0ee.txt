A warrior down to the depths of my soulI terrorize evil that's out of controlOn land, in the air, at seaOn danger I feedMy war paint, the last thing my enemies seeTheir teeth and their ears are trophies for meOn land, in the air, at seaI'll be where the metal meets the meatGreenfaceGreenfaceLagoons deep in jungles are home for meThe desert nor mountains, they can't hide from meOn land, in the air, at seaI'll be where the metal meets the meatGreenfaceGreenface
