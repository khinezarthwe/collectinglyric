High above your atmosphereDo they all still cheer for who they think we areAnd once more past the sun againFeelings sinking in I think we've gone too farAnd why did you fly did you burnCan't you learn from my mistakesI have made them so I knowBored just one more cup of teaAll the stars and me they'll teach me how to shine'Cause life it's so much colder hereI'll absorb your fears and bury them insideAnd why did you fly did you burnCan't you learn from my mistakesI have made them so I knowYou're too close to the SunYou're too close to the SunYou're too close to the SunYou're too close to the SunYou're too close to the SunThings we found so lovelyTurn so uglyI've grown nakeder day by dayIt's quite disarming I find it alarmingWhen everybody's listeningWhy did you fly did you burnCan't you learn from what we've learntI can't see you anymoreYou're too close to the SunYou're too close to the SunYou're too close to the SunYou're too close to the SunYou're too close to the Sun
