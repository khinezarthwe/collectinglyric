Everything that's realAnd everything unrealizedAll infinityStarts falling from your eyesWe are fluid dreamsVivid memoriesAll uncertainlyLeads to eternityAll that we perceiveIn every mysteryWho are weWhat we seeI can't comprehendWho are weWhat we seeI can't comprehendIlluminating love falls from the skiesTo water the illusions in our eyesAll that we desire and all we fearAll our aspirations grow unclearWe feel endlesslyBeyond all gravityWho are weWhat we seeI can't comprehendWho are weWhat we seeI can't comprehend
