We all face the same wayStill it takes all dayI take a look to my left,Pick out the worst and the bestShe paints her lip,Greasy and thickAnother mirror stare,And she's going where?Another office affair,To kill an unborn scare?You talk dirty to a priest?It makes them human at leastBut is she running away,To start a brand new day?Or is she going home?Why's she driving alone?Is anyone going anywhere?Everyone's gotta be somewhereShe got a body in the boot,Or just bags full of food?Those are model's legs,But are they women's are they men's?She shouts down the phone,Missed a payment on the loanShe gotta be above the rest,Keeping up with the bestIs anyone going anywhere?Everyone's gotta be somewhereWaits tables for a crook?Wrote a hardback book?You teach kids how to read?Or sell your body on the street?A nurse without a job?Another uptown snob?But have I got you all wrong?One look and you were goneIs anyone going anywhere?Is anyone going anywhere?Is anyone going anywhere?Everyone's gotta be somewhere
