When the sun goes down I walk home alone and no one comes round,Some things are better left bottled inside for me no one else,We're all little time bombs ticking awayToo little breath and too much to sayEven if it feels as useless as repeating the same old dreamWhen i lie in bedWith this mess in my headKeep my pride in checkIt's only time before i find some one to rely onSometimes I hold my tongue when i really should speak until I'm done,So when you see me smiling, deep down inside I'm dying a mile away,Gotta stay mobile gotta keep hungry,You won't live long if you don't believe,Even if it feels as useless as repeating the same old dreamWhen i lie in bedPut my mind to rest,Keep my pride in checkIt's only time before you wake a sleeping lion.
