Step insideA better dream job you could never findA set of keys and bottles heaven wideFind yourself a seat and settle in for the rideRaise your glassWe're going to drink now till the summer's pastSo bring the hats out, we all need a laughAnd let the neighbors talk, then make sure you lose themWe can try for the right kind of lifeI only wish that you'd had a chance to decideHave a look around you, there's no one thereHow can you call this fair?Not to blameNo one's telling you you're not to blameThings around, they just don't feel the sameAnd I don't recognize this person that still remainsSettle downI really hope that you can settle downTake your tent and trailer out of townWe'll find a place to roam where you could escape toWe can try for the right kind of lifeI only wish that you'd had a chance to decideHave a look around you, there's no one thereHow can you call thisEverybody's waiting for the big surpriseBut nobody will notice when it does arriveSo send it onTry for the right kind of lifeI only wish that you'd had a chance to decideHave a look around you, there's no one thereHow can you call this fair?We're coming in from the coldAnd everybody's searching for someone to holdHave a look around you, there's no one thereHow can you call this fair?
