I regret leaving my soulI forgot I needed it to feelMaybe when I dieI'll just grab it real quick, I'm coming right backI regret leaving my mindI forgot I needed it to thinkAnd maybe to keep me aliveCan't believe I got so far with a head so emptyBut I still have eyesWait for me, wait for meBut I still have feetWait for me, wait for meI regret leaving at allI forgot I needed God like a big brotherMaybe when I die, yeah, when I dieI won't die escaping, I'll die returning to the foldBut I still have eyesWait for me, wait for meBut I still have feetWait for me, wait for meBut I still have faithIf I ever had faithWait for me, wait for me
