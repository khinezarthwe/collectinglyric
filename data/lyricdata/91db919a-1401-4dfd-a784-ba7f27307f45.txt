When I woke up this morning alone in my bedIn a cold room with damp sheets, and a pain in my headI saw you last night and you drove me insaneWhy must you hurt me again and againI've had enough, if I don't come back for more that's tough'Cos I can't stand it, the way you've planned itNo I can't stand it any longerSometimes I get so I tired I can't get no sleepI'm so drunk I can't stand up on my own two feetI'm feeling so hungry I don't want to eatYou make me so angry I can't even speakI'll stay at home where I can be aloneBecause I just can't stand it, the way you've planned itNo I can't stand it any longerTry not to cry as I lie in the rainFeel like walking through walls just to get back home againI saw you last night and I'll see you againMaybe you're trying to drive me insaneI've had enough, if I don't come back for more that's tough'Cos I can't take it any moreI'm going home where I can be aloneBecause I just can't stand it, no I can't stand itNo I can't stand it any longerGoodnight TerryGoodnight Rhoda
