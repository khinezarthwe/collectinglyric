Heaven's waiting for youJust close your  eyes and say goodbyeHearing your pulse go on and on and onI live my life in miseryI'd sacrifice this world to hold youNo breath left inside of meShattered glass keeps fallingSay GoodnightJust sleep tightSay GoodnightFlowers laid out for youSo many colors leave me blindSeeing your face reflect from our babies' eyesI live my life in miseryI'd sacrifice this world to hold youNo breath left inside of meShattered glass keeps fallingSay GoodnightJust sleep tightSay GoodnightSo here I am,You're inside of me!So here I am,Our world is over!So here I am,You're inside of me!So here I am,Our world is over!Here I am with you!I'm there till the end!Memories are calling!So farewell my friend!(Farewell my friend!)Here I am with you!I'm there till the end!Memories are calling!So farewell my friend!(Farewell my friend!)My Friend!My Friend!My Friend!
