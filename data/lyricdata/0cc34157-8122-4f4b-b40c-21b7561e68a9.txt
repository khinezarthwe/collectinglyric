You're taking care of your instinctsNo matter what you doYour life could be so much better now when everything is throughThe demons that refused to let you goThey leave with empty handsYou got to give it a tryDon't put an end to your lifeCause that's where you choke your last sighYou gotta rise with me!Cause you're so vulnerable... Me!No need for sympathy now...Yet so admirable... Say...Your passion for art is your well hidden cureCause that's where you have a planEscaping could be such a movement nowIn your fragile heart all so trueYou gotta rise with me!Cause you're so vulnerable... Me!No need for sympathy now...Yet so admirable... Say...You gotta rise with me!Cause you're so vulnerable... Me!No need for sympathy now...Yet so admirable... Say...You gotta rise with me!Cause you're so vulnerable... Me!No need for sympathy now...Yet so admirable... Say...You gotta rise with me!Cause you're so vulnerable... Me!No need for sympathy now...Yet so admirable... Say...You'll never ever hurt yourself again
