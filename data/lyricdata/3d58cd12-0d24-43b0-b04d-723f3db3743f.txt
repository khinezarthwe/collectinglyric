I am feeling very warm right nowPlease don't disappearI am spacing out with youYou are the most beautiful entity that I've ever dreamed ofAt night I will protect you in your dreamsI will be your angelYou worry so much about not having enough time togetherIt makes no difference to meI would be happy with just one minute in your armsLet's have an extended play togetherYou're telling me that we live too far to love each otherBut our love can stretch farther than the eye can seeSo how does this make you feel?How does it make you feel?How does it make you feel?How does it make you feel?How does it make you feel?Do you know that when you look at me, it is a salvation?I've been waiting for you so longI can drive on that road foreverI wish you could exist to live on my planetWell it's very hard for me to say these things in your presenceSo how does this make you feel?How does it make you feel?How does it make you feel?How does it make you feel?How does it make you feel?So how does this make you feel?Well, I really think you should quit smoking
