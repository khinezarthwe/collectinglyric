I can't light no more of your darknessAll my pictures seem to fade to black and whiteI'm growing tired and time stands still before meFrozen here on the ladder of my lifeToo late to save myself from fallingI took a chance and changed your way of lifeBut you misread my meaning when I met youClosed the door and left me blinded by the lightDon't let the sun go down on meAlthough I search myself, it's always someone else I seeI'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander freeBut losing everything is like the sun going down on meI can't find, oh, the right romantic lineBut see me once and see the way I feelDon't discard me, just because you think I mean you harmBut these cuts I have, oh they need love to help them healDon't let the sun go down on meAlthough I search myself, it's always someone else I seeI'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander freeBut losing everything is like the sun going down on meDon't let the sun go down on meAlthough I search myself, it's always someone else I seeI'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free, yeahBut losing everything is like the sun going down on me
