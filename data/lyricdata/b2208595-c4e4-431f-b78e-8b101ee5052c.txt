Fall down the stairsIt's been a long time sinceI got my hands on your teenage poemsIt's the only poison that I likeI'm throwing rocks at broken windowsPicking locks with footprints from the snowAnd I don't believe you live in a library(That sails the sea)Sleeping with a book-blanket out at sea(Like the girls told me)My little bird flew away from meShe made her home in a poor countryYou're breaking brancheson your way downJust some one newto throw your arms aroundThe next time I wake up, I want it to beIn a rabbit hole to the sound of you(Making coffee)With the warm, salty seaIts waves crashing over meLook what you doneYou punched a hole in the sun(Now it won't shine)Look what you doneYou punched a hole in the sun(How did you know?)Look what you've doneYou punched a hole in the sunAnd now it won't shine for anyone
