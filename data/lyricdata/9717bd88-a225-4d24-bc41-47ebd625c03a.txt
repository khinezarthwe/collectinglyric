When she's sleeping on the sofaWhen she's laying in her Sunday bestWhen she's turning over FridayI could swear I'm sleeping less and lessAnd the ocean's getting warmerAnd California's on her mindLos Angeles is tired, but we always seem to feel alrightAnd I won'tNo I won't...No I won't...Cause she's already out the doorShe's already out of hereShe's already gone away...already gone awayWhen I'm coming over SundayAnd I think about you all the timeI wonder what you're doin'I wonder why you never cry,When Boston's always rainingAnd we never ever seemed aliveI sung about you once now, I guess I might as wellBut I won't...No I won't...No I won't...Cause I'm already out the doorI'm already out of hereI'm already gone away...already gone awayWell I'm already out of the doorShe's already out of hereI've already gone awayAlready gone away
