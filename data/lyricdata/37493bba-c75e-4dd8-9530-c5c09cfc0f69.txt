I said man, can you help me out?Bring me back to loveBring me back to lifeOh why should I care?I said how, could you keep me out?Without a wish to shareSo without a doubtOh then why should I care?We have been warnedIt's a classic signIt's a wicked mindWith an axe to grindWhen is it our, our turn?So why should we care?Yeah we have been warnedIt's a classic signWhy should we care?If this is our last summerOh then why should we care?If this could be our last summerThen why should we care?
