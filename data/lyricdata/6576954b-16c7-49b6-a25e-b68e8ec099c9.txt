The photos on my wallThe glow of the off switchIt's so good to hear your voiceAs a stolen guitar fallsI don't think before I speakI break you're heartJust waiting for your turn to speakEveryone's got an opinionI stair and nod my headAnd leave straight when it finishesI think I could do betterSo arrogantYou read and it makes no senseDon't understand a single word he saysMy head hurts from being on the phoneAnd my ears are ringing from the night beforeI don't think before I speakI break you're heartI think I could do betterSo arrogant
