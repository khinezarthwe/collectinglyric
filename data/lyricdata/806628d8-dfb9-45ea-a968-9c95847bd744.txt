There is something about this songThis is a song about something thereWe did the clubs what ass, I was hoping to have her in the sackI was looking handsome, she was looking like an erotic vultureI was all dressed in black, she was all dressed up in blackEverything was fine down here what you call it here, call it what you will hereWay down in this subbacultchaHer warm white belly in the life I'd lived had seen nothing finerShe shakes and she moves me or somethingShe's like jellyroll, like sculptureI was wearing eyeliner, she was wearing eyelinerIt was so good down here, saving for my scrapbook hereWay down, down, down in this subbacultchaNow we live on the sea and relax and ride the tackDrug running on this Panamanian schoonerShe walks the deck in a black dress and me, I dress up in blackAnd we listen to the sea and look at the sky in a poetic kind of wayWhat you call it when you look at the sky in a poetic kind of wayYou know when you grope for luna
