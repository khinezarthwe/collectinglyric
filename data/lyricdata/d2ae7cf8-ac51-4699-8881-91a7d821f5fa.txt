Lady of the Sunshine, surely I will live again.Lady in the heart of time, take me to the other side.Lady of the Sunshine, for you, I'd die again.Lady in the eyes of mine, take me on the wings you ride.Oh, and we'll get high...Oh, and we'll get high...Lady of the Sunshine, my time has come to an end.Lady in the heart of time, surely I will love again.Lady of the Sunshine, for you, I'd die again.Lady in the eyes of mine, take my hand and we'll get high.Oooh, ooh, ooooh.Oh, and we'll get high...Oh, and we'll get high...Oh, and we'll get higher...Lady of the Sunshine, show me how to love again.Lady of the Sunshine, for you I'd die again.
