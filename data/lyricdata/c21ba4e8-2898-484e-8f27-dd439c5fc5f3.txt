Last time that I saw youdown in the city, we were too busy to movemaking our own direction.But we'll never forget our connectionAlways stick to your roots with youWhenever you are downremember your crew.Shining so strong, beautiful starInternational travelleryou never give upyou never give upWe all know that you had to gojust spread your wingsand let the wind take your flow.It was just a matter of timebefore the whole world awoken to your shine.Now that you got itdon't throw it away.Two steps ahead of the packand that's where you should stayShining so strong beautiful starInternational travelleryou never give up(Chorus)It's good to see you again my friendIt's been a long long timeIt's good to hear your voice again friendIt's been a long long timeIt's been a long long timeIt's been a long long timeDon't you fall from gracebe cool with your spacecheck your placein the race   x3(Chorus until fade)
