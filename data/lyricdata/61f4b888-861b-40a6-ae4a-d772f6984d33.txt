The body breaksAnd the body is fineI'm open to yoursAnd i'm open to mineThe body achesAnd that ache takes it timeBut you'll get over yoursAnd i'll get over mineAnd the sun will shineAnd the moon will rise upThe body callsYeah, the body, it calls outIt whispers at firstBut it ends with a shoutThe body burnsYeah, the body burns strongUntil mine is with yoursThen mine will burn onMy flesh sings outIt sings, "come put me out"The body swaysLike the wind on a swingA bridge through a hoopOr a lake through a ringThe body staysAnd then the body moves onAnd I'd really rather not dwell onWhen yours will be goneBut within the darkThere is a shineOne tiny sparkThat's yours and mine
