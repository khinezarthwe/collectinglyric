(Altus/White)Superstition creeps withinThey alter what we hold in our perceptionOur subconscious stores the cluesTo what is in our mind and what is real(Pre-Chorus:)No one knows the reasonNo one has the keyTo unlock the door of this mysteryWill we ever find out?Will we ever see?What's behind the curtain of perplexity?(Chorus:)So many things in life we just can't explainThere is so much that's still unclearIf we dare to enter the forbidden zoneWe'd no longer feel the fear of the unknownImages of the unseenWander through our imaginationIt's all so strange, the wonder of it allOur hopes and fears, the rise and falls(Repeat Pre-Chorus & Chorus)This unseen power mystifies the hourTransforms the blue skies to redThe howling moon is callingAs the dead of night is fallingThese spirits dance upon our soulsSometimes you can feel itYou might not believe it; but things happen thatwe can't controlNothing has changedIt's still the sameUnanswered questions will remain
