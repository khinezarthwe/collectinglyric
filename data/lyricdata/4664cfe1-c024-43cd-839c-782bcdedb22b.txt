She's in love with heaven aboveWell I think she is religiousEyes of gold and lips are boldWith a look that is suspiciousLove with God his every wordIs all she ever wantedSoul is clean and so sereneHer head it is huntedI'll never find what it's worth in the universeConfused like hell just who can tellConfusion is a bad gameIt's coming down, it's coming downIt's gonna burn up your brainLove with God his every wordThey tell you on the back seatYou're serene, submit to meAnd understand what will beI'll never find what it's worth in the universeI'll never find what it's worth in the universe
