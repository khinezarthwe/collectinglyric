I'm sorry but did I never mentionI'm better off with you'Cause now I think it's time that you understoodWe're better off as twoEver since we met we've never been too clearAll our insecurities turn up in all our fearsAnd how we've tried to make our problems disappearNever searching hard enough to find all in my tearsThat's what I'm really aboutThe reason we are joined'Cause we are always trying to beStrongest in our weakest pointsI'm sorry but did I never mentionI'm better off with you'Cause now I think it's time that you understoodWe're better off as twoI know it gets too much sometimes when we're both not in tuneSinging to a different song, breaking us both in twoThen we start again, all the mistakes that we've madeNow we work in harmony with notes that never stray'Cause we are always trying to beStrongest in our weakest pointsI'm sorry but did I never mentionI'm better off with you'Cause now I think it's time that you understoodWe're better off as twoLimiting ourselves has never worked too wellBoundaries never kept but always making more but stillWe have made it far in the space of timeBeing on our own won't work so why not just be mineI'm sorry but did I never mentionI'm better off with you'Cause now I think it's time that you understoodWe're better off as twoI'm sorry but did I never mentionI'm better off with you'Cause now I think it's time that you understoodWe're better off as two
