You...Don't wanna hear your nameDon't wanna see your smile'Cause baby, I'm still cryingAnd go, it's time for you to get outI'm sick of standing my ground'Cause I just stand up runningAnd I go to sleeping believing in tomorrowBut I wake up screaming, halfway through the nightYou know I can't get overAnd I don't know whyYou know I can't get overNo matter how I tryAnd I don't know whyWe...Will always be the sameYou say it's time for a changeBut I can't see one comingSo I climb out of the darkness of your lovin'But I end up falling back into your armsYou know I can't get overAnd I don't know whyYou know I can't get overNo matter how I tryAnd I don't know whyFrom beginning to end once againRight back to where we startedI know, I'm rightWe were wrong all alongYou know I can't get overAnd I don't know whyYou know I can't get overNo matter how I tryYou know I can't get overAnd I don't know whyYou know I can't get overNo matter how I tryAnd I don't know whyYou know I can't get over
