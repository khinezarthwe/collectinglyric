Go!We've got our tracks coveredThanks to your older brotherIt's not the moonlight that sets me offIt's not the money that makes me scoffIt's my impeccable disorderWhere I keep on falling for herIt's not the way my mother talksIt's not the people that she mocksIt's the nature of the experiment(It's not the way my mother talks)It's the patterns of my temperamentIt's the nature of the experimentThey're taking me in incrementsWe're halfway up the bracketThe rain comes through my jacketIt's not the stones inside my shoesIt's not the risk of what's to loseIt's an ancient Russian proverbBut I doubt it's ones that you've heardIt's not the cracks beneath the floorIt's not the fact that it's a choreIt's the nature of the experiment(It's not the way my mother talks)It's the patterns of my temperamentIt's the nature of the experimentThey're taking me in increments
