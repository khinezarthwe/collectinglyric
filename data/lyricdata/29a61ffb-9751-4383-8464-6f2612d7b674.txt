I'm leaving on a fast trainDon't ask me when I'm coming back againI reckon it's only a matter of timeBefore the law kick in the doorMother I'm running out of change,but I had to phone to let you knowThey'll never take me aliveThey'll never take me aliveMother I killed someoneIt wasn't that I hated himYou see, he was trying to stop meBut he found outI've gone the whole wayThey'll never take me aliveThey'll never take meI can't tell you how I feelMaybe you don't wanna knowMaybe, maybeBut anyway, I love you soThey'll never take me aliveThey'll never take meThey'll never take me alive
