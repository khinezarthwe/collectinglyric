We met down in the valley, where the wine of love and destruction flowsThere in that curve of darkness where flowers of temptation growI left the rest for the others it was you and nothing elseYou felt so good to me baby, as good as life itselfYou were life itself, rushing over meLife itself, the wind in the black elmsLife itself, in your heart and in your eyesI can't make it without youI knew you were in trouble, anyone could tellYou carried your little black book from which all your secrets fellYou squandered all your riches, your love, your beauty and your wealthLike you had no further use for, for life itselfYou were life itself, rushing over meLife itself, the wind in the black elmsLife itself, in your heart and in your eyesI can't make it without youWhy the things that we treasure most slip away in time'Til to the music we grow deaf and to god's beauty blindWhy do the things that connect us slowly pull us apart'Til we fall away in our own darkness, stranger to our own heartsAnd to life itself, rushing over meLife itself, the wind in the black elmsLife itself, in your heart and in your eyesI can't make it without youSo here's one for the roadHere's one to your healthAnd to life itself, rushing over meLife itself, the wind in the black elmsLife itself, in your heart and in your eyesI can't make it without youLife itselfLife itselfLife itselfLife itself
