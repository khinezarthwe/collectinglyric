Come out from the worldand into my armslike wind on the water with mecome out from the citycome out from the townbuild stone by stone a wild mountain homeWhen the red moon wainswe'll be moving on the plainsthrough the tall grass out to the seaand we'll cross that watermy wild mountain loverlike wolves running silent and free(chorus)So if your love won't growand the rivers won't flowjust join that holy desert tribeis where we saddle up to rideyou know that wild mountain nationon the rise of going homeCome out from the worldand into my armslike wind on the water with mewith wings like the angelsand hearts like the sunbuilding stone by stonea wild mountain home(repeat chorus 2x)
