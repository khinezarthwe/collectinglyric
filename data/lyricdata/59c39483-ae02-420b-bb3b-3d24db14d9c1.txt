Passing the corners we've kissed in the rainPassing these old rusted warning signsWhat did they say?I think they said "Run!"Passing the roofs of excuses we've madePassing these open windowsWhat made me turn away?How did I fight the black days and the static nights?St. Rosa, she flies, she flies with the swallowsSt. Rosa, I feel I could follow back to CapistranoAnd I will hold you tightThrough the cold days and the frozen nightsPassing our enemiesPassing our friendsPassing the means we used to tell the difference betweenIt's subtleI try to remember if I was ever lonelyIf I was ever lowHell, hell yes, I was lowHow did I fight the black days and the static nights?St. Rosa, she flies, she flies with the swallowsSt. Rosa, I feel I could follow back to CapistranoAnd I will hold you tightThrough the cold days and the frozen nightsPassing all the days I switched to Auto-modeDays for which I've nothing to showPausing all the days I'm afraid I'll forgetThe day's only clear for a secondThe day's only clear for a secondDay's only clear for a secondBut I will hold you tightThrough the cold days and the frozen nightsYeah, but it's cold, cold, cold
