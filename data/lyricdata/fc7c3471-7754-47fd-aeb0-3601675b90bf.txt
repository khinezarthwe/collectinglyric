Lost in a dreamNothing's what it seemsSearching my headFor the words that you saidTears filled my eyes (eyes)As we said our last goodbyesThis sad scene replaysOf you walking awayMy body aches from mistakesBetrayed by lustWe lied to each other so muchThat in nothing we trustTime and againShe repeats let's be friendsI smile and say yesAnother truth bentI must confessI try to let go, but I knowWe'll never end 'till we're dustWe lied to each other again (but I wish I could trust)But I wish I could trustMy body aches from mistakesBetrayed by lustWe lied to each other so muchThat in nothing we trust (in nothing we trust)God help me please, on my knees (on my knees)Betrayed by lust (by lust)We lied to each other so much (so much)Now there's nothing we trustHow could this be happening to me?I'm lying when I say 'trust me'I can't believe this is trueTrust hurtsWhy does trust equal suffering?SufferingMy body aches from mistakesBetrayed by lustWe lied to each other so muchThat in nothing we trust (in nothing we trust)God help me please, on my kneesBetrayed by lustWe lied to each other so much (so much)Now there's nothing we trust (nothing we trust)My body aches from mistakesBetrayed by lust (by lust)We lied to each other so much (lied to each other so much)That in nothing we trustGod help me please (help me please), on my kneesBetrayed by lust (lust)We lied to each other so muchAbsolutely nothing we trust!
