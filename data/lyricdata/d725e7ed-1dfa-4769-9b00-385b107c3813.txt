I had a girl her name was LiezahShe had only one desireTo walk the cobbled streets aloneHeading anywhere but homeWith Crowley as her close companionHis Diaries went hand in hand withAll the men that she has knownShe leaves their silver but keeps their goldSo lawyers, doctors please bewareOf that girl with wavy hairFor she will cut you down to sizeReveal the truth behind your disguiseLiezahJust passed by yerNow you're standingEmpty handedLiezahCan't despise herShe'll change your lookShe'll have you hookedThe city sleeps as she's arrivingTongue tied and twisted was her timingHer eyes glazed in deep despairThose crocodile tears they don't careDon't turn your back cos she'll be goneChasing shadows in the sunAll along the dusty roadWhere she goes well we'll never knowAnd everytime I think of LiezahI break down and I start cryingAlthough she tore me apartThere's still a place for that girl in my heartLiezahJust passed by yerNow you're standingEmpty handedLiezahCan't despise herShe'll change your lookShe'll have you hooked
