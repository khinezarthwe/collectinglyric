Well, you're smoulderin' with fly wordsCatch the moment on the runAnd you say there's nothin' easyAbout the plywood tract you're fromAnd you stand inside your wind stiltsWatch the sentence act begunSo you say you lost your babyDon't you know that you're the one?And you stand and watch the trials goFrom here to there behind the sceneThrow your troubles to the moon trollsTo swallow up like stormy dreamsTake an entrance to a stand-offLooking if there's such a strifeAnd you say you lost your babyWondering if it's in your lifeAnd you fly your flags on MondaysThat take a rise and fall in oneAsk the questions of the pilgrimsThat come to pledge what's all that's doneClaim a tabernacle hillsideWhere you'll watch the dyin' sunAnd you say you lost your babyDon't you know that you're the one?So you say you lost your babyDon't you know that you're the one?So you say you lost your babyDon't you know that you're the one?
