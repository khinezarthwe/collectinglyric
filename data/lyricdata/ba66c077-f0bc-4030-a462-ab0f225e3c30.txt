You'll remember me when the west wind movesUpon the fields of barleyYou forget the sun in his jealous skyAs we walk in fields of goldSo she took her loveFor to gaze awhileUpon the fields of barleyIn his arms she fell as her hair came downAmong the fields of goldWill you stay with me, will you be my loveAmong the fields of barleyYou forget the sun in his jealous skyAs we lie in fields of goldSee the west wind move like a lover soUpon the fields of barleyFeel her body rise when you kiss her mouthAmong the fields of goldI never made promises lightlyAnd there have been some that I've brokenBut I swear in the days still leftWe'll walk in fields of goldWe'll walk in fields of goldMany years have passed since those summer daysAmong the fields of barleySee the children run as the sun goes downAmong the fields of goldYou'll remember me when the west wind movesUpon the fields of barleyYou can tell the sun in his jealous skyWhen we walked in fields of goldWhen we walked in fields of goldWhen we walked in fields of gold
