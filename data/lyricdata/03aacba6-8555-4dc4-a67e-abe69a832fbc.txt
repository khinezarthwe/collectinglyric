I'm not afraid of you now, I knowSo I climbed down from the bunk beds this slowI can talk back to you now, I knowFrom a few things I learned from this TV showYou can work late till midnight, we don't careWe can fix our own meals, we can wash our own hairI go to school before sunrise, in the coldAnd I pulled the alarm, and I kicked up the salad bowlsSince the time we meant to say much moreUnsaid things begin to take their tollAfter school we shoveled through the snowDrive upstate in silence in the coldYou can remind me of itThat I was lazy and tiredYou can work all your life asI'm not afraid of you anymoreIf I loved you a long time, I don't knowIf I can recall the last time you told me soHere in this house in PittsfieldThe ghost of our grandmother works at the sewing machine postHiding the bills in the kitchen on the floorAnd my sister lost her best friend in the Persian Gulf WarThere was a flood in the bathroom last MayAnd you kicked at the pipes when it rattled oh the river it madeStand there, tell me that I'm of no useThings unspoken break us if we shareThere's still time to wash the kitchen floorOn your knees, at the sink once moreYou can remind me that I was tiredYou can work late and give yourself upNow that I'm older, wiser, and working lessI don't regret having left the place a messYou can remind me that I was lazy and tiredYou can work all your life asI'm not afraid of you, anymoreAnymore
