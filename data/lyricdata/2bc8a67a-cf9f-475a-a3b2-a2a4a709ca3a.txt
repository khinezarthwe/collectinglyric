Cut out your pictures now, I know that you are near.Tack them into the frame for now, as I know that you'll be here.It's not just me you know, there's a lot of ruined smiles,And I remain so strong for them, even though,I'm burst inside.It was unexpected,But I always should have known,That you would lead a shortened life coz your light was running low.Felt I was one with you, and you reassured my head,Didn't seem the same when you were lying in your bed.No trips to our secret place since you left me on my own,You said that you would never leave and your soul would linger on.It was unexpected,But I always should have known,That you would lead a shortened life as your light was running low.You should have told me when,When you decided to give in.I wasn't ready for the blow,And now my sun has turned to snow.Cut out your pictures now I know that you are near.Tack them into the frame for now, as I know you won't be here
