After the alcohol and the anniversaryYou'll still be happier with a memoryAnd all of the taxicabs that were fit to drivePointed in a line and never did arriveHow many episodes will you put us throughBefore you realize there's better things to do?How many autographs can anybody signBefore the people get tiredOf standing in line?And I gotta let you knowI gotta let you knowI gotta let you knowThat we can't work it outI gotta let you knowI gotta let you knowI gotta let you knowThat we can't work it outThat we can't be helped nowYou and me can't work it outYou drove down the Brooklyn BridgeIn your expensive carYou lost all your magic whenYou left it at the barHow many accidents can a single person haveBefore they can't go back?
