When I first saw you standing there,you know, was a little hard not to stare.So nervous when I drove you home,I know, being apart's a little hard to bear.Sent some flowers to your work, in hopesThat I'd have you in my arms again.We kissed that night before I left, stillnow it was something I could never forget.You've got all that I needLooking at all or nothingBabe it's you and I, with you I know thatI'm good for something so let's go and give it a try.We've got our backs against the ocean, it's just us against the world.Looking at all or nothing, babe it's you and I.Looking at all or nothing, babe it's you and I.Let's take a chance, go far away, today, and never look back again.Since I said I loved you in Las Vegas.It's never been the same since then.You've got all that I needLooking at all or nothingBabe it's you and I, with you I know thatI'm good for something so let's go and give it a try.We've got our backs against the ocean, it's just us against the world.Looking at all or nothing, babe it's you and I.Looking at all or nothing, babe it's you and I.This is it, nothing to hide, one more kiss, never say goodbye.This is it, baby you are all mine.Looking at all or nothingBabe it's you and I, with you I know thatI'm good for something so let's go and give it a try.We've got our backs against the ocean, it's just us against the world.Looking at all or nothing, babe it's you and I.With you I know thatI'm good for something so let's go and give it a try.We've got our backs against the ocean, it's just us against the world.Looking at all or nothing, babe it's you and I.Looking at all or nothing, babe it's you and I.Babe it's you and I
