Kids out driving Saturday afternoon pass me byI'm just savouring familiar sightsWe share some history, this town and IAnd I can't stop that long forgotten feeling of herTime to book a room to stay tonightNumber one is to find some friends to say "You're doing wellAfter all this time you boys look just the same"Number two is the happy hour at one of two hotelsSettle in to play "Do you remember so and so?"Number three is never say her nameOh the flame trees will blind the weary driverAnd there's nothing else could set fire to this townThere's no change, there's no paceEverything within its placeJust makes it harder to believe that she won't be aroundOh, who needs that sentimental bullshit, anywayYou know it takes more than just a memory to make me cryAnd I'm happy just to sit here round a table with old friendsAnd see which one of us can tell the biggest liesAnd there's a girl, she's falling in love near where the pianola standsWith a young local factory out-of-worker, just holding handsAnd I'm wondering if he'll go or if he'll stay...Do you remember, nothing stopped us on the fieldIn our dayOh the flame trees will blind the weary driverAnd there's nothing else could set fire to this townThere's no change, there's no paceEverything within its placeJust makes it harder to believe that she won't be aroundOh the flame trees will blind the weary driverAnd there's nothing else could set fire to this townThere's no change, there's no paceEverything within its placeJust makes it harder to believe that she won't be around
