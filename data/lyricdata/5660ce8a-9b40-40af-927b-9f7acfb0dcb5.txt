This is not America, sha la la la laA little piece of youThe little peace in meWill dieFor this is not AmericaBlossom fails to bloom this seasonPromise not to stareToo longFor this is not the miracleThere was a timeA storm that blew so pureFor this could be the biggest skyAnd I could have the faintest ideaFor this is not AmericaSha la la la la, sha la la la la, sha la la la laThis is not america, noThis is not, sha la la la laSnowman melting from the insideFalcon spirals to the groundSo bloody red, tomorrow's cloudsA little piece of youThe little piece in meWill dieFor this is not AmericaThere was a timeA wind that blew so youngFor this could be the biggest skyAnd I could have the faintest ideaFor this is not AmericaSha la la la la, sha la la la la, sha la la la laThis is not america, noThis is not, sha la la laThis is not america, noThis is notThis is not america, noThis is not, sha la la la
