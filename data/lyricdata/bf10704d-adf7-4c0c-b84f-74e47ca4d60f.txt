(Chorus)It's his lucky day, that's a givenHe'll tick the box on the slip, and then just watch and learnHe's not addicted, he can stop any timeBut this is gonna pay he feels that this one will be fineThis time I know I'm gonna smash the betI foresee it smacked in the back of the netMen grip slips wipe their hands with sweatThe camera pans the away fans endTwenty quid for blues who thrash the redsThen cash that cash when the ref has saidMy mates out his pad's a messIt's getting late I've not dash yetOi, the question I have to ask myselfIs can I see us not battering themIf I can't see that happening thenI'm gonna put all my money down on one fat betNow I don't know the first thing about footballBut my instincts tell me this is my windfall(Chorus)It's his lucky day, that's a givenHe'll tick the box on the slip, and then just watch and learnHe's not addicted he can stop any timeBut this is gonna pay he feels that this one will be fineThis time I know I woulda cashed the lotI woulda held in my hand the whole jackpotThe game's won the ends haven't swappedTwo nil up they're getting mashed upBut I won't win now the chance flopped'Cause I couldn't make it to the damned shopMight as well put tea in that potI got nowhere else I have to bopThe question I have to ask oneIs how I managed not to manage the trodMaybe I can phone in and slap it onPut all my money on a mid-match oneYes I don't know the first thing about footballBut my instincts tell me this is my windfall(Chorus)It's his lucky day, that's a givenHe'll tick the box on the slip, and then just watch and learnHe's not addicted, he can stop any timeBut this is gonna pay he feels that this one'll be fineHmm shit,I'm mad glad I didn't back that matchSupposed to be a non-problematic catchFull time the whistle blasted afterThe last pass had passed the last passWould you believe how we fell back?Three goals lost in the last halfSo glad I was stranded back at the flatWincing at every goal we let them haveQuestion I now have to askIs how the fuck did we get smashed that bad?I just very very nearly nearlyLost every penny of all my cashYes I don't know the first thing about footballAnd my instincts almost lead me to a pitfall(Chorus)It's his lucky day, that was barmyHe didn't tick the box on the slip and what a reliefHe's not addicted, he can stop any timeBut next time he will be more lucky, next time will be fine(Chorus)It's his lucky day, that was barmyHe didn't tick the box on the slip and what a reliefHe's not addicted, he can stop any timeBut next time he will be more lucky, next time will be fineI need to rethink the technique of my betting shitMaybe change the parameters a little bitInstead of betting on to win the footballI'll to bet to lose the cricket
