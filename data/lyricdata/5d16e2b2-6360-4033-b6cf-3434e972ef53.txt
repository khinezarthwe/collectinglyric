I never thought that this day would ever comeWhen your words and your touch just struck me numbOh and it's plain to see that it's deadThe thing swims in blood and it's cold stony deadIt's so hard not to feel ashamedOf the loving living games we playEach dayAnd I'm stuck in a shackDown the back of the seaOh and I'm alive and I'm aloneInside a sick sick dreamOh is it meIs it me that feels so weakI cannot deceive but I find it hard to speakThe hardest walk you could ever takeIs the walk you take from A to B to CI walkOh honey I talkDon't want you to want meDon't want you to need meDon't want you to need meDon't want you to need meAnd I walk
