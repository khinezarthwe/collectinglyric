They come in the night and they're searching for preyThe look in their eyes will burn you awayPiercin' the wastelands they sweep thru the plainsCutting the darkness just like a bladeNothing can stop themThey're headed your wayDriven by vengeance and swinging the chainsThe grinding of metal, the clashing of steelBloodchilling screams streak thru the fieldsSCREAMS FROM THE GRAVESCREAMS FROM THE GRAVEThe sound of an icepick tearing the fleshHearing the cries emerge from the depthsCasually buthered at modern costInnocent beings turn to the lostNothing can stop themThey're headed your wayDriven by vengeance and swinging the chainsThe grinding of metal, the clashing of steelBloodchilling screams streak thru the fieldsApproaching the headstones lining the gravesThe remains were buried and given their namesThe horror still haunts meWhen I'm in the darkWatching the figures of yesterday's markNothing can stop themThey're headed your wayDriven by vengeance and swinging the chainsThe grinding of metal, the clashing of steelBloodchilling screams streak thru the fieldsSCREAMS FROM THE GRAVESCREAMS FROM THE GRAVESCREAMS FROM THE GRAVESCREAMS FROM THE GRAVE
