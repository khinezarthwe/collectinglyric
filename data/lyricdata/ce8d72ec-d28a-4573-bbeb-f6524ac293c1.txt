I was raised from a broken seed,I grew up to be an unwanted weedEver faster the time exceeds me,Little harder again to remember…you.Held a torch for you, when lightning stroke me,Once again, hope I died for the last timeOnly one I have a thing greater than you,Little light on the sky every nightMorning dew on the field, where I met youI was frozen a year, couldn't get throughGot a sign, not a scar, on my shoulder,I am not quite the man you take me for…Fell in love with the weakness within meTry to force me the Ring and own meGuess you found what you'd think would oblige me,Little version of me to consume youI'd give my everything to you,Follow you through the garden of oblivionIf only I could tell you everythingThe little things you'll never dare to ask meDo you really know me? I might be a GodShow me that you care and have a cryHow do you see me? As the one?Can you see my blood when I'm bleedingHow can you love this exile, and how could I desire youWhen my pain is my pain and yours is tooOn this deadwinter's nightDarkness becomes this childBless this night with a tearFor I have none I fearSeven lives of a man, passed before meSeven graves, one for every Love I've hadOnly once I have broken my so called heartOnly one made me see why they cryWill I learn how to be one of you someday?Will I still feel the eyes that behold meWill I hear what you think, when you see me?Will it tear me apart if you feel for meI'd give my everything to you,Follow you through the garden of oblivionIf only I could tell you everythingThe little things you'll never dare to ask meDo you really know me? I might be a GodShow me that you care and have a cryHow do you see me? As the one?Can you see my blood when I'm bleedingHow can you love this exile, and how could I desire youWhen my pain is my pain and yours is tooOn this dead winter's nightDarkness becomes this childBless this night with a tearFor I have none I fearLittle broken, always been,A part of you belongs to meYou were never mine to love,But this all has made it easy for meBurning feathers, not an Angel,Heaven's closed, Hell's soldoutSo I walk on the Earth,Behind the curtains, hidden from everyone,Until I find a new life to ruin againOn this dead winter's nightDarkness becomes this childBless this night with a tearFor I have none I fearOn this dead winter's nightDarkness becomes this childBless this night with a tearFor I have none I fear
