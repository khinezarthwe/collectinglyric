Just a mile or so awayIs my dearest friend in this worldHe wears the blue and I the greyAnd God it hurts me soThe last time we were togetherI grabbed his hand and I pledgedIf I ever draw my sword on youMay the good Lord strike me deadThe union flank's in troubleTo the round top on the doubleA bad decision, insubordinationExposed our line in a dangerous wayThe burden lies upon usSurrender is not an optionWe are the flanks and if we breakThe union crumbles, we could lose the warDown below's the carnageThe rebel's charging onwardPush the slaughter forward, the peach orchardThrough the Wheatfield and devil's denThe valor of the TexansAnd Alabama's best menThey're unrelenting and devastatingThe last full measure of devotion's clearChorus:We'll know what we are made ofWhen up against all odds we hold our lineFor the cause that we so loveWe must hold at all costsWe'll know what we're made ofWhen our nation needs us, we'll stay the courseFor the union we so loveWe must hold at all costsWave after wave, they're comingTheir power must be waningWe're out of Ammo, we can't fall back, no!A desperate measure, a means to endOn their next wave we charge themThere is no other optionDisconcert them, force submissionOn my command, fix bayonets!ChorusWe'll know what we're made ofThe burden lies with usWhen up against all odds we hold our lineWe can't failFor the cause that we so loveWe must hold at all costsWe'll know what we're made ofWith courage in our heartsWhen our nation needs us, we'll stay the courseWe won't failFor the union we so loveWe must hold at all costs
