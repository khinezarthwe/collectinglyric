Holy man tiptoed his way across the GangesThe sound of magic music in his earsVideoed by a bus load of touristsShiny shell-suits on and drinking lemonadeNow I got a funny feeling which I bought mail orderFrom a man in a tee-pee in CaliforniaSaid he once was that great game show performerThen he blew all his money awayBlew it all awaySo take me homeDon't leave me aloneI'm not that goodBut I'm not that badNo psycho killerHooligan guerrillaI dream to riotOh you should try itR.E.  parole get gold card soulMy joy of life is on a rollAnd we'll all be the same in the end'Cause then you're on your ownWell we all go high for day glow in the discosThe sound of magic music in our brainssomeone stumbles to the bathroom with the horrorsSays Lord give me time for I've jumped into spaceI'm in outer spaceSo take me homeDon't leave me aloneI'm not that goodBut I'm not that badNo psycho killerHooligan guerrillaI dream to riotOh you should try itR.E. parole get gold card soulMy joy of life is on a rollAnd we'll all be the same in the end'Cause then you're on your ownThen you're on your own
