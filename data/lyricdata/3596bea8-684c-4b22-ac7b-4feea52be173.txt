This is the place where all the junkies goWhen time gets fast but everything gets slowCan I get some vaseline?Step into a modern sceneTake a chance on that which seems to be the making of a dreamI don't wanna do it like my daddy didI don't wanna give it to my baby's kidChorus:This is my callingI said my darlingShocking appallingAll I can do to youHammers are fallingI said my darlingShocking appallingAll I can do to youThis is the place where all the devils pleadTheir case to take from you what they needCan I isolate your gene?Can I kiss your dopamine?In a way I wonder if she's living in a magazineI don't wanna say it if it isn't soI don't wanna weigh it but I've gotta knowChorus:This is my callingI said my darlingShocking appallingAll I can do to youHammers are fallingI said my darlingShocking appallingAll I can do to youI saw you out there yesterdayWhat did you want to sayA perfect piece of DNACaught in a flashing rayI caught you out there in the frayWhat did you want to sayA masterpiece of DNACaught in a flashing rayCan I smell your gasoline?Can I pet your wolverine?On the day my best friend died I could not get my carpet cleanI don't wanna take it up with little JoeI don't wanna fake it but I've gotta knowChorus:This is my callingI said my darlingShocking appallingAll I can do to youHammers are fallingI said my darlingShocking appallingAll I can do to youI am a misfitI'm born with all of itThe fucking ultimate of love inside the atom splitI'm in a flash rayA mash of DNAAnother poppin' Jay who thinks he's got something to say
