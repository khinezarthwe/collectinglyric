Yes it's been a long damn timeAin't been around cos' I work for my money!I'd love to stay but I'm really runnin' short on timeAnd I hear you've got a new manHe's like a new-age hippieAnd he's rollin' in the moneyNo... I don't really hold a grudgeIt's just hard for me...I feel like you already died...I feel like you already died...I feel like you already died!...I know it works out bad sometimesI'm glad we're friendsCos' we're hateful as loversI walk away knowing everything I said was lies!My heart and my mind have been all twisted...I can't get no sleep...I found the lighting in the grass line!...There's a blackness passing over meI've been transformed...
