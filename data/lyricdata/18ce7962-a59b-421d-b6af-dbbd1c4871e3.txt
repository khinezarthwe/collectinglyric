You  can steal my eyesCarve them out, I don’t even need themI don’t wanna see anyone other than youYou cover your face,you’re afraid to see the outcomeIt’s more than anyone person can bareYou take me for grantedYou take me for reasons known only by youYou take me for grantedYou take me for reasons known only by youYou pierce my heart, it uselessI don’t even really need itIt belongs to nobody other than youYou can cut off my tongue, I’m speechlessAnd I’m wasting away, to nothing at your feetYou take me for grantedYou take me for reasons known only by youYou take me for grantedYou take me for reasons known only by youIf my heart is made out of gold than why does it feel like I’m here all aloneAnd you take me for grantedYou take me for reasons known only by youI’m hollowed out, can’t you see?You’ve ripped out my soul right from under meHave little to show for anythingIt’s everything you hoped forYou take me for grantedYou take me for reasons known only by youYou take me for grantedYou take me for reasons known only by youIf my heart is made out of gold than why does it feel like I’m here all aloneYou take me for grantedYou take me for reasons known only by you
