There's so many people dyingYou complain about your situationWhat about meHalf the world wouldn't know what it's like to lose your seedMaybe you can understand how it feelsI cannot reach that soulYou're probably watching over usKnow that I think of youIt's killing meThe guilt has lastedYou still cryIt was all planned outWhy was I last to knowDon't you trust in meThe table's coldIt's too lateTo make up for these mistakesMaybe you can't understand how it feelsI cannot reach that soulYou're probably watching over usKnow that I think of youIt's killing me how it feelsIf I would have knownI can't say what I would have doneIf you could forgiveI'd like to rest with you someday
