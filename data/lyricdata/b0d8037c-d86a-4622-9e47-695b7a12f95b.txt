Real life is so hardWe hide in the starsThat's where our heads areMy head and your heartThis is a black outDon't let it go to wasteThis is a black outI want to detonateWhen you are so farI'm falling apartLose all my sonarYou jam my radarThis is a black outDon't let it go to wasteThis is a black outI want to detonateSometimes I feel I'm getting stuckBetween the handshake and the fuckYou've got me on guardI've got my head startMy head and your heartThe same in the starsThis is a black outDon't let it go to wasteThis is a black outI want to detonateSometimes I wish that I could changeI can't save you from my poor brainBrainBrainBrainOkay
