I know your life is emptyAnd you hate to face this world aloneSo you're searching for an angelSomeone who can make you wholeI cannot save youI can't even save myselfSo just save yourself(Save yourself)I know that you've been damagedYour soul has suffered such abuseBut I am not your saviorI am just as fucked as you(I am just as fucked as you)I cannot save youI can't even save myselfSo just save yourselfPlease don't take pity on mePlease don't take pity on mePlease don't take pity on mePlease don't take pity on meMy life has been a nightmareMy soul is fractured to the boneIf I must be lonelyI think I'd rather be alone(I think I'd rather be alone)You cannot save meYou can't even save yourselfI cannot save youI can't even save myselfSave yourselfSo just save yourself
