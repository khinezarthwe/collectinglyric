Come in, radio's onAnd everyone's dacing around on the lawnFather picks up his guitarHe's out there playing alongYoung girls from out of stateDancing their way on the china platesTearing apart all the drapesTurning them all into gowns for their paradeAnd I want you to know, while you're singing out of tuneI'll be in the back, making eyes across the roomSo, I guess if things go rightI could be out on the tiles all nightSo put my name on your dance cardAnd usher me out to the yard where the band playsAnd when it's over the lights are going outWhy don't you go home, these drinks are swimming in my headAnd I don't think I can make upstairs to find a bedSo i sleep in my clothes again,On the floor next to all my friendsAnd I wake up asking, what have I doneI'm kicking myself when the lights come back on
