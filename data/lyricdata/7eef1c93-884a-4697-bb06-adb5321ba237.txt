Had a scratch only you could itchUnderneath the Glebe Point BridgeAnd now every boy in a knitted vestHas got some precedentSo we took a personality pillAnd something red to swillAnd now every fire has gone outIn every heart that wanted to killLet's call it a dayEvery thought that once had a soundWe'll have to hide 'til no one is around'cause there ain't no room in the city todayFor explanations that you just can't sayFound out what shame can meanIn purple sneakers and grey jeansAnd every walk to a school that once made senseSure felt like an accidentLet's call it a dayChorus:For every trouble you foundThere's a drink to lose it and drownBut do you need somebody, to feel somebody?Every day that once had a soundWe'll have to hide 'til no one is in townI don't hate I just feel betterWhen no one else is aroundSo we'll take a personality pillAnd something red to swillAnd now every fire has gone outIn every heart that wanted to killLet's call it a dayChorus:For every trouble you foundThere's a drink to lose it and drownBut do you need somebody, to feel somebody?You can shave a million waysTo make damn sure that the twelve in you staysBut do you need somebody, to feel somebody?
