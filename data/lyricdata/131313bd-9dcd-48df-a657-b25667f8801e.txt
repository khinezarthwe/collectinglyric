Take a little dopeAnd walk out in the airThe stars are all connected to the brainFind me a woman and lay down on the groundHer pleasure comes falling down like rainGet myself a car, I feel power as I flyOh now I'm really in controlIt all looks fine to the naked eyeBut it don't really happen that way at allDon't happen that way at allYou sign your own name and I sign mineThey're both the same but we still get separate roomsYou can cover up your guts but when you cover up your nutsYou're admitting that there must be something wrongPress any button and milk and honey flowsThe world begins behind your neighbor's wallIt all looks fine to the naked eyeBut it don't really happen that way at allNah nah no, don't happen that way at allYou hold the gun and I hold the woundAnd we stand looking in each other's eyesIt all looks fine to the naked eyeBut it don't really happen that way at all
