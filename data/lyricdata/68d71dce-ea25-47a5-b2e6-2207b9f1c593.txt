And I've been getting urges late at nightTo walk and walk for days and throughout lightsThrough people's houses, picking food from platesThrough people's gardens, picking locks on gatesSo we are moving to a lighthouse, you and IWhile seas drown sailors, we'll be locked up safe and dryAnd though our doors may knock and rattle in the windI'll just hold you tight and we'll not let those fuckers inAnd I've been leaving gifts out in the woodsThat someone might stumble upon and wonder at their originsI've been feeling like a fox with sad old eyesWhose skulk has all moved on to leave the dark and empty den behindSo we are moving to a lighthouse, you and IWhile seas drown sailors, we'll be locked up safe and dryAnd though our doors may knock and rattle in the windI'll just hold you tight and we'll not let those fuckers inI'll anull these little walls of attrition and these invocationsThat's seen me holding my camera out at arms lengthTo self-document these new locationsWhen I should be leaning against youDeciding on things to get doneAnd you should be leaning on fountainsAnd filling my space up and breathing the air from my lungsNa na na naSo we are moving to a lighthouse, you and IWhile seas drown sailors, we'll be locked up safe and dryAnd we are moving to a lighthouse, you and IOur beams will burn the clouds to beacons in the skyAnd though our doors may knock and rattle in the windThe wind...I'll just hold you tight and we'll not let those fuckers in
