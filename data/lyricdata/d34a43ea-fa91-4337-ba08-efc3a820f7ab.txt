Took a phone call from a friend,Tired curled up in bedWaiting for something to happenSo he sits there all aloneWaiting for that golden sun in the Morning LightJust let go - Just let goLast year's gone so leave it all behindSo he tells me his last year,And what he'd like to changeI say to get down to the beach and to give us a callHe hears nothing at allSo he sits there all aloneWaiting for that golden sun in the Morning LightJust let go - Just let goLast year's gone so leave it all behindWhen fireworks punch the sky,sand stuck on my feet so tiredTried moving them around - but it's midnight here of a new yearAnd I'm feeling alrightIn the morning lightJust let go - Just let goLast year's gone so leave it all behind
