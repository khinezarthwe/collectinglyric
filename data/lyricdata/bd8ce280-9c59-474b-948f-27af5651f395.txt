Move slowlyBeyond the colors of my eyesMove slowlyInto the corners of my mindRising like the PegasusEach and every one of us releasedIslands in the sea of dreamsAlways searching harmony and peaceAll we findReject our mindDon't you wonder whyIf the war by heavens gate released desireIn the line of fire someone must have knownThat a human heart demands to be admired'Cause in the center of the universeWe are all aloneShow me sign of paradiseA place we all would like to go toTell me what to sacrificeSo there's a chance for me to want youAll I findReject my mindAnd I wonder whyIf the war by heavens gate released desireIn the line of fire someone must have knownThat a human heart demands to be admired'Cause in the center of the universeWe are all aloneI have a tale to be told won't you listen tonightFollow me into the core of the fountain of lightTry to imagine that hope is our ship for the soul(Over the ocean the quest of your life lies ahead)Maybe together we'll find there's a place for us all(Follow the star in your mind, sail along sail along)If the war by heavens gate released desireIn the line of fire someone must have knownThat a human heart demands to be admired'Cause in the center of the universeWe are all alone'Cause in the center of the universeWe are all aloneAll aloneAll alone
