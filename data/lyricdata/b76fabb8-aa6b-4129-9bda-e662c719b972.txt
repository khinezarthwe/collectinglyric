[music by cavestany, lyrics by osegueda]smell you eye youhow rapid the chase it is onswat you bite youlocked on your neck and you're downi can't believe that you're trying to put up a fighttry as you will but you'll never forget this dark nightcan't you see that to us it's not labor it's love(oh no)thicker than bloodrip you tear youpeeling your flesh to the corecrave you need youyour taste leaves us wanting much morei can't believe that you're trying to put up a fighttry as you will but you'll never forget this dark nightcan't you see that to us it's not labor it's love(oh no)thicker than bloodchew you eat yousavoring every small biteown you crush younight after night after nighti can't believe that you're trying to put up a fighttry as you will but you'll never forget this dark nightcan't you see that to us it's not labor it's love(oh no, oh no, oh no)thicker than bloodthicker than blood
