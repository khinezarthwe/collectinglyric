Watchin' every motionIn this foolish lovers gameOn this endless oceanFinally lovers know no shameTurnin' and returnin'To some secret place insideWatchin' in slow motionAs you turn around and sayMy loveTake my breath awayTake my breath awayWatchin' I keep waitingStill anticipatin' loveNever hesitatin'To become the fated onesTurnin' and returnin'To some secret place insideWatchin' in slow motionAs you turn around and sayMy loveTake my breath awayTake my breath awayThrough the hourglass I saw youIn time you slipped awayWhen the mirror crashed I called youAnd turned to hear you sayIf only for todayI am unafraidTake my breath awayYou take my breath awayYou take my breathYou take my breathYou take my breathAwayYou take my breath away (repeat til' fade)
