ShockCome up screamingCome up screamingHaI've never seen you look like this without a reasonAnother promise fallen through, another season passes by youShockI never took the smile away from anybody's faceAnd that's a desperate way to look for someone who is still a childIn a big country, dreams stay with youLike a lover's voice fires the mountainsideStay aliveI thought that pain and truth were things that really matteredBut you can't stay here with every single hope you had shatteredI'm not expecting to grow flowers in a desertBut I can live and breathe and see the sun in wintertimeIn a big country, dreams stay with youLike a lover's voice fires the mountainsideStay aliveIn a big country, dreams stay with youLike a lover's voice fires the mountainsideStay aliveSo take that look out of here, it doesn't fit youBecause it's happened doesn't mean you've been discardedPull up your head off the floor, come up screamingCry out for everything you ever might have wantedI thought that pain and truth were things that really matteredBut you can't stay here with every single hope you had shatteredShock, 1, 2I'm not expecting to grow flowers in a desertBut I can live and breathe and see the sun in wintertimeIn a big country, dreams stay with youLike a lover's voice fires the mountainsideStay aliveIn a big country, dreams stay with youLike a lover's voice fires the mountainsideStay aliveIn a big country, dreams stay with youLike a lover's voice fires the mountainsideStay aliveHaShock
