Recovering slowly, a torso fellFrom a beat up truck by a rural motelThe manager seen how the truck bed bouncedWhile dust flew up with a rolling soundVoices appear from the staff outsideIn bulbous text in a western styleHis mannequin neck spun to turn his faceThe bars spills drunks out frame by frameGirls pushed girls side to sideTo hear a suction sound as limbs realignThe crowd just seemed to multiplyThey hear his plastic jaw as the news drops hard:"Your retro career melted"They couldn't have agreed with the mannequin lessThey didn't understand what the mannequin meantThe sound of a barreled gun held to the backSome plastic clicks as the shell parts passFlesh tone shards fly by wildThey fill a plastic bag with the parts insideThe bag got dumped, a town nearbyThey reassembled fast as his voice dropped hard:"Your retro career melted"
