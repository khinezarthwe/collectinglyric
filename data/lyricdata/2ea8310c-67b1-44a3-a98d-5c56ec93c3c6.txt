8 o'clock, Monday night and I'm waitingTo finally talk to a girl a little cooler than meHer name is Nona, she's a rocker with a nose ringShe wears a two-way, but I'm not quite sure what that meansAnd when she walksAll the wind blows and the angels singBut she doesn't notice me'Cause she's watching wrestlingCreaming over tough guysListening to rap metalTurntables in her eyesIt's like a bad movieShe's looking through meIf you were me, then you'd beScreaming someone shoot meAs I fail miserablyTrying to get the girl all the bad guys want'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys wantShe likes the Godsmack and I like Agent OrangeHer CD changer's full of singers that are mad at their dadShe says she'd like to score some reefer and a fortyShe'll never know that I'm the best that she'll never haveAnd when she walksAll the wind blows and the angels singShe'll never notice me'Cause she's watching wrestlingCreaming over tough guysListening to rap metalTurntables in her eyesShe likes 'em with a mustacheRacetrack season passDrivin' in a Trans AmDoes a mullet make a man?It's like a bad movieShe's looking through meIf you were me, then you'd beScreaming someone shoot meAs I fail miserablyTrying to get the girl all the bad guys want'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys wantThere she goes again with fishnets onAnd dreadlocks in her hairShe broke my heart, I wanna be sedatedAll I wanted was to see her nakedNow I'm watching wrestlingTrying to be a tough guyListening to rap metalTurntables in my eyesI can't grow a mustacheAnd I ain't got no season passAll I got's a moped (moped, moped)It's like a bad movieShe's looking through meIf you were me, then you'd beScreaming someone shoot meAs I fail miserablyTrying to get the girl all the bad guys want'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want (There she goes again)'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want (There she goes again)'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want
