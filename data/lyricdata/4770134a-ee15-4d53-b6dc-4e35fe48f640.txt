The same situation's getting sadder by the secondThe air just filled with smokeUntil somebody spokeI never felt as foolish as you made me feelWhy'd you have to be so vagueYou always came across so vagueAnd I poured my heart outWhen the ship goes down, remind me to thank her'Cause we're all gonna be tied to the anchorAnd you and your friends can have a laugh at my expense'Cause I don't have a defenseThe only thing that matters if it matters at allIs the way that the pieces fallAnd why you always stand so tallThe only thing that matters if it matters at allIs what we don insteadIf you quit while you're aheadWhen the ship goes down, remind me to thank her'Cause we're all gonna be tied to the anchorAnd you and your friends can have a laugh at my expense'Cause I don't have a defense
