Will you join me in this dance, this dance of misery?Cradled in imposs- impossibilitySwooning, I am swept awaySwept off my feet, with step by step by stepWe take the lead as drop by drop, we start to bleedOh, we dance in misery, and we dance on, and we dance onOh, we dance in misery, lost in the arms of our miseryOh, we dance in misery, and we dance on, and we dance onSwept off our feet by our misery, we're swept into the shadowsWill you lend yourself to beauty that will horrify?Let me hide within your black, the still inside your eyesDeafened, caught within a crySo sensual, as step by step by step, I separateAs breath to breath, as I suffocateOh, we dance in misery, and we dance on, and we dance onOh, we dance in misery, lost in the arms of our miseryOh, we dance in misery, and we dance on, and we dance onSwept off our feet by our misery, we're swept into the shadowsSo who will follow, who is the lead?I know I'll leave a stain because I bleedAs we dance, we all danceWe all have no chance in this horrid romanceOh, we dance in misery, and we dance on, and we dance onOh, we dance in misery, lost in the arms of our miseryOh, we dance in misery, and we dance on, and we dance onSwept off our feet by our misery, we're swept into the shadows
