If I could bottle up the sea breeze I would take it over to your houseAnd pour it loose through your gardenSo the hinges on your windows would rust and colourLike the boats pulled up on the sand for the summerAnd your sweet clean clothes would go stiff on the lineAnd there'd be sand in your pockets and nothing on your mindBut every year it gets a little bit harderTo get back to the feeling of when we were fifteenAnd we could jump in the river upstreamAnd let the current carry us to the beginning whereThe river met the sea againAnd all our days were a sun-drenched hazeWhile the salt spray crusted on the window panesWe should be living like we lived that summerI wanna live like we live in the summerAnd I'll remember that summer as the right oneThe storms made the pavement steam like a kettleAnd our first goodbye always seemed like hoursIn the car park in between my house and yoursAnd if the summer holds a song we might sing foreverThen the winter holds a bite we'd never felt beforeBut time is like the oceanYou can only hold a little in your handsSo swim before we're brokenBefore our bones becomeBlack coral on the sand
