All I see is sand in my eyeAll I hear are prayersAll I think is believe me or dieAll I do is prepareMy god is the only oneMy way supremeIf you don't believe in meI will hear you screamMy god is the only oneMy way supremeAll I see is sand in my eyeAll I hear are prayersAll I think is believe me or dieAll I do is prepareNo one tells me I'm in the wrongNo one feels my painNo one else will walk on my ground andNo one will live to sayMy god is the only oneMy way is the wayIf you don't want to side with meYour soul will turn to clayMy god is the only oneMy way supremeNo one understands your waysNo one will sympathizeWe all think you wrap your religionTo keep what's left insideNo one is on your side, noNo one else wants to dieI don't want to say you're out of your headBut I can see right through your mindNo one understands your ways andNo one will sympathizeWe all think you wrap your religionTo keep what's left insideNo one is on your side, noNobody else wants to dieI don't want to say you're out of your headBut I can see right through your mindMy god is the only oneMy way supremeIf you don't believe in meI will hear you screamNo one understands your waysNo one will sympathizeWe all think you wrap your religionTo keep what's left insideNo one is on your side, noNobody else wants to dieI don't want to say you're out of your headBut I can see right through your mindMusic written by: Flotsam and JetsamLyrics written by: Eric A.K.
