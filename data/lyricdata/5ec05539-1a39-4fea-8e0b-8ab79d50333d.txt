I remember thinking murder in the carWatching dogs somersault through sprinklers on tiny lawnsI remember the graffitiWe are your children coming in with spray cans of paintI remember the sunset and the plains of cementAnd the way the night seems to turn the color of orangeadeIn this town cellular phones are hot with ~thieves~ (teens)In this town we all go to terminal pubsIt helps us sweat out those angry bits of lifeFrom this town, the English Army grind their teeth into glassYou know you'll get a kicking tonightSmell of puke and pissSmell of puke and piss on your stilettosHere comes that panic attackMy heart stopsThen it startsGive me a drinkI'll drink your roundI'll take you round the poleIt's cold up here (I see the universe waiting by a minibus)You'll catch the flu or you'll catch the cityEither wayYou'll catch the flu or you'll catch the city
