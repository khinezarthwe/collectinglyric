All right!Someone is out there; he's watching what I doFrom far in the distance, his eyes everywhereI look around me; there's no one that I seeBut still, I feel someone's controlling my mindSave your breath and runYou can't escape the oneTime has come; the world lies dyingOur faith has gone; our souls are cryingResurrecting paradise, cry for freedomKilling pain, a million liesDethrone tyrannyForces of evil, they never surrenderSooner or later, the dark era comesCrying man on the runHe's searching for freedomBut there will be noneTime has come; the world lies dyingOur faith has gone; our souls are cryingResurrecting paradise, cry for freedomKilling pain, a million liesDethrone tyrannyAnd as the world is dying slowly in our handsWe'll ask for reasons until the bitter endWho brings us all the sadnessWho brings us all the fearWho spreads disease and miseryAnd steals our destinyA poisoned heart of angerSowing the seeds of painAll see the darkened skylineAnd feel the deadly reignTime has come; the world lies dyingOur faith has gone; our souls are cryingResurrecting paradise, cry for freedomKilling pain, a million liesTo hell with tyranny!
