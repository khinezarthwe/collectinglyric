One hand on this wily cometTake a drink just to give me some weightSome Uber-Man I'd makeI'm barely a vaporThey shone a chlorine light on a host individual sinsLet's carve my aging face offFetch us a knife, start with my eyesDown so the lines form a grimacing smileClose your eyes to corral a virtueIs this fooling anyone else?Never worked so long and hardTo cement a failureWe can blow on our thumbs and postureBut the lonely are such delicate thingsThe wind from a wasp could blow them into the sea with stones on their feetLost to the light and the loving we needStill to comeThe worst part and you know itThere is a numbnessIn your heart and it's growingWith burnt sage and a forest of bygonesI click my heels, get the devils in lineA list of things I could lay the blame onMight give me a way outBut with each turn it's this front and centerLike a dart stuck square in your eyeEvery post you can hitch your faith on is a pie in the sky, chock full of liesA tool we devise to make sinking stones flyAnd still to comeThe worst part and you know itThere is a numbnessIn your heart and it's growing
