If you see me walking down the streetStaring at the skyAnd dragging my two feetYou just pass me byIt still makes me cryBut you can make me whole againAnd If you see me with another manLaughing and jokingDoing what I canI won't put you down'Cause I want you aroundYou can make me whole againLooking back on when we first metI can not escape and I can not forgetBaby you're the one, you still turn me onYou can make me whole againTime is laying heavy on my heartSeems I've got too much of itSince we've been apartMy friends make me smileIf only for a whileYou can make me whole againLooking back on when we first metI can not escape and I can not forgetBaby you're the one, you still turn me onYou can make me whole againFor now I'll have to waitBut baby if you change your mindDon't be too lateCause I just can't go onIt's already been too longBut you could make me whole againLookin' back on when we first metI can not escape and I can not forgetBaby you're the one, you still turn me onYou can make me whole againLookin' back on when we first metI can not escape and I can not forgetBaby you're the one, you still turn me onYou can make me whole againBaby you're the oneYou still turn me onYou can make me whole again
