There was a time, looking through myself,Wanting to pretendIf I escaped, I could fill myself.I don't think you can.Been far and wide, but that hole insideNever really leaves.I went away, what I really left,Left behind was me!It's telling meTo be on my way... home!Million miles away!A million miles away!I can't stay,I can't stayA million miles away!Each passing day, every passing faceSeems like such a blur.I long to beHome, silentlyLying next to her.Just to get back by her side is all,All I need to be.I went awayBut what I really left,Left behind was me!I need to beGetting on my way... home!Million miles away!A million miles away!I can't take,I can't takeA million miles away!It's telling meTo be on my way... home!I can't take,I can't takeMillion miles away!I can't take,I can't takeMillion miles away!I can't take,I can't takeMillion miles away!I can't take,I can't takeMillion miles away!I can't take,I can't takeMillion miles away!I can't take,I can't takeMillion miles away!I can't take,I can't takeMillion miles away!I can't take,I can't takeMillion miles away!I can't take,I can't takeMillion miles away!
