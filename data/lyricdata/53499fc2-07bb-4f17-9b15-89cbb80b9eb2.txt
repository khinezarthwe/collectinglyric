Always be carefulWhen you abuse the one you loveThe hour or the day, no one can tellBut one day goodbye will be farewellAnd you will never see the one you love againYou will never see the one you love againI have been thinking, what, with my final brain cellHow time grips you, sliming, in its spellAnd before you know, goodbye will be farewellAnd you will never see the one you love againAnd the smiling children tell you that you smellWell, just look at meA savage Beast, I've got nothing to sellAnd when I die, I want to go to HellAnd that's when goodbye should be farewellOne day goodbye will be farewellSo grab me while we still have the time
