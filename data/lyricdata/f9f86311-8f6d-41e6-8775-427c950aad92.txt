You'll never see the courage I knowIts color's richness won't appear within your viewI'll never glow the way that you glowYour presence dominates the judgments made on youBut as the scenery grows I see in different lightsThe shades and shadows undulate in my perceptionMy feelings swell and stretch; I see from greater heightsI understand what I am still too proud to mention... to youYou'll say you understand but you don't understandYou'll say you'll never give up seeing eye to eyeBut never is a promise and you can't afford to lieYou'll never touch these things that I holdThe skin of my emotions lies beneath my ownYou'll never feel the heat of this soulMy fever burns me deeper than I've ever shown... to youYou'll say don't fear your dreams; it's easier than it seemsYou'll say you'd never let me fall from hopes so highBut never is a promise and you can't afford to lieYou'll never live this life that I liveI'll never live the life that wakes me in the nightYou'll never hear the message I giveYou'll say it looks as though I might give up this fight...But as the scenery grows I see in different lightsThe shades and shadows undulate in my perceptionMy feelings swell and stretch; I see from greater heightsI realize what I am now too smart to mention... to youYou'll say you understand; you'll never understandI'll say I'll never wake up knowing how or whyI don't know what to believe in; you don't know who I amYou'll say I'll need appeasing when I start to cryBut never is a promise and I'll never need a lie
