Been round this road so many timesFeel like its skin is part of mineThis taste of milk is almost goneStill got my shame, but not for longBeen wrong so many times beforeBut never quite like thisAnd oh, it rained, but the rain all turned to pissI hope to make it home one dayI doubt that day will comeI know, by now, that my days they're all gone
