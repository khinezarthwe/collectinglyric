I know exactly what it isI know exactly why it burnsAnd I'm fairly sureThat they all should put their clothes back onYeah, put them right back on'Cause now there's no way to decideWhat's on my mindThere's so much talk about it, it's everywhereAnd these poor eyes of mineThey get no restAnd suddenly, all of my friends are at itWho thought they had these skills?I look at them and blushLet's not go over this againWhy would you rub it when it already hurts?And I'm fairly sureIt would be best if you restrained yourselvesDraw in the reins, my friendsI lose the ability to decideWhat's on my mindThere's so much talk about it, it's everywhereAnd these poor eyes of mineThey get no restAnd suddenly, all of my friends are at itWho thought they had these skills?I look at them and blushI turn around, but I think I hearYeah, at least to these ears... these doves are pecking away at each otherThere's so much talk about it, it's everywhereAnd these poor eyes of mineThey get no restAnd suddenly, all of my friends are at itWho thought they had these skills?I look at them and blushAnd I could roll away my eyesBut I'd still hear these awful sounds
