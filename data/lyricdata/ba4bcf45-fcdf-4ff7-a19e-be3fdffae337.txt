Was a long and dark DecemberFrom the rooftops I rememberThere was snow, white snowClearly I rememberFrom the windows they were watchingWhile we froze, down belowWhen the future's architecturedBy a carnival of idiots on showYou'd better lie lowIf you love me, won't you let me know?Was a long and dark DecemberWhen the banks became cathedralsAnd a fox became GodPriests clutched onto BiblesHollowed out to fit their riflesAnd a cross was held aloftBury me in armourWhen I'm dead and hit the groundMy nerves are poles that unfrozeAnd if you love me, won't you let me know?I don't want to be a soldierWho the captain of some sinking shipWould stow, far belowSo if you love me, why'd you let me go?I took my love down to Violet HillThere we sat in snowAll that time she was silent stillSo if you love me, won't you let me know?If you love me, won't you let me know?
