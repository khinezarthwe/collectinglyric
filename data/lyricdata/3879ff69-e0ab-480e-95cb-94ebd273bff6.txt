Tell me are you better?Now you put your life on holdI can't make it betterCause this story's getting oldAnd you took the only part of meMade it into a miseryNow I'm left in the coldWhile this story's getting oldThough I'm doneCan you bring the words I've soughtYou're always laying lowHow could I let you go?And did you get a new meOr something not quite the sameI know that it's been monthsBut I hope that this wasn't in vainAnd a million times I'm toldThat my story's getting oldTell me are you better?Now your new life starts to unfoldThough I'm doneCan you bring the words I've soughtYou're always laying lowHow could I let you go?I know I thought I've pushed you awayBut even if I hadn't have doneI doubt you would have stayedYou think you sing these wordsIn a match sweet awayBut if he won't make it better onAny note he playsThough I'm doneCan you bring the words I've soughtYou're always laying lowHow could I let you go?Though I'm doneCan you bring the words I've soughtYou're always laying lowHow could I let you go?
