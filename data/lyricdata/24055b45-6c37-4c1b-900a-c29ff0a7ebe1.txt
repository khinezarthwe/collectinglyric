You know it makes no difference.Whether we talk or not.And it's much harder going in us sometimes.And jumping down from the top.But if you talk to me I will listen to you.With my eyes, my ears, my heart.Do we both reach a state of grace?I will pull you out of modern secrets.Do we both trust because it's clear?Information gets to yourself as information greeting danger. Greeting danger.You know it makes no difference.If you remember times that I forgot.Sometimes we meet missed out here.But there's a need for a knod.Taking consciousness for granted.I need to hear your good self.Sit down, don't expect me to give in to it.And I would have given it right back.My senses would know why.Do we all reach a state of grace?I will pull you out of modern secrets.Do we both trust because it's clear?Information gets to yourself as information greeting danger. Greeting danger.Wenn Du mit mir sprichst.Ich will Dein tiefstes Inneres verstehen.Aber verlange nicht, dass ich Dir nachgebe.Du weisst, dass es keinen Unterschied macht.Ob wir miteinander sprechen oder nicht
