House is hauntedI just want to go for a rideOut and onBefore I set this room alightLeft aloneForever and for crimes unclearWith my patience goneSomeone take me far from hereYeahBurning that gasolineYeahBurning that gasolineNew day yawningAnother day of solitaireHouse is honestClearly more than I can bearDrag me offBefore I set my world on fireOut and goneThe sun will never set tonightYeahI'm burning that gasolineYeahBurning that gasolineNo what for'sOnly a can of redIt says danger on itI have found another wayBurning that gasolineYeahBurning that gasolineBurning it all the wayBurning it all the way
