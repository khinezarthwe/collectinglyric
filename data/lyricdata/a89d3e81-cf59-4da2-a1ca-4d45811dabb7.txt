At night they would go walking'Til the breaking of the dayThe morning is for sleepingThrough the dark streets they go searchingTo see God in their own waySave the night time for your weepingYour weepingSinging lalalalalalalalaiyAnd the night over London laySo we rode down to the riverWhere Victorian ghosts prayFor their curses to be brokenWe go underneath the archesWhere the witches are and they sayThere are ghost towns in the oceanThe oceanSinging lalalalalalalalaiyAnd the night over London layGod is in the housesAnd God is in my headAnd all the cemeteries of LondonI see God come in my gardenBut I don't know what He saidFor my heart, it wasn't openNot openSinging lalalalalalalalaiyAnd the night over London laySinging lalalalalalalalaiyThere's no light over London today
