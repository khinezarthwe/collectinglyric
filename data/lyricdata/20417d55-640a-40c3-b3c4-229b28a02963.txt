I need some protectionSomeone to show me the waySomeone who deserves itI want them to stayTo stick with me and tell meI'll never be weakAnd not disappearAfter a couple of weeksIt gets harder, harder, harderI used to be strong… off the groundI used to be invincibleAnd cope with problems I foundBut now it's all changingI'm falling apartI'm falling to piecesAnd I'm finding it hardSo hardIt gets harder, harder, harderListen up hereWhen you're going downYou're shaking everybody upAnd putting ‘em downThey're the only friends you've got nowIt gets harder, harder, harder
