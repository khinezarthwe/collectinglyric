I walk on decrepit bricksAnd kick sticks and rusty soda cansSimply for lack of better stimulationMotivation comes and goes like gas station patronsSo sedation compensates for unexpected vacations(Thank you)That's my pre-gratitudePost-please leave me alone that's just my rude attitudeNo dysfunction flip side, I'm just your ordinary citizenThey're waiting patiently for me to sin again, but then again (shit...)I'm really mommy's little angelBut that angel on my shoulder got strangledFor trying to tangle with his nemesis he caught him on the wrong dayAnd got cut like DJs spinning doubles -(let the fucking song play)I'm on my way to the storeIgnoring the city to purchase a pack of Marb redsWith a stack of rolled penniesI could go for Denny's, and my stomach holds plentyBut my pockets got holes, I guess the goal is to stay empty...Quite simply put, me and my pockets share interestI'll never fall in love with that pretty green-eyed temptressTwice (yeah right)I learned my lesson the first timeI just couldn't keep up with that ever-changing Jordan line of foot apparelParallel to many clones, my eye's vision monochromesWith seven shades and twenty tonesPlus I breath artistic, they eating everything I'm feeding themPut myself in every painting and use my spit as mat mediumAnd results of my childrenWe share the same genesCast the same reflection and interpret the same dreamsLike whoaLike whoaLike whoaWhoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoaAnd at night, I roam these streets with absolutely no purposeFeeling like I'm worthlessBut contrary to my last statement, I feel fineContent with the fact that I know this city's mineAnd at night, I roam these streets with absolutely no purposeFeeling like I'm worthlessBut contrary to my last statement, I feel fineContent with the fact that I know this city's mineI walk down dead end streets like I didn't see the signJust to turn around and walk backThat's fine and dandy, but what's whack is the fact I'm still walking...like "Thank god for walkmans"I'm only yawning cause these simply mindedMortals make me sleepySo what do I do? I resort to TVIn the seemingly lousy attempt to numb myselfWith lackluster imagesAnd insignificant information like "Willis was really Ty Bridges"Just to have the upper hand in monotonous conversation,And for lack of better stimulationI'm painting portraits of dysfunctional familiesWith gloomy faces rockin'"Don't Worry, Be Happy" t-shirts, and you're assuming I'm tasteless?You misconstrue it but your babies will embrace itThe basic essentials of a very bitter young manThat kicks rusty soda cansAnd walks on decrepit bricksWith a permanent pair of headphonesTrying to make these lectures stickI'll let the protesters picketLike they are going to make a differenceAnd watch them die before they realize that their cause was nonexistent(Like their cause was nonexistent)And at night, I roam these streets with absolutely no purpose (absolutely no purpose)Feeling like I'm worthless (feeling like I'm worthless)But contrary to my last statement, I feel fineContent with the fact that I know this city's mineAnd at night, I roam these streets with absolutely no purpose (absolutely no purpose)Feeling like I'm worthless (feeling like I'm worthless)But contrary to my last statement, I feel fineContent with the fact that I know this city's mineI walk on shitty city sidewalks stepping on every single crackReminiscent of that joke we used to say when we were snotty noseMy purpose got defeated when my mom turned paraplegicPlus I failed my civil service examThey said I cheatedNot to mention tainted urine samples and the attention span of a second-graderMore fascinated with building blocks than wasting time stressing his daily lessonHence the Ritalin, I've been gone with the wind like lucky lottery tickets since day one (one)I stepped on the left cause rights wrong (wrong)So what do I do? I resort to friendly games of ping-pong and sing a song of sixpenceI'm none the richer, I just kiss her on the lips and keep truckingAnd at night, I roam these streets with absolutely no purpose (absolutely no purpose)Feeling like I'm worthless (feeling like I'm worthless)But contrary to my last statement, I feel fineContent with the fact that I know this city's mineAnd at night, I roam these streets with absolutely no purpose (absolutely no purpose)Feeling like I'm worthless (feeling like I'm worthless)But contrary to my last statement, I feel fineContent with the fact that I know this city's mine
