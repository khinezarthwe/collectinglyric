Lady sing the blues so wellAs if she mean itAs if it's hell down hereIn the smoke-filled worldWhere the jokes are coldThey don't laugh at jokesThey laugh at tragediesCorner street societiesBut they believe herThey never leave herWhile she sings she make them feel thingsShe says, i can sing this song so blueThat you will cry in spite of youLittle wet tears on your baby's shoulderLittle wet tears on your baby's shoulderAnd I have walked these streets so longThere ain't nothing right, there ain't nothing wrongBut the little wet tears on my baby's shoulderThe little wet tears on your baby's shoulderLady lights a cigarette, puffs away, no regretTakes a look around, no regrets, no regretsStretches out like branches of a poplar treeShe says, i'm freeSings so soft as if she'll break, saysI can sing this song so blueThat you will cry in spite of youLittle wet tears on your baby's shoulderLittle wet tears on your baby's shoulderI have walked these streets so longThere ain't nothing right, nothing wrongBut the little wet tears on my baby's shoulderThe little wet tears on your baby's shoulderBut on this stageI've learned to flyLearned to singAnd learned to cryLittle wet tears on my baby's shoulderLittle wet tears on my baby's shoulderBut now it's timeTo say goodbyeSome might laughBut I will surely cryLittle wet tears on my baby's shoulderLittle wet tears on my baby's shoulderLady lights a cigarettePuffs away, and winter comesAnd she forgets
