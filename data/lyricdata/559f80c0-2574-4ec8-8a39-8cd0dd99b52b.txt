I have a story, a bitter anthem for everyone to hearAbout this kid who just don't like me, and that's a solid factThey say he's hunting me, and as you see, I'm all swelled up with fear'Cause I can't get him off my backIf you see JordanIf you see JordanHe makes me sickHe makes me sickHigh school's overHigh school's overAnd you still won't quitYou tried to fight me down at Tyler's BeachAnd man, I think that's greatYou nearly cried and said to yell at you like I do at all the girlsThen you drove home real quickDid you make it in time to masturbate?There's one too many of you in this worldIf you see JordanIf you see JordanHe makes me sickHe makes me sickHigh school's overHigh school's overAnd you still won't quitYou say it's chivalry, well, it's jealousy that led us to this songWon't play it often just at least until you're goneYou'll stop at nothing but the real thing, and everything up to that's pretendYou tried to brainwash all my friendsIf you see JordanIf you see JordanHe makes me sickHe makes me sickHigh school's overHigh school's overAnd you still won't quitFuck you, JordanFuck you, JordanYou make me sickYou make me sickHigh school's overHigh school's overI don't care if you dye your hairYou'll always be a little redhead bitch
