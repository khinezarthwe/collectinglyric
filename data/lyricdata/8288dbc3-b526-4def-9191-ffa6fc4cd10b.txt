Forget the worldcause it really doesn't matterWhen I called you on that SaturdayI didn't need the worldForget the worldthough I must admit I worriedYou're in such an awful hurry to escape the worldOh but there's no need to run away just yetForget the worldbut it never gives up the movingWhat exactly are you proving by ignoring itForget the worldyou just answered your own questionit always goes the same directionwhy bother exploring it?Looking in between the crackseverything you've seen is attractiveand the girls with pretty faces knowthere's not much more to likeSo don't repent candy bar sinnersand some things you can't sayAll in all, we're always beginnerslooking for the scenic route to hellor just a quick way back to the graveForget the worldyou and I don't really need itand there's no way to defeat itso just push it asideForget the worldYou can't run away foreverbut I say better now than everlet's have fun tonightI'm still young and already I'm bitterso something must be wrongI may quit but I'm not a quitterI just like moving onSo go on handlebar tenorsand sing your songs on highsoon will come the harshest winterand I can't take the coldness of your shoulderwhen I need a place to cryForget the world,cause soon enough it will forget youand that really doesn't fit youyou're a worthwhile girlForget the world,Cause it really doesn't need youAt least not as much as I doLet's forget the world
