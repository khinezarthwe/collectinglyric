I never thought I could live here on my ownBut then I guess everybody's got to live somewhereFour tins of paint made this our homeOh I got less on the walls than I got in my hairWhen we moved in here the dog was still a pupOh do you remember the time he chewed those curtains that we found?I laughed the day you put them upThe day you left I tore them downDon't laugh, don't even sighI touched your skin last nightBut your half of the bed was emptySo I guess I must have dreamt itI don't know whyDon't laugh, don't even tryI touched your skin last nightI didn't fall asleep 'til morningAnd then the next day I couldn't stop yawningOh how I tryThese bedroom walls are paper thinYou took a side in every neighbours' rowAnd those kids next door make such a dinBut sitting here it seems ever so quiet now
