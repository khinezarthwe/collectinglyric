Remember a day before todayA day when you were youngFree to play along with timeEvening never comesSing a song that can't be sungWithout the morning's kissQueen you shall be if you wishLook for your KingWhy can't we play today?Why can't we stay that way?Climb your favourite apple treeTry to catch the sunHide from your little brother's gunDream yourself awayWhy can't we reach the sun?Why can't we blow the years away?Blow awayBlow awayRememberRemember
