I'm sailing awaySet an open course for the virgin sea'Cause I've got to be freeFree to face the life that's ahead of meOn board, I'm the captainSo climb aboardWe'll search for tomorrowOn every shoreAnd I'll try, oh Lord, I'll tryTo carry onI look to the seaReflections in the waves spark my memorySome happy, some sadI think of childhood friends and the dreams we hadWe lived happily foreverSo the story goesBut somehow we missed outOn the pot of goldBut we'll try best that we canTo carry onA gathering of angelsAppeared above my headThey sang to me this song of hopeAnd this is what they said, they saidCome sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me, ladsCome sail away, come sail away, come sail away with meCome sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me, babyCome sail away, come sail away, come sail away with meI thought that they were angelsBut to my surpriseWe climbed aboard their starshipWe headed for the skies, singingCome sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me, ladsCome sail away, come sail away, come sail away with meCome sail away, come sail away, come sail away with meCome sail away, come sail away, come sail away with meCome sail away, come sail away, come sail away with meCome sail away, come sail away
