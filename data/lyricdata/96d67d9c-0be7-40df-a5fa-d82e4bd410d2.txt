I don't feel as if I know youYou take up all my timeThe days are long and the nights will throw you away'Cause the sun don't shineNobody ever mentions the weatherCan make or break your dayNobody ever seems to rememberLife is a game we playWe live in the shadows and weHad the chance and threw it awayAnd it's never gonna be the same'Cause the years are falling by like the rainIt's never gonna be the same'Til the life I knew comes to my house and says "hello"There ain't no sense in feeling lonelyThey got no faith in youBut I've got a feeling you still owe meSo wipe the shit from your shoesNobody ever mentions the weatherCan make or break your dayNobody ever seems to rememberLife is a game we playWe live in the shadows and weHad the chance and threw it awayAnd it's never gonna be the same'Cause the years are falling by like the rainAnd it's never gonna be the same'Til the life I knew comes to my house and saysHello, hello (it's good to be back, good to be back)Hello, hello (it's good to be back, good to be back)Hello, hello (it's good to be back, good to be back)Hello, hello, hello
