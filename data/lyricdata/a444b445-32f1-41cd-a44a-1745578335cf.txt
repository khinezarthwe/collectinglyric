Can you take me as I amAnd the sting of my sweat against your mouthYou judge me till there's nothing leftYou and your opinions wear me out(chorus)You don't know meI'm immune, I am freeNot a slave to your beliefsI'm immune, out of reachYou're alone, stuck with your diseaseYou hate the things that I say, and who I seem to beBut you don't look so normal to meServe your daily ritualsThen make up the rules to suit yourselfI'll never be what you areSo why don't I just start to hate myself(chorus)Can you take me as I amAnd the sting of my sweat against your mouthYou judge me till there's nothing leftWhile you and your opinions wear me out(chorus)
