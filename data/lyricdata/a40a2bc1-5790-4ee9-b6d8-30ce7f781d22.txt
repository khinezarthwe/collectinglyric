In the shadows I will be lurking, waiting for my time to comeNoone messes with the dealer, I could burn for what I've doneIn the night I will be watching, waiting for the man to showBlood is boiling in my brains, you never know of tomorrowNoone knows how far to goDelivering to the MasterDon't sweat it the man's gotta showDelivering to the MasterIn the night the sweltering sweat running down the back of my headLooking out for the man in black, One wrong move & I'm deadThe master calls I start to shake, burning inside with fearNo escape, no way out, my destination will soon be hereNoone knows how far to goDelivering to the MasterDon't sweat it the man's gotta showDelivering to the MasterThe moon has cast it's final glow, the sight of fogs in teh streetsWhite lines on a table of black, the only way I can ever find peaceHiding out paranoia sets in, evil runs through my veinsSuicide, the last resort wake up I'm going insaneNoone knows how far to goDelivering to the MasterDon't sweat it the man's gotta showDelivering to the MasterI'm looking out for someone who could destroy my mindI'm creeping 'round the corner biding my timeWaiting fo rthe set-up time, waiting for the attackThe heat is on the dealer, you're never comin' back
