There's just so many things you never needed to say.Like I'm your other soul, but you can love them all.Your tears are meaningless, they're written on your face.Just like your empty words, just like the chemical.Just like the disease that stains your lips tonight.You are the disease that's in my life.If it's no ones fault,There's just no one to blame and nothing to say.This time it's no ones fault.Oh, there's nothing to save and no one to hate.But I want to so bad.Believe me.There's just so many ways you never needed to be.Like cuts of empty space that never leaves your side.Now wipe that stupid look off of your face.You're not the finest one, you're not the only one.You're just a disease that stains the lips tonight.You are the disease that's in my life.If it's no ones fault,There's just no one to blame and nothing to say.This time it's no ones fault.Oh, there's nothing to save and no one to hate.But I want to so bad.Believe me.We're great in small dosesI pronounce it.You're satisfied loving me.You're so proud of yourself and your disadvantage to me.It's just something you love to say.The greater the dosage makes me mispronounce it to be.You're dead inside of me.You're dead inside of me.But when you're alone.And no one knows.It doesn't seem to matter.You're the same inside of me.If it's no ones fault,There's just no one to blame and nothing to say.This time it's no ones fault.Oh, there's nothing to save and no one to hate.If I say I want you so bad.It doesn't matter.Dont believe me.You're just the disease that was in my life
