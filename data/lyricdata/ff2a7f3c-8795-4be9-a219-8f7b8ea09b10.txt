Could I sit alone and ask about my future?When you replied I'd just turn awayI've been searching through my books to try and find some truthPerhaps disguise is a mysterious way?And if I made a promiseCould I stay by your side?Would you guarantee my safety?And say that I'd be alright?But if Judgement Day had started tonightAt least I'd know I was rightAnd I'd be laughing at the end of the worldTake my hand tonight, I think we'll be alright, girlAnd I can see it on the TVThere's an air attackPeople on the mountainsScreaming I'll be backAnd I'm banging on your doorSo come on and let me inNeed a place to hideI need a place to hide before the storm beginsIf I told you all the times when I'd done wrongCould you bathe my soul and wash it all away?I can't forgive the things that I can still rememberSo I think, my friend, these sins are here to stayAnd I could make a promiseWith a tear in my eyeAnd all the hope in my heartBut all the doubt in my mindAnd if Judgement Day had started tonightAt least I'd know I was rightAnd I'd be laughing at the end of the worldBut take my hand tonight, I think we'll be alright, girlAnd I can see it on the TVThere's an air attackPeople on the mountainsScreaming I'll be backAnd I'm banging on your doorSo come on and let me inNeed a place to hideI need a place to hide before the storm beginsBefore the storm beginsBefore the storm beginsBefore the storm beginsI need a place to hide before the storm begins
