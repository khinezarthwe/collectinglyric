Is it April yet?I forget sometimes how slowly summer passesYou disappeared into DeparturesOnly half a year agoIt seems like so much more, you knowI went a fortnight without so much as an emailThen a postcard scant of detailIn which you wished me all the bestFrom the non-specific north westShould it one day come to passThat you sit down to your memoirsWhere will this go?The chapter in your life entitled San FranciscoAre you warm enough?I remember how the fog comes off the waterAnd the days are ever shorterAnd I worry you’ll be coldOr have you found someone to hold?I spent the summer with the curtains drawn against itCounting all the nights you’ve wastedUnder unfamiliar starsShould it one day come to passThat you sit down to your memoirsWhere will this go?The chapter in your life entitled San FranciscoAre you ever coming clean?Or will I never know the meaningOf the lines you scribbled outSo that I couldn’t read between?Are you ever coming home?Or should I learn to do without you?Should it one day come to passThat you sit down to your memoirsWhere will this go?The chapter in your life entitled San Francisco
