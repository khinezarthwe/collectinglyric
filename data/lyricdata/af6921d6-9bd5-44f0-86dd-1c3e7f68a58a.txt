Could this be the end of sunlight's sacred friendWhere everything surrounds me in suffocating sandOh the end, the end, sunlight without endI've seen it in your eyes, I've seen it in your eyesI've seen it in your eyes, never say goodbye, againAgainCould this be the end of sunlight's sacred friendWhere everything surrounds me in suffocating sandOh the end, the end, sunlight without endI've seen it in your eyes, I've seen it in your eyesI've seen it in your eyes, never say goodbye, againAgain
