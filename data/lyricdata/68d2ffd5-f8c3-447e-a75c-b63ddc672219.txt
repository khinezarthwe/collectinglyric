Girl, I just can't live without youI know I hurt youThat's the last thing I meant to doSometimes I can be careless and blindCan you forgive the fool that I've been?You know I love youYou're the one thing I have that's trueMy life used to be nothing to meI never want to feel that again[Chorus: ]If you go away girlYou're taking my heart with youIf you go away girlYou'll be breaking my heart in twoIf you only stay girlI promise you the worldSo please don't ever go awayYou know I need youI'm so sorry that I made you cryYou are everything good in my lifeYour tears have finally opened my eyes[Chorus ]I was so wrong to ever look at another babyEven the strongest man can stumble and fallAnd I'll do anything for youAnything to be in your arms againBaby don't let this be the end[Chorus ]Girl, I just can't live without youNever, ever leave me girlYou promised your love to me foreverSay you'll never leave me girl [repeat and fade]
