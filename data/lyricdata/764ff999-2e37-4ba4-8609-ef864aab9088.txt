I know the night has reached that stage againWhere I never want to see my homeI know that you'll provide the brainsBut who'll provide the brawn?And if it comes down to me and himYou know I'd kiss you better…I kept the message that you sent to meBear with me…If you're scaredMy beliefs…Make me boundI think it's time we compiled a listOf places where we shouldn't goNow is not the time to lose your voiceEveryone should have a choiceAnd if you should ever fallYou know I'd kiss you betterI kept the letters that you sent to meClose your eyes…If you're scaredMy beliefs…Will make you drownYou, are you so scared that you're just gonna let it happen?You, are you so scared that you're just gonna let it happen?You, are you so scared that you're just gonna let it happen?You, are you so scared that you're just gonna let it happen?
