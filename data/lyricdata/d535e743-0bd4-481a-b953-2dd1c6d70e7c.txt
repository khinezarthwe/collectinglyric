It's pure obsessionThat's in your eyesSome call it dangerousI call it a crimeYou love your moneySay it loves you tooYou think it's the only thingThat shows you gratitudeI can't believe how you liveYou got nothing to give[Chorus:]It's all part of the greed machineMake your mark on theGreed machineCut out the heart of theGreed machineStare in your mirrorAnd tell me what you seeIs that a visionOr our societyNow you have to face itAnd why'd you have to liePut the poor back on the streetsAnd leave them here to dieYou can't afford the price you'll payYour soul stripped away[Chorus]Now you're dyingWhy should people careThey're all just tryingTo get their rightful shareWe have no pitySee they have it all their wayNo one to grieve for themOn their judgement dayYou have to face all your sinsYour hell now begins[Chorus]
