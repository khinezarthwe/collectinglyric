We did what we couldTo save this house from fallingBut it burns because it's woodAnd now you'll never call me darlingI coughed your nameI smoked all dayAnd I slept myself sleepyI was sleeping it awayDon't let it burnDon't get confusedDon't let it get to youWe did what we couldTo save this car from crashingYour pretty face is soaked in bloodYou know, I still find you dashingAirbag suffocatesYou need a little spaceThe rain on the windshieldI watched you limp awayDoesn't have to hurt?Don't get confusedDon't let it bother youDon't try to call you'll lose it allYou get used to her bad news,It's just bad news
