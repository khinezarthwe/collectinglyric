I never meant for you to get hurtAnd how I try, oh how I tryI could never give you just what you deserveAnother man would surely learnI know these words may only serve to twist the knifebut I'll strive to make them heardMaybe it's better now I've gone awayMaybe it's not, oh who can sayAnd though it's hard for me to sayI know you're better off this wayAnd when I told her I didn't love her anymoreShe criedAnd when I told her her kisses were not like beforeShe criedAnd when I told her another girl had caught my eyeShe criedAnd then I kissed her with a kissThat could only mean goodbyeAnd though it's hard for me to sayMaybe you're better off this wayAnd though it's hard for me to sayI know you're better off this wayGet away!(repeat)
