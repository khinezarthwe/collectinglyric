Love in our heartsTwist and turnI get caughtIn a cocoonThe flowers bloomAnd witherHearts that beatI shiverI go deepI go deepTranslucent skinI'd look right throughInto your mindI'd be consumedTwo hearts that beatAnd beat as oneAnd beat as oneI swimI go deep...I swim...I swim...I shiverI go deep...I go deep...I get caught...I go deep...I go deep...I swimI go deepI swim...I go deep
