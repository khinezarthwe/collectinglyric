There's a world where we can disappear into our own little stratosphereYou see the stars up in heaven baby? They belong to meYou and me are gonna learn to fly, the little pathways across the skyThere's nothing here that can hold you baby, come along with meThe rain falls down such a familiar soundI'm on the ground, wet, like the first time we metMaybe now it's time to say goodbye, put your skirt on hitch it highThere's a wind gonna take us, baby, close your eyes to seeThere's a world where we can start anew, set alight by sun and moonThe spirits cry in the rivers, baby, come along with meThe rain falls down such a familiar soundI'm on the ground, wet, like the first time we metOhh... Ohh... Brave the storm... OK...There's a sorrow in your eyes of green, a darker song I have never seenI see the earth in your body, baby, come along with meThe rain falls down such a familiar soundI'm on the ground, wet, like the first time we metOhh... Ohh... Ohh.... Brave the storm...
