Dead boy staresStrange to meet youDead boy caresSo great to see youIs it time to go?It's a place I knowI can't read yr mindI can't find the timeI can't feel the thrillI don't have the willDead boy daresBelieve in youDead boy staresAfraid that you will see himIs it time to go?Is it a place I know?I can't read yr mindI can't find the timeI can't feel the thrillI don't have the willI love you metallic blueI love you golden blueI miss you shining all aloneI miss you I don't know what to doI don't glitter like the stars aboveI don't glow like neon aloneDon't blush it's just the wind outsideDon't rush to be by my side
