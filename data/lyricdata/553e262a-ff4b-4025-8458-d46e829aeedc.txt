Losses, losers and more... Gain of life's pleasuresCohorts listen behind the doors,To a life, sheltered in... Less than zero in meAll my walls falling down... Pains aloft, miseryI'm sure that the lessons were learnedI'm sure that the punishments went well deservedBy the pawn in the plan... Taste of shit, bitternessWalk from me, everything, systematicallyCome on!  You're the one,You're the one to dredge up shit inside of me,In my pointless life of nothing...(Tell me!) what I'm supposed to be(Tell me!) who I'm supposed to be(Tell me!) what it takes to ascend(Tell me!) what it takes to livePatience, pleasures and rewards come in due timeStare at the sun... I'm bored in a life, meaninglessSoaking up all of me, like The Cross you worshipLife is loss... Look at meI'm sure that some day we'll wake upI'm sure that some day we'll wake from --the dream of success and focus,Tunneling to the light glowing deep 'side of meYou're taunting... I wake up!Come on!  You're the one,You're the one to dredge up shit inside of me,In my pointless life of nothing...(Tell me!) what I'm supposed to be(Tell me!) who I'm supposed to be(Tell me!) what it takes to ascend(Tell me!) what it takes to liveTell me now!... Tell me now!...Pain... Misery... Distress... Dismal...Nowhere!  Depressed!  Idiot!  Failure!Loser! (In me!)... Loser! (Who I am!)...Loser! (In me!)...Don't feel sorry... Don't feel sorry for me...Don't need your sympathy or empathyDon't need your sympathy inside of meDon't need your sympathy or empathyDon't need your sympathy inside of meDon't feel sorry... Don't feel sorry for me...Come on!  I know... You're the one,You're the one, numb to feelings inside of meWhy I've seized my vision! (*)(Don't need!) you to tell me who to be!(Don't need!) you to tell me what to be!(Don't need!) you to tell me how to ascend!(Don't need!) you to tell me how to live!*note:This line is a statement, not a question...as in, "Because you were numb to me, I seized my vision!"or simply, "You're why I've seized my vision!"And is why in the following alternative Chorus lines,"Tell me..." is replaced with "Don't need you to..."
