They can take our bonesAnd bury them deep under the riverBut we'll still be togetherAnd we cannot be defeatedThey can take our trombonesAnd pack them down there with usBut no matter how longs it takes usWe will not be defeatedWhen we dance, we dance togetherUnder the moon and under the weatherWe will lock our eyes forever in the nightWell, they can take our bonesAnd bury them deep under the riverBut we'll still be togetherAnd we cannot be defeatedThey can take our fistsAnd chop them off at the wristAnd we will shake our arms with bloody stumpsAnd we cannot be defeatedWhen we dance, we dance togetherUnder the moon and under the weatherWe will shake our arms forever in the night
