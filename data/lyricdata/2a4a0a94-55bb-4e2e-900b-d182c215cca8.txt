(Slug):(What's your name foo?)Rappers steppin' to meThey wanna get someBut most of them should go and try to boost their monthly incomeSpeaking over beats is the only time I feel completeI don't hear the weak and I don't fear defeatSo what you got?Connect the dots, I'll raise the potRemove the blood clot from the brain of hip hopThe name remains in tip-top shapeI'm still the back rapper scapegoat in the aim of their hateI came in late, took a chair in the rearBut my classmates were unaware how long I'd really been thereMy peers have been held back for years, holding back the tearsEverybody knows our name like we was the cast from "Cheers"So here's to the good times, tonight is mighty specialSo fasten your seatbelts, cause I'm gonna launch this vesselAin't gonna land until I'm bigger than EspoAnd bigger than ecstasy and bigger than techno(Chorus):I wanna bigger than Jesus and bigger than wrestlingBigger than the Beatles and bigger than breast implantsI'm gonna be the biggest thing to hit these little kidsBigger than guns, bigger than cigarettesA few years ago an ex-girl of mineAsked me to keep her name out of my rhymesSo I said this rhyme that I'm about to sayIt came from the heart and it went this way:Go to hell girl, you make me sick!I hope your new boyfriend gets cancer in his dickWhat the fuck makes you think I'd put your name on my record?there, now I feel a lot betterYou know what?I ain't drank a forty since I became old enough to drinkNot caught up in what the fuck these people thinkCause when I die they're gonna find the missing linkBut tonight I'm gonna vomit it in the kitchen sinkI'm suprised more of y'all don't get hit by carsMissing your surroundings, staring at the starsI'm lonely without a woman that wants to sparThat's why I spend so much time in these barsDrunk poolside, screaming, "Do or die!"Looking at the water asking, "Who am I?"Saw my reflection, Yes! I'm super fly!And as you can guess again, I'm too damn high(Chorus)(What'd they say to you?)But they said, "Drop dead."I can't, I got a lot leftMore than just another arrogant, asshole pot-headIn the top ten, who you love to hear on tracksSmiling for the camera while I surf upon your ear waxThis beer's flat and she kisses like a stripperI'm coming to terms with my status as a drifterGirl, I'm only in this town for one nightAnd these neon lights are keeping me distracted from my plightI feel like a legend on a leashMaking an effort to break every piece that I can reachYeah, I got something to say, and even more to teachBut first let me scrape these feces from my cleatsStanding on the roof, complaining to the moonThe only time I tell the truth is when I'm naked in my bedroomSoon I'm gonna reap the harvest of my strugglesBut from now on, y'all can call me sluggles(Chorus)Bigger than JesusBigger than wrestlingBigger than the BeatlesBigger than breast implants(x2)Bigger than guns, bigger than cigarettes
