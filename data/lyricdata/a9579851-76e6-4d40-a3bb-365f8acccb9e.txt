I pushed off the pierInfinity ran coldAnd filled up my earsThere's the weapon you holdThere's the thing that you hold it toAnd the thing you hold dearOh the speed of a yearIt runs the wood dryAnd water unclearThere's the thing you hold highAnd then there's the thing that you hold it toAnd the thing you hold dearI will be an enemyTo men seen in the lightDo you think it's alright?Yes, I think it's alrightIf you make the waves the sun makes the raysThe speed of the light can be trusted to preyTo prey on the fools that pushed off your pierThe whirling of pools runs clearSo I'll be out till the shimmering diesI'll be out till the shimmering diesIt's the wringing out the predatory nature of the skyAnd the ringing sound it makesWhen it's burning out your eyesIt's alright, it's alrightIt's the speed of the lightIt's the speed of a yearIt's the weapon you holdAnd the thing you hold dearOh my dear oh my dearIt's infinity's time to shine out hereIf you make the waves the sun makes the raysThe speed of the light can be trusted to preyTo prey on the fools that pushed off your piersThe whirling of pools runs clearDa da da dad umThe rocking of boats and the making of mirrorsThe whirling of pools running clearI hear them say "Put the weapon away"It's the thing that you know and my taking it away, I knowBut I'll find a way to let the dear thing go
