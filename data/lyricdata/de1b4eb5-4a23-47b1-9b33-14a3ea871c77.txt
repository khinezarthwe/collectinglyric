I really have to let you knowThe time has come for me to goI've seen it all, there's nothing left to sayIt's not about the job you quitThe boy you're with, the girl you live withThe time spent with a half-witIt's not about the things you've saidOr the things you told me in my bedThe promise of magicI'm going undergroundWill you let me know when you're going outta town?And will you take me downTo the here and nowYou knew just what to do to meThe things you learned in GermanyThe time when I was just a plaything(?)Now I am going undergroundI'm undercover as of nowI follow your shadowI'm going undergroundWill you let me know when you're going outta town?And will you take me downTo the here and nowKnock away holes in the ceilingTo bathe in the light of the morningI'm going undergroundAnd it may be hard to understandThe moment my aching handsThe momentI'm going undergroundWill you let me know when you're going outta town?And will you take me downTo the here and nowI will show you howI'm going undergroundWill you let me know when you're going outta town?And will you take me downTo the here and nowI'm going undergroundWill you let me know when you're going outta town?And will you take me downTo the here and now
