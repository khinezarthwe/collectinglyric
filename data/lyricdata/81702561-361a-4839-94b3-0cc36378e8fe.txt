If it be your willThat I speak no moreAnd my voice be stillAs it was beforeI will speak no moreI shall abide untilI am spoken forIf it be your willIf it be your willThat there is a voiceFrom the broken hillI will sing to youFrom this broken hillAll your praises they shall ringIf it be your willTo let me singFrom this broken hillAll your praises they shall ringIf it be your willTo let me singIf it be your willIf there is a choiceLet the rivers fillLet the hills rejoiceLet your mercy spillOn all these burning hearts in hellIf it be your willTo make us wellAnd draw us nearAnd bind us tightAll your children hereIn their rags of lightIn our rags of lightAll dressed to killAnd end this nightIf it be your willAnd end this nightIf it be your willAnd end this nightIf it be your willIf it be your willIf it be your willIf it be your will...
