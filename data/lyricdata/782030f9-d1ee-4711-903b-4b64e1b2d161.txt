Baby's black balloon makes her flyI almost fell into that hole in your lifeAnd you're not thinking about tomorrow'Cause you were the same as meBut on your kneesA thousand other boys could never reach youHow could I have been the one?I saw the world spin beneath youAnd scatter like ice from the spoonThat was your wombComin' down, the world turned overAnd angels fall without you thereAnd I go on as you get colderOr are you someone's prayer?You know the lies they always told youAnd the love you never knewWhat's the things they never showed youThat swallowed the light from the sunInside your room, yeahComin' down, the world turned overAnd angels fall without you thereAnd I go on as you get colderAlways someone's prayerAnd there's no time left for losin'When you stand they fall, yeahComin' down, the world turned overAnd angels fall without you thereAnd I go on as you get colderAll because I'm...Comin' down, the years turn overAnd angels fall without you thereAnd I'll go on and I'll lead you home andAll because I'm...(All because I'm...)And I'll becomeWhat you became to me
