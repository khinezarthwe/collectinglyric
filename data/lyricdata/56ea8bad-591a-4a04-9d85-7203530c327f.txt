Cold-- Am II'm beside myself because there's no one elseHave I grown-- so blindOnly God could save you if you knew your way to the lightSo fly away and leave it behindJust stay awake, there's no where to hideI see you cause you won't get out of my wayI hear you cause you won't quit screamin my nameI feel you cause you won't stop touchin my skinI need you-- coming to take you awayFrail and Dry--I could lose it all but I cannot recall, It's all wrongDon't you cry-- Clear away this hate and we can start to make it alrightSo fly away and leave it behindReturn someday with red in your eyesI see you cause you won't get out of my wayI hear you cause you won't quit screamin my nameI feel you cause you won't stop touchin my skinI need you-- Coming to take you AWAY!I see you cause you won't get out of my wayI hear you cause you won't quit screamin my nameI feel you cause you won't stop touching my skinI need you--- Coming to take you AWAY!AWAY!!!!!
