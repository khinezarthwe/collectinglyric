I won't forget youI won'tI won't forget your smileOr how you taken meOh how you taken meI won't forgetI let you walk with meOh take me homeBecause that nightIs so darkWhen you're aloneI let you goI let you goI let you goI let you goI let you goI let you goOh won't you let me beMyselfI wanna beMyselfI won't forget youI won't forget youI let you go...
