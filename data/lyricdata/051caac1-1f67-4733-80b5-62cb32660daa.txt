Lay where you're layin', don't make a soundI know they're watchin', they're watchin'All the commotion, the kiddie-like playHas people talkin', talkin'You, your sex is on fireThe dark of the alley, the breakin' of dayHead while I'm drivin', I'm drivin'Soft lips are open, your knuckles are paleFeels like you're dyin', you're dyin'You, your sex is on fireConsumed were the words to transpireHot as a fever, rattlin' bonesI could just taste it, taste itIf it's not forever, if it's just tonightOh, we're still the greatest, the greatest, the greatestYou, your sex is on fireAnd you, your sex is on fireConsumed were the words to transpireAnd you, your sex is on fireConsumed were the words to transpire
