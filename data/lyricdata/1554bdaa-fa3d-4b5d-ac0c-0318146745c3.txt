Don't you ever pretendThat we are more than friends?Despite the metal and wiresI still have human desiresI'll wait here til the endFor my dividendAnd when I turn off the lightsI'll wait here til the endOver and over she burns my circuitsI feel fire rushing through my wiresI can feel all the things that we can't shareWhen I hear your voiceIt fills me with noiseWas this meant to be?Are you corrupting me?Can't you just pretendThat we are more than friends?Despite the metal and wiresI still have human desiresOver and over she burns my circuitsI feel fire rushing through my wiresI can feel all the things that we can't shareOver and over she burns my circuitsI feel fire rushing through my wiresI can feel all the things that we can't shareThe satellites connecting us, protecting usOur makers have neglected usIt's not their faultIt's just the wayOver and over she burns my circuitsI feel fire rushing through my wiresI can feel all the things that we can't shareLa la la...I can feel all the things that we can't share
