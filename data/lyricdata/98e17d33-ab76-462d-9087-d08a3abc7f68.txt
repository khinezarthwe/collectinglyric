The breeze, from the graveyard keeps murmuring deathToo much time harbours thoughts in headsNow I´m compelled to careAbout my future going nowhereAs I stand here all alone in the cold wondering where I´m going to-dayThen a snowflake fell and it felt like a kiss now I´m O-K.The ringing from the bells keeps screaming out loveAs snow fell from heavens aboveDirectionless no moreEmptiness no moreNow I don´t feel so all alone in the cold wondering where I´m going to-dayThen a snowflake fell and it felt like a kiss now I´m O-K
