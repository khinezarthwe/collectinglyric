I´m travelling the wonderful lonelinessOf the headphone silenceFeels like noone can see meThey see right through meCuts me off from the rest of the worldThe useless strangers sharing my time and spaceThey might hear my humming, my tapping of fingers anywayAt least I have my thoughts all to myselfMy content and the view outsideI see a rainbow completeResting its feet on the hill and the groundWorks as an illustration to the soundThis is a whole in timeA couple of hours when the day isMore abstract than usuallyI star in this movieI play the part and unifyWith the soundtrack in my headIt could be morning it could be nightI could be anywhereThe headphone silence Which fills my headI´m travelling the wonderful lonelinessOf the headphone silence
