The horizon is a beltway that we may never crossThe tops of buildings tremble like children lorn and lostThe stain runs deep it's deeper than the blood upon the cross.The horizon is a beltway that we may never cross.You'll hear that distant love song when the wind blows rightHear the whistle blowing put a tear into your eyeYou hear the distant love song but widows know the lieThe horizon is a beltway, the skyline is on fire.The skyline is on fire, the skyline is on fireThe horizon is a beltway and the skyline is on fireYou come up from the lowlands to the city on the airWhere pilgrims and commissioners curate Christian fareFrom Havasu to Brownsville feel the long unbroken stareI wonder what it smells like in that city on the airYou'll hear that distant love song when the wind blows rightJust the same blue love song made my grand dad cryYou'll hear the whistle blowing put a tear drop in your eyeThe horizon is a beltway, and the skyline is on fire.The skyline is on fire, the skyline is on fireYou'll hear the distant love song, when the skyline is on fireThe skyline is on fire, the skyline is on fireThe horizon is a beltway and the skyline is on fireThis old house stood empty now for fifteen years or moreWillows falls half way to meet the weeds around the doorTime throws up her curtain and we know not who we areThe horizon is a beltway, the skyline is on fireYou'll hear that distant love song when the wind blows rightHear the whistle blowing put a tear drop in your eyeJagged as the jaw bone once the flesh expiresThe horizon is a beltway the skyline is on fire
