Through early morning fog I seeVisions of the things to beThe pains that are withheld for meI realise that I can seeThat suicide is painlessIt brings on many changesAnd I can take or leave them if I pleaseThe game of life is hard to playI'm gonna lose it anywayThe losing card of some delaySo this is all I have to sayThat suicide is painlessIt brings on many changesAnd I can take or leave them if I pleaseThe sword of time will pierce our skinIt doesn't hurt when it beginsBut as it works its way on inThe pain grows stronger watch I bringThat suicide is painlessIt brings on many changesAnd I can take or leave them if I pleaseA brave man once requested meTo answer questions that are keyIs it to be or not to beAnd I replied oh why ask meThat suicide is painlessIt brings on many changesAnd you can do the same thing if you please
