Criminals, doctors, cynics and believers.Preachers, teachers, murderers and bankers.The faithless and the Pope,the weight of our hopeon the girl with the world on her shoulders.The actor in the wings, to themocking bird that sings.From the bottom of the sea, to the penthouse suite.As I turn to walk away, I overheard her say,"We're all in here together".Love, hate, coincidence, fate.We trust, we lie, we live and we die.No matter who you are just cannot escape.That we're all in here together.Love, hate, coincidence, fate.We trust, we lie, we live and we die.I overheard her say,"you just cannot escape,we're all in here together."The ships on the harbour, the city's so tall,all that rise will eventually fall.there's nothing you can do,no nothing at all, for the girlwith the world on her shoulders.Making our way through space and time,warmed by the sun, making love to the moon.We're spinning each dayand we make some mistakes.but we're all in here together.
