All Alone... (x16)Leviticus-o...Deuteronomy...Snatch a piece of my wonderin'Distant-far like yonderin'Skin of my tooth likeSeat of my boot likeFly in my soup likeWhere's the waitress?Can't take this, really can't finish thisThese airs and all these gracesIt's my mistake, i make itJ-dub to the boom now make itBounce-wiggle bounce-wiggleShakin' all them bangs outChemical cutthroatsBound to blow the brain outCut to the brainThis ain't no gameI'll show no shameI'll birth this blameI'll twist this chainI'll twist againI'll push the bladeAs plain as dayKnown to what these sayers sayKnown to what these doers doWe shoot where who and you-know-whereWe's about to take it thereWe's about to make it clearWe happy or we lonesomeThe long jump, the beat heart, from start to finishTen spoons of spinachThe soul and the spillageThe cup that runneth overReturn of the ogre!ChorusClose your eyes and seeWhen there ain't no lightAll you'll ever beCome on save the night'Cause I don't believeWhen the morning comes, it doesn'tSeem to say an awful lot to meChorus
