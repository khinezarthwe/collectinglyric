Wide eyed sleepers death in motionDaylight creepers wearing all nightPain bleeding moments spilling overNon-existing as they crawl outInto a world that calls them real signThe contract it's the final act matterOf fact better take a step backRelax the show must go on no oneSo on and so on as if under mass hypnosisThe wide eyed sleepersFall into mass gravesThey'll feel safer in the dirt their own opinionsWon't be heard if askedCould you decide what any man is worth?Could you decide?The steal it with a handshake seal it with a smile it feelsLike an earthquake treats you like a child defeats youWith your mistakes leaves you in denial deceives youIn the first place lied to all the while they can't see anymoreHow their wide eyes have made them blind in spite of themselves
