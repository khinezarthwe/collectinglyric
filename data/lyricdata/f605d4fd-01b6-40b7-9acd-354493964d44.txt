Seems like forever and a dayIf my intentions are misunderstoodPlease be kind, I've done all I shouldI won't ask of you what I would not doOh, I saw the damage in youMy fortunate oneThe envy of youthWhy would they tell me to please thoseThat laugh in my faceWhen all of the reasons they've taught usFall over themselves to give wayIts not a question whether my heart is trueStreamlined, I had to pull throughLook for a new beginning on youOh, I got a message for youUp and awayIt's what I gotta doForgive what you haveFor what you might loseWhat would you say if I told you that I'm to blameAnd what would you do if I had to deny your nameWhere would you go if I told you I love youAnd then walked awayN' who would I turn to if not for the onesYou could not sayI told you when I found youIf there were doubts youShould be careful and unafraidNow they surround youAnd all that amounts toIs love that you fed byPerversion and painSo if my affections are misunderstoodAnd you decide I'm up to no goodDon't ask me to enjoy them just for youAsk yourselfWhy I would chooseTo prostitute myselfTo live with fortune and shame, oh yeahWhen you should have turned to the hearts of the onesThat you could not saveI told you when I found youAll that amounts toIs love that you fed byPerversion and pain
