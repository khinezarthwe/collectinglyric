No, I would not sleep in this bed of liesSo toss me out, and turn inAnd there'll be no rest for these tired eyesI'm marking it down to learning, I am.I don't think that I could take another empty momentI don't think that I could fake another hollow smileWell, it's not enough just to be lonelyI don't think that I could take another talk about it.And just like me, you've got needsAnd they're only a whisper awayAnd we've softly surrenderedTo these lives that we have tendered awayBut I would not sleep in this bed of liesSo toss me out, and turn inAnd there'll be no rest for these tired eyesI'm marking it down to learningI'm marking it down to learning, because I can.I don't want to be the one who turns the whole thing overI don't want to be somewhere where I just don't belongWhere it's not enough just to be sorryDon't you know I feel the darkness closing in?I tried to be more than meAnd I gave until it all went awayAnd we've only surrenderedTo the worst part left of these winters that we've madeBut I would not sleep in this bed of liesSo toss me out, and turn inAnd there'll be no rest for these tired eyesI'm marking it down to learningI'm marking it down to learningI am all that I'll ever beWhen you lay your hands over meAnd don't go weak on me, please...I know that it's weakBut God, help me.  I need this.I would not sleep in this bed of lies.So toss me out, and turn in.And there will be no rest for these tired eyes.I'm marking it down to learning.I'm marking it down to learning, because I can.
