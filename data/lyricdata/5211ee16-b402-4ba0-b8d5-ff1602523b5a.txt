It must seemPermanentIt must seemImportantIt must takeAll your controlNot to getObsessiveJust as pain becomes discomfortOver timeWhat the human soul can tolerateIs no surpriseIm rooted to my pathAnd Im blinded on the sidesWhy is it I feel so?I have everything I wantThe stuff of all my dreamsWhy is it I need so?In the same way pain can become humorOver timeThe scars that time will wash awayAre no surpriseIm rooted to my pathAnd Im blinded on the sidesWhy is it I feel so?I have everything I wantThe stuff of all my dreamsWhy is it I need so?I know youre insideBecause I can feel your lifeWhy is it I bleed so?And you thought that these timesWere just ordinary
