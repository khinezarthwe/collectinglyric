OH!Sometimes it feels like the juice isJust one hell of a squeezeI'm ringing out my handsDrinking in my happinessI love this shit and I hate this shitI need it just to surviveI've served my time, I've earned my keyAnd now I'm taking what's mineThat's all we are can't stop meSo what is it that you're fighting forIs it something that's worth dying for?Look me in the eyes, don't tell me!Is it in your heart, what you're striving for?A painful lesson learned is worth so much more (so much more)Can you open up your eyes and see?All lives we ask ourselvesIs this really what's meant for us?Take a close hard look at yourselfIt takes heart to face your realityI can't, I cannot give two shitsAbout your self doubtWhen it's time to rise, I won't sell myselfI won't sell myself out, I won't sell myself outSo what is it that you're fighting forIs it something that's worth dying for?Look me in the eyes, don't tell me!Is it in your heart, what you're striving for?A painful lesson learned is worth so much more (so much more)Can you open up your eyes and see?Every tale falls awayLike pages in the good book, like an autumn leaves decayEvery tale falls awayLike sand in an hourglass, the end of a perfect dayEvery tale falls awayLike pages in the good book like an autumn leaves decay,Every tale falls awayLike sand in an hourglassSo what is it that you're fighting forIs it something that's worth dying for?Look me in the eyes, don't tell me!Is it in your heart, what you're striving for?A painful lesson learned is worth so much moreCan you open up your eyes and see?
