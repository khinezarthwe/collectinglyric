Old light and new colours your picture hangs in the nightIs this the right time to set one free and go awayIn the emptiness behind you I will walk aboutSurely you'll miss me but long live the doubtWhat will replace usWhat will be our memory of this timeSecond hand impressionsHand them over so we can let it dieI remember one time when we were abroadI was laughing at a book I had boughtBut you were standing against the hotel wallFrozen in an unknown thought
