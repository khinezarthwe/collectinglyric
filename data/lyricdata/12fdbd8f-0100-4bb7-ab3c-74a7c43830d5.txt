Shining, I dont knowcan you see the bright light? Shining, shining, shiningI saw a UFO and nobody believes meI was sixteen miles from home with nobody in sightI saw a UFO but nobody believes meAnd Whats it gonna take to get me back home tonightCan you see the bright light? Shining, I dont knowIs it a reflection of anyone?
