Once upon a time when we were friendsI gave you my heart the story endsNo happy ever after now we're friendsWish upon a star if that might helpThe stars collide if you decideWish upon a star if that might helpWhat's it like to have loved and to lose her touchWhat's it like to have loved and to lose that muchWell I hope and I pray that maybe somedayYou'll walk in the room with my heartAdd and subtract but as a matter of factNow that you're gone I still want you backRememberingSurrenderingRemembering that partAll of my heartSpilling up in silk and coffee laceYou hook me up a rendez-vous at your placeYour lipstick and your lipgloss seals my fateSentimental powers might help you nowBut skip the hearts and flowers skip the ivory towersYou'll be disappointed and I'll lose a friendNo I won't be told there's a crock of gold at the end of the rainbowOr that pleasure and pain sunshine and rain might make this love growBut I hope and I pray that maybe somedayYou'll walk in the room with my heartAdd and subtract but as a matter of factNow that you're gone I still want you backRememberingSurrenderingRemembering that partAll of my heartYes I hope and I pray that maybe somedayYou'll walk in the room with my heartAnd I shrug and I say that maybe todayYou'll come home soonSurrenderingRememberingSurrendering that heartAll of my heart
