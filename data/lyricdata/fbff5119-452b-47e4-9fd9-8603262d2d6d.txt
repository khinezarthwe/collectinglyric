If you're gonna save the dayAnd you're hearin' what I sayI feel your touchYour kiss, it's not enoughAnd if you believe in meDon't think my love's for freeI won't take nothin' less then a deeper love[Chorus]Let me tell youYou, no I,I need a miracleI need a miracleIts more than physicalWhat I need to feel from youLet me tell youYou, no I,I need a miracleI need a miracleIts more than physicalWhat I need to get me through[Chorus]Tell me that you understandAnd you'll take me as I amYou'll always be the one to give me everythingJust when I thought no one caredYou're the answer to my prayersYou lift my spirits highCome on and rescue me[Chorus]
