Somedays I'm content to stay at homeBut other days I get restlessI can't stand to be aloneOkay, I've been known to cry in my sleepBut dreams often show what you don't want to knowWhen you're awake you're not so deepCould be a bad habit I need to breakOr some kind of sentimentThat I could learn to fakeMaybe it's the devil in my earAverting his eyes and whispering liesSo that no one can hearThere isn't anything between usMany times I listened to the things that people sayBut many times I disagreeAnd I see it a different wayCould say that it looks and tastes so realBut I wouldn't mind if I went blindMaybe then I'd learn to feelYes man, I'm so glad to be aliveIt's a beautiful day and my girl is okaySo we go out for a driveYes sir, I haven't felt my right in my headThere's no getting dressed when I get depressedI don't want to leave my bed
