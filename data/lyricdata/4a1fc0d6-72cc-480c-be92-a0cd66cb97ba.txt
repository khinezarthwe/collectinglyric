Magnificent wonder Mrs. BeanYour daughter's under her chairShe's hiding her face, her legs, her hairYou've got them all so very cleanYou've done so well, you've keptSo you must have an angel under your spellThe people watching from the streetThey'll know her name so wellLike they know your nameLa da daOh and it feels like thunder outsideMagnificent watch you have my dearI wonder could I take a peakThe grandfather clock behind that wallHe hasn't ticked for a week, noIt's quiet and dark the whole of the dayIt's like a lovely, lonely nightThe clowns'll be coming out at threeGet ready, are you feeling alrightNo I'm not alrightLa da daOh and it feels like thunder outside
