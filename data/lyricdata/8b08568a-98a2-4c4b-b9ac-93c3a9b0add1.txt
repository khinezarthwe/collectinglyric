The summer sun that blows my mindIs falling down on all that I've ever knownIn time we'll kiss the world goodbyeFalling down on all that I've ever knownIs all that I've ever knownA dying scream makes no soundCalling out to all that I've ever knownHere am I, lost and foundCalling out to allWe live a dying dreamIf you know what I meanAnd all that I've ever knownIt's all that I've ever knownCatch the wheel that breaks a butterflyI cry the rain that fills the ocean wideI tried to talk with God to no availI called Him up in-and-out of nowhereI said, "If you won't save me, please don't waste my time"All that I've ever knownIt's all that I've ever knownCatch the wheel that breaks the butterflyI cry the rain that fills the ocean wideI tried to talk with God to no availI called Him up in-and-out of nowhere"And if you won't save me, please don't waste my time"The summer sun that blows my mindIs falling down on all that I've ever knownIn time we'll kiss the world goodbyeFalling down on all that I've ever knownIs all that I've ever known
