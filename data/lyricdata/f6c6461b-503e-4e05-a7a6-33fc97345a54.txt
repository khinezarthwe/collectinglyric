Tell me if I'm going crazyBut everything you said amazed meIt seems too easy on the ear toBe something I should adhere toYou told me to just simply wanderRather than take shelter underAnd open my heart to the thought thatLife is something you're not caught atToo easy to get lost in progressI didn't see you there in that dressAnd suddenly the world seems so smallWe'd fit it all inside out front hallAnd Edison would spin in his graveTo ever see the light that you gaveDon't wanna take it nice and slow hereDon't wanna waste a minute more dearThe universe just vanished out of sightAnd all the stars collapsed behind the pitch black nightAnd I can barely see your face in front of mineBut it is knowing you are there that makes me fineMaybe its the warmer climateMaybe I'm a smarter primateMaybe its the beer i'm drinkingMaybe I've stopped over thinkingBaby you're the words and chaptersThe sweetness in the morning afterYou are the cry that turns to laughterYou're the hope that ends disasterThe universe just vanished out of sightAnd all the stars collapsed behind the pitch black nightAnd I can barely see your face in front of mineBut it is knowing you are there that makes me fineThe universe is just an empty spaceAnd all the stars can disappear without a traceI'm so glad that this has taken me so longBecause it's the journey that made me so strong
