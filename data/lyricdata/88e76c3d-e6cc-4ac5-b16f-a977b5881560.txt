I love the dress sense and the colour of your hair.The way you say that people who are working, they are aiming to be posh my dear.People flocked around you by the smokeys in our school. Teachers they contained in all their anger as you regularly broken their rules.And everyone done the pill. But solvent abuse it can kill.The first taste of heaven there was splattered on the screen. Floating with the schemers and the part-time Halloweeners and the Lochee team.And everyone done the pill. But solvent abuse can kill.5 Rebecca's all of them close to me,1 of them's a cook, 1 of them does history,1 of them's my niece and 1 lives close,The 1 I love the most has turned into a Junky.So under satisfied with minors at your age, and something so deceiving when you find you're self-conceiving on a holy day.So unachievable with minors at your height, and something so deceiving when you find yourself conceiving on a Sunday night.And everyone done the pill. But solvent abuse can kill.5 Rebecca's and all of them close to me,1 of them's a cook, 1 of them does history,1 of them's my niece and 1 lives close,The 1 I love the most has turned into a Junky.Poor Miss Rebbecca you'll be missed my girl. If it wasn't for the treasure you'd be rich my girl, saved you from the terror and your so-called friends. Took a back seater but they kicked it in the end though.Your sitting really cosy in your humble black cave doesn't seem likely for a girl your age.Us cupid little kids can never look back, when one of us is lying in a big brown bag.5 Rebbecca's and all of them close to me,1 of them's a cook, 1 of them does history,1 of them's my niece and 1 lives close,The 1 I love the most has turned into a Junky.I love the dress sense and the colour of your hair.The way you say that people who are working I can tell you: that's a touch my dear.
