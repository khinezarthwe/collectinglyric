Oh well a young man ain't got nothin' in the world these daysI said a young man ain't got nothin' in the world these daysYou know in the old daysWhen a young man was a strong manAll the people they'd step backWhen a young man walked byBut you know nowadaysIt's the old man,He's got all the moneyAnd a young man ain't got nothin' in the world these daysI said nothingEverybody knows that a young man ain't got nothin'Everybody!Everybody knows that a young man ain't got nothin'He got nothin'Nothin'Take it easy on the young manThey ain't got nothin' in the world these daysI said they ain't got nothin'!They got sweet fuck-all!
