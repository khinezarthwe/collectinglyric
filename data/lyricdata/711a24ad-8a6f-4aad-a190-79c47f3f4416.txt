DearheartTake a look at youI know how it feelsBranches full of fruitLife streaksAnd surges all in greenThe bounty of the rainThe bounty of the springDearheartYou can't keep them allI wait with eyes closedI'll lighten your loadTruth hurtsRemember this:We are pooling our faith(You said it)Asking for my basketfulShake looseAll your garnet jewelsWhatever sustains meGifts and pampers youTrees dropPlums in my open mouthI wait with eyes closedParadise my ownTruth hurtsHold onto this:We are pooling our faith(You said it)Juice burstsDon't let it dripWe are pooling our faith(You said it)
