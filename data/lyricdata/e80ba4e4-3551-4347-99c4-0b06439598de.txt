The light out, we don't talkThe light out, we sleep nowThe door locked, the door lockedWe don't talk, we sleep nowI hold youI hold the soundWe sleep nowIt's safe now, we can moveThe world is over, the world is overIt's early still, the sun is coldThe world is over, the world is overI hold youI hold the soundI hold the soundI hold the soundWe walk now, we can breatheThe earth is flat, the sky is roundIt's early still, the moon is coldWe walk now, we walk aloneI hold youI hold the soundI hold the soundI hold the soundI hold the soundThe light out, we don't talkThe light out, we sleep now
