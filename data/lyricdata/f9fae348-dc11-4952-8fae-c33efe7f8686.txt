I know you know that you're divine.Push the envelope, wild child, come on x15Sometimes you feel like you're running around in the clouds,Sometimes you feel like you're living your life wasting time,Oh you're so true yet so blue ~ is it all in your mind?Tell me, amaze me, seduce me, you still make it mine.Push the envelope, wild child, come on x4
