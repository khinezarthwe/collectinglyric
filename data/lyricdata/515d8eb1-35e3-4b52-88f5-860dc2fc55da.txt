She's pushing 5 6In her saucony kicksShe got lips like a sofaAnd she's strunged out on sodaAnd the devil was a girlAnd she wore a yellow teeIt would be a spitting imageBut it's ok with me[Chorus]She saysI got something I think I really wanna tell yaI got something I think I really wanna show yaI got something I think I really wanna do right nowOh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ohShe bought a 7 inchIt was pressed on whiteIt was randy described.....eternityIt's the flip of her hairIt's the sound of her verbsIt's the shape of her legsIt's the way that she cursesShe saysI got something I think I really wanna tell yaI got something I think I really wanna show yaI got something I think I really wanna do right nowOh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ohShe saysI got something I think I really wanna tell yaI got something I think I really wanna show yaI got something I think I really wanna do right nowOh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ohI got something I think I really wanna tell yaI got something I think I really wanna show yaI got something I think I really wanna do right nowOh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
