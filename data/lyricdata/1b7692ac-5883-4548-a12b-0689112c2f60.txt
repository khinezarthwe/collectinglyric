The song is overIt's all behind meI should have known itShe tried to find meOur love is overThey're all ahead nowI've got to learn itI'm gonna sing outI'll sing my song to the wide open spacesI'll sing my heart out to the infinite seaI'll sing my visions to the sky high mountainsI'll sing my song to the free, to the freeI'll sing my song to the wide open spacesI'll sing my heart out to the infinite seaI'll sing my visions to the sky high mountainsI'll sing my song to the free, to the freeWhen I walked in through the doorThought it was me I was looking forShe was the first song I ever sangBut it stopped as soon as it beganOur love is overIt's all behind meThey're all ahead nowCan't hope to find meThis song is overI'm left with only tearsI must rememberEven if it takes a million yearsThe song is overThe song is overExcepting one note, pure and easyPlaying so free, like a breath rippling by
