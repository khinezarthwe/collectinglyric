You're tied down, you're locked upYou've got no way outYou're broke down you're fed upYour lungs start to shoutYou're wincing, convulsingYou're aching with painGasping for breath, and you're feeling insaneHole after holeJust proving your pointPoint after pointJust digging you holeSlow digging with a spoonHooked!You're hooked on a drug that's controlling your mindHocking your soul for that measly last dimeYou're dragged off and thrown in your own padded cellYou've reached end of rope at bottom of wellYellow-black arm-hole of eager junk acceptanceThin steel prick cums in your armI see you fall over and over againHanging onto nothing you thought was a friend
