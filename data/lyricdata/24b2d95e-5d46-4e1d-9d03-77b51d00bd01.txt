Some people get bit from the insideWhen they talk it's cold and sourAnd no, there's nothing they can do nowThey've had their way too many timesIf you glare to get what you wantIt'll become your lookIf there's dirt you've got on someoneYou'll let it loose without a thoughtJust let the poison spillSpurt from your throatHiss like steamBecause the pressure is unrealI'm not saying that it's notYou're causing a sceneYou're wearing out that noteYou scream until it's goneYou scream until it's gone, gone, goneNo government check can reverse itYou'd need a royal eclipse of the tongueOr is the pain that you endure noSomething you needWell, you know how to get itThere's no climbing up that listYou just move down it one by oneYou hate this and this and love that it showsYou're insecure, but that's no excuseJust tell them they lieYou tell them the truthThe things you won't take are coming in groupsThe people abused the trust that you hadAnd now you don't want it back
