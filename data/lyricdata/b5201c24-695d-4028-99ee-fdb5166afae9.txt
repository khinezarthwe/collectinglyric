I always said she was a runner,And running through the fields,I put a gun, I put a gun to her,With the force she came to kneel,And as she screams and in her own blood,I said sympathy for you,I'll never have, I'll never have none,Its time you told the truth,And I left the gun beside her,And running in the nights,I run for land, I ran for safety,For new places and new sight,Always said she was a runnerAnd I thought I knew her well.I never thought I was a runner,And I thought I knew her well.You should have died that very night,Good job for you I wasn't born a killer,You took my life, and I took my flight,Good job for you I wasn't born a killer.I always knew her as a baker,But something I knew not,Is That when I tried to take her,There was something Ides forgot,For I knew I couldn't keep her,And running out of time,I tried so hard, I tried to cheat her,She was a running in her prime,So I thought about my choices,And chose to drop the gun,And amongst the screaming voices,Something told me I should run.I never thought I was a runner,And I thought I knew her well.I never thought I was a runner,And I thought I knew her well.You should have died that very night,Good job for you I wasn't born a killer,You took my life, and I took my flight,Good job for you I wasn't born a killer.There is so much to remember,But there is more to forget,I isn't seen you since December,I'm surprised we haven't met,And In the Depths of the Silly Isles,I heard you reside, and in the depths of my mind,I can still see your eyes
