On a bus stop bench sat an ancient ladyIt was clear she was dead yeah we all could agreeAnd that death had arrived quite unexpectedlyCause the poor wretch died with a book on her kneeChrissy kiss the corpseChrissy kiss the corpseDavid drew a mustache under her noseNick put a burning match between her toesI put a cockroach in her pantyhoseChrissy put on some lipstickand struck a dramatic poseChrissy kiss the corpseChrissy kiss the corpseChrissy's such a pretty lassas benign as broken glassNo one in her family knowsthe vile hobby that she choseSome cops came by so we hid behind a treeI peeked out and they noticed meAnd said fondling the dead is a felonyBut you got nothing to fear'cause we only came to seeChrissy kiss the corpseto see Chrissy kiss the corpseChrissy's such a pretty thinggentle as a scorpion stingNo one ever would suspectthat her mind's completely wrecked
