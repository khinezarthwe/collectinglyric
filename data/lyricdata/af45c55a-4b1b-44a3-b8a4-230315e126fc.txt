Across the pathless sandsThrough jungle, blind I runNo guide taken in handAnd no idea where to turnNo sanctuary foundI tear myself in twoI pray for scarlet fields to save meWhole and white and pureI can't control myselfLend one of your hands 'cause II can't control myselfI dream of lost desiresFingers run through furI drive myself insaneThe rain cascades onto the dirtAnd in the throes of loveWhere the shadows burst in flamesI cast myself abandonedWith a cry I call your nameI can't control myselfI try and I try but II can't control myselfI can't control myselfLend one of your hands 'cause II can't control myselfOr hold myself in though I tryI can't control myselfDeliver me from the fireI can't control myself
