Slip inside the eye of your mindDon't you know you might findA better place to play?You said that you'd never beenBut all the things that you've seenWill slowly fade awaySo I'll start a revolution from my bed'Cause you said the brains I had went to my headStep outside, summertime's in bloomStand up beside the fireplace, take that look from off your faceYou ain't ever gonna burn my heart outAnd so Sally can waitShe knows it's too late as we're walking on byHer soul slides away"But don't look back in anger", I heard you sayTake me to the place where you goWhere nobody knowsIf it's night or dayBut please don't put your life in the handsOf a rock 'n' roll bandWho'll throw it all awayI'm gonna start a revolution from my bed'Cause you said the brains I had went to my headStep outside 'cause summertime's in bloomStand up beside the fireplace, take that look from off your face'Cause you ain't ever gonna burn my heart outAnd so Sally can waitShe knows it's too late as she's walking on byMy soul slides away"But don't look back in anger", I heard you saySo Sally can waitShe knows it's too late as we're walking on byHer soul slides away"But don't look back in anger", I heard you saySo Sally can waitShe knows it's too late as she's walking on byMy soul slides away"But don't look back in anger, don't look back in anger"I heard you say"At least not today"
