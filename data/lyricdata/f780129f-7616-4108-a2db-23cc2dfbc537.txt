Every second of every minute of the dayI let my fancy playAnd when the feeling strikes meI deliquesce in the sky without waving goodbyeWhile contemplating (ooohhhooohhhooohhh)A fractured pale cathedral wallDeath can't touch me at allLet its rapacious fingers with venomous stingers tryI'd like to see them tryTry to find a way to spike the sensesTil everything goes white (x3)Try to find a way to spike the sensesI had a vision of vinyl spiders in a cagenow I avoid the stage'Cause though it was a trifleI still can't stifle the fearThat they might just reappearTry to find a way to spike the sensesTil everything goes white (x3)Try to find a way to spike the sensesClimbing climbing climbing never fallingIf it was up to me I'd freak the cloudsLet them fall and drip to the seaI think the chemicals have doneSome evil thing to me
