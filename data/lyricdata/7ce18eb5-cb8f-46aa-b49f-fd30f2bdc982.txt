Somebody save me from domestic suicideDon't try to sell me on the safer things in lifeFeel me, hold me, hate me, scold me, never change your mindTake me, know me, kiss me, stone me, open up my eyesCause I'm dying(Chorus)I'll never leave you underneathAlways want your companyI need your loveI am defectiveI'm a diehard and a fiendNot off the bullshit train,The truth is what I needFeel me, hold me, hate me, scold me, never change your mindTake me, know me, kiss me, stone me, open up my eyesCause I'm dying(CHORUS)Do you ever remember when we stayed up throught the nightI will always remember how you made me feelI'll never leave you(CHORUS X2)Cause I'm dyin'!
