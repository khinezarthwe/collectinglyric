Tell me that we still belongTell me that the will is still aliveThere must be another chance for us tonight'Coz everyone who's walked uponTrouble or lies, they come and goWe can be the lucky onesAnd find love, after the stormDon't let go'Coz it's just a step from heavenAnd the strength of love is on our sideSoon you'll findThat our faith will take us higher'Coz we're just a stepBaby just a step from heavenWe don't need to justify our emotionsWe don't need to worry 'coz if they hold onThere's a bigger destiny that was made for usSo don't let troubles bring you downBelieve in the foundation of our loveCan't you see my faith in youIs forever and moreDon't let go'Coz it's just a step from heavenAnd the strength of love is on our sideSoon you'll findThat our faith will take us higher'Coz we're just a stepBaby just a step from heavenHeaven, oh yeahHeaven, oh yeahBaby can't you seeThis love was meant to beWe can rise above this pain in our heartsDon't let go 'coz it's just a step from heavenAnd the strength of love is on our sideSoon you'll findThat our faith will take us higher'Coz we're just a stepBaby just a step from heavenHeaven(repeat to fade)
