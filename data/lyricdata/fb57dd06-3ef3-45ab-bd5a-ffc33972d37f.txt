I'm in the sky tonightThere I can keep by your sideWatching the wide world riot and hiding outI'll be coming home next yearInto the sun we climbClimbing our wings will burn whiteEveryone strapped in tightWe'll ride it outI'll be coming home next yearCome on get on, get onTake it till life runs outNo one can find us nowLiving with our heads undergroundInto the night we shineLighting the way we glide byCatch me if I get too highWhen I come downI'll be coming home next yearI'm in the sky tonightThere I can keep by your sideWatching the whole world wind around and roundI'll be coming home next yearCome on get on, get onTake it till life runs outNo one can find us nowLiving with our heads undergroundI'll be coming home next yearI'll be coming home next yearEverything's alright up hereIf I come downI'll be coming home next yearSay goodbye, say goodbyeSay goodbye, say goodbyeI'll be coming home next yearI'll be coming home next yearEverything's alright up hereIf I come downI'll be coming home next yearI'll be coming home next year
