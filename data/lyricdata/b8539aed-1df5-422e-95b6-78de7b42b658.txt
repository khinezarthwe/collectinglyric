In demon days, it's cold insideYou don't get nobody, people sighIt's so bad, lasting far, but love yourselfHiding in a hole in thereAll the glasses are too bigBring it back, got to hold it backTo let you do that yet you don't want me backBefore it fall down, falling down falling downFalling out to go far from the sunIn these demon days it's so cold insideSo hard for a good soul to surviveYou can't even trust the air you breatheCause Mother Earth wants us all to leaveWhen lies become realityYou numb yourself with drugs and TVPick yourself up it's a brand new daySo turn yourself roundDon't burn yourself, turn yourselfTurn yourself around into the sun!In these demon days it's so cold insideSo hard for a good soul to surviveYou can't even trust the air you breatheCause Mother Earth wants us all to leaveWhen lies become realityYou numb yourself with drugs and TVPick yourself up it's a brand new daySo turn yourself roundDon't burn yourself, turn yourselfTurn yourself around into the sun!To the sun, to the sun...To the sun, to the sun...
