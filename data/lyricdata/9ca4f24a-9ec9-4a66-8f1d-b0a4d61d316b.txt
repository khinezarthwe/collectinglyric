I built a time machineI'm going to see the homecoming queenTake her to the Christmas danceMaybe now I'll get in her pantsWhateverBack with my high school friendsMeeting where the train tracks endPassing round a skinny jointRolling up to Lookout PointI want to pull it apart and put it back togetherI want to relive all my adolescent dreamsInspired by true events on movie screensI am a one man wrecking machineBack in my parents' houseBack to the shouting out loudOne day you'll be a manOne day you'll understandI want to pull it apart and put it back togetherI want to relive all my adolescent dreamsInspired by true events on movie screensI am a one man wrecking machineInspired by true events on movie screensI am a one man wrecking machineHere in the present tenseNothing is making senseWaiting for my moment to comeEverything has come undoneI tried to pull it apart and put it back togetherNo point in living in those adolescent dreamsInspired by true events on movie screensI am a one man wrecking machineInspired by true events on movie screensI am a one man wrecking machine
