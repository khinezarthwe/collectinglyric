There is no end to thisI have seen your faceBut I don't recognize all these thingsYou must have left behindIt's a problem, you knowThat's been there all your lifeI try to make you see the world without youThat just turned black and whiteAt night it gets cold andYou'd dearly like to turn awayAn escape that failsMakes the wounds that time won't heal aloneAlone, alone, aloneThere is no end to thisI can't turn awayAnother picture but the sceneIs still the sameThere is no room to moveOr try to look awayRemember, life is strangeThe life keeps getting stranger every dayI try so hard but this attitude'sA type that won't subsideNo matter what they sayRemember your heart beats you late at nightYour heart beats you late at nightYour heart beats you late at nightYour heart beats you late at night
