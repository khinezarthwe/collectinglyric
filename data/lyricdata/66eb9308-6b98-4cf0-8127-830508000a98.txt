Don't think me unkindWords are hard to findThey're only cheques I've left unsignedFrom the banks of chaos in my mindAnd when their eloquence escapes meTheir logic ties me up and rapes meDe do do do de da da daIs all I want to say to youDe do do do de da da daTheir innocence will pull me throughDe do do do de da da daIs all I want to say to youDe do do do de da da daThey're meaningless and all that's truePoets, priests, and politiciansHave words to thank for their positionsWords that scream for your submissionAnd no one's jamming their transmission'Cause when their eloquence escapes youTheir logic ties you up and rapes youDe do do do de da da daIs all I want to say to youDe do do do de da da daTheir innocence will pull me throughDe do do do de da da daIs all I want to say to youDe do do do de da da daThey're meaningless and all that's true
