Everyone makes one mistakeOne more time for old times sakeOne more time before the feeling fadesOne that's born of memoriesOne more bruise you gave to meOne more test just how much can I take?Because you're not the one but you're the only oneWho can make me feel like thisYou're not the one but you're the only oneWho can make me feel like shitSomething never meant to beEverything you meant to meWake me when this punishment is doneThose who try and get awayFrom the one who gets awaySomeone's always someone else's oneBecause you're not the one but you're the only oneWho can make me feel like thisYou're not the one but you're the only oneWho can make me feel like shitYou're not the one but you're the only oneWho can make me feel like thisYou're not the one but you're the only oneWho can make me feel like shitUntil the end of timeIn another lifeUntil the day I dieSave it up for one more trySave it for the last goodbyeWe go on and get off and get on and get offYou're not the one but you're the only oneWho can make me feel like thisYou're not the one but you're the only oneWho can make me feel like shitYou're not the one but you're the only oneWho can make me feel like thisYou're not the one but you're the only oneWho can make me feel like shitYou're not the one but you're the only oneWho can make me feel like thisYou're not the one but you're the only oneWho can make me feel likeOh shit!
