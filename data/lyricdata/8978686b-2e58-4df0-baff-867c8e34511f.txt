Pay attention, my love, 'cause it's overAt the tip of my tongue is the price you weren't willing to payStill, this is something akin to a breakdownAnd your impression of a woman supposed to be easy to seeThat there'd be torn up photos and lonely nightsCursing, crying, and drawn out fightsMake up sex and a brand new startBroken promises for broken heartsWhen you look back now was it special?Or was it nothing but an anecdote that you can tell now and thenAnd I delude myself, it was worth itMm, even though from the beginning I could see exactly how it would endThat there'd be torn up photos and lonely nightsCursing, crying, and drawn out fightsMake up sex and a brand new startBroken promises for broken heartsTorn up photos and lonely nightsCursing, crying, and drawn out fightsMake up sex and a brand new startBroken promises for broken heartsI wanna wish you away, wanna wish you awayWanna wish you away, wanna wish you awayWanna wish you away, wanna wish you awayWanna wish you away, I wanna wish you awayWanna wish you away, wanna wish you awayWanna wish you away, I wanna kiss you awayTorn up photos and lonely nightsCursing, crying, and drawn out fightsMake up sex and a brand new startBroken promises for broken hearts
