You step on the purple veilEmit shards of a screaming halo.You strap on your rainbow sail.Rainbow resin, oh sticky cycloneOh, how i love the smell of your charred remainsNothing betterThan to meet you sweetheart in severed chainsOh it's love forever.Yeah, I'll always be your friend.Oh yeah, at least just till the end.Our burn out switch is hitInstant meltdown, freak fry the ghost town.Fresh battery head trip.Love it to death, hot ghoul child skum sound.Never leave you alone, harsh and heavy drone.Decode the sizzle soft beat.Pre-historic love, electric catacomb.The question marks buzz through thee.Yeah, I'll always be your friend.Oh yeah, at least just till the end.Oh pardon me, purple veil.Take care of the girl who loves you.She rides the hot hot railDevotional Dharma crackles above youAnd all the snaggle tongues shall lick tonightSweet circular motionsAmplifier Buddah in her sightAnd love smiles through me.Yeah, I'll always be your friend.Oh yeah, at least just till the end
