Don't say if it's comingI don't wanna knowAnd neither should youSo don't sayDon't pray for forgivenessCos you'll still be sinning a whileDon't say that you're leaving meThis timeMay be it always be soThese nights in the tractorbeamWith the ship overhead and us in it's shadowAs I fire my laserbeam into your heartDon't blame anybodyThe enemy is hereAnd they look just like usThere's no blameDon't fear for the futureCause I'm scare enough for us bothDon't wish it were different, pleaseMay it always be soThese nights in the tractorbeamWith the ship overhead and us in it's shadowAs I fire my laserbeam into your heart
