It looked like the perfect dayIn photos we were smilingBut something was wrong in youInside you were sufferingLungs were barely movingI wanted to comfort you ohh noSo i said shhhhhhOh you'll fix all my cracked broken bonesAnd replace all my black poison bloodShe murders me with a smileStrangles me with her eyesI'm poisoned as she passes by ohhThe buildings around me shakeLike cheap plastic wedding cakesI fell to the ground with youOh you'll fix all my cracked broken bonesAnd replace all my black poison blood
