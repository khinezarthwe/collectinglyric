Somebody right above me gets up from her chairThe ceiling shakes when he makes his way down the stairsThe lights go out, put a finger to your mouthThere is nothing we can get away within this houseWould be so hardWould break your heartWould waste of timeI know it's a diamond mineAll our friends are doing fineAnd there's a dinner party right across the hallAnd I hear neighbors laughing through the kitchen wallAnd I hear the sound of a plate crash to the groundWhen I turn the table on its side it'll shake the houseWould be so hardWould break your heartWould waste your timeI know it's a diamond mineAll our friends are doing fineSo I won't ask againSomebody might bemoan me, screaming in these roomsYou keep your mouth shut if you know what is good for youThe lights go out, I can hear bad things aroundThere is nothing we can get away within this houseWould be so hardWill break your heartWill waste your timeI know it's a diamond mineAll our friends are doing fineSo I won't ask again
