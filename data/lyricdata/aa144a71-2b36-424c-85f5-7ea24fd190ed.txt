Her brow: pensiveHer knees: awayI stand beside herBut i look straight aheadAnd dissolveBefore the night began on Herring StreetA book from school kept me wanderingThis may take a whileI might never see this throughAnd they said that chapter four repeats itselfAlong with three so farWhere are you tonight?It's crowded at the sokol clubAnd tonight will be the sameI want her walk to scream her confidence above meI try to hide my thoughtsI stare blankly through her faceThis seems so senselessShe sees me breathingMy hands are crippled clayThis could have been differentI hear myself saying again again again
