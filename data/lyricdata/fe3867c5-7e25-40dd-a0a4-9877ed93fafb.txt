I've woken again in an ocean of saltDrenched from recurringDreams of such horrorThey haunt my eveningsNightmares of a future so absurdThis fantasy of events could never occurSuch vivid imagery has meBlurring all kinds of linesBetween here and realityBillboards have replaced all window panesFaith is less a feeling and more a mandateFed up are the sun and the moonThey're burning up and leaving soon, soon, soonMy twisted imaginationIt has a mind of its ownSo wake me from this dreamMy crooked precognitionIts distance from the truth growsPlease wake me from this dreamWhere there's an answer for everythingHiding behind child-proof plastic locksAnd under cotton swabsThere's a medicine for every illIf the money's rightThe pain can be drowned with a bitter pillAll the women are paper thinTheir necks barely hold up their headsBoys have been trainedAnd prepared since birthTo serve their roleAnd fight until their death, death, deathMy twisted imaginationIt has a mind of its ownSo wake me from this dreamMy crooked precognitionIts distance from the truth growsPlease wake me from this dreamMy twisted imaginationIt has a mind of its ownMy crooked precognitionIts distance from the truth growsPlease save me from this dreamIt's only a fabricationThis place is all in my headIt's only a fabricationThis place is all in my headI rub my eyes to findThis whole timeI thought I was in a slumberThey've been open wide
