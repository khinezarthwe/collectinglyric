And when we get home, I know we won't be home at allThis place we live, it is not where we belongAnd I miss who we were in the town that we could call our ownGoing back to get away after everything has changedCould you remind me of a time when we were so alive(Everything has changed)Do you remember that? Do you remember that?(Everything has changed)Could you help me push aside all that I have left behind(Everything has changed)Do you remember that? Do you remember that?So we stand here now and no one knows us at allI won't get used to thisI won't get used to being goneAnd going back won't feel the same if we aren't stayingGoing back to get away after everything has changedCould you remind me of a time when we were so alive(Everything has changed)Do you remember that? Do you remember that?(Everything has changed)Could you help me push aside all that I have left behind(Everything has changed)Do you remember that? Do you remember that?Taking up our timeTaking up our timeTaking up our timeIt's taking up our timeWe can't go back, we can't go back at allIt's taking up our timeWe can't go back, we can't go back at allIt's taking up our timeWe can't go back, we can't go back at allIt's taking up our time, taking up our timeCould you remind me of a time when we were so aliveDo you remember that? Do you remember that?
