If I never ever see you again,Would you take all that I said and believe it to be true?Would you choose to lose it all with no sense of consequence?Oh the kiss of death is only but a breath awayIt's only timeBefore you loseThe things that meantThe most to youYou're in denialYou're out of your mindYou'll be the one who dies aloneIf I could I would have moved on long ago,But you wanted me to stay so I let you have your wayIs it better to be friends or sever ties? well that dependsâ€¦.Oh the kiss of death is only but a breath awayIt's only timeBefore you loseThe things that meantThe most to youYou're in denialYou're out of your mindYou'll be the one who dies aloneWhen you just can't trust yourself more than anybody elseThe kiss of death is only but a breath awayIt's up to youIt's not down to meYou change your mind too easilyWhat's in your headIs not in your heartYou wait too long to play your cardsIt's only time,Before you loseThe things that meantThe most to youYou're in denialYou're out of your mindYou'll be the one dies aloneThe kiss of death is only but a breath away
