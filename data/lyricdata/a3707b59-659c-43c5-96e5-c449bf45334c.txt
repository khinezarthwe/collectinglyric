To stand the test of time to stand aloneTo be without the glueThat keeps us glued togetherAnd feeling so excrementalIt only goes to show youHow many ways you don't know youWhen the bad sets in, I could use some sleepResting, falling, falling deeper than deepWe miss the point to carry onwe miss the pointTo carry on whereThings you love but did not getAnd all the times you've been upset byUnfulfilled dreams and visionsand the guilt for your wrong decisionsIt's so hard to pry awayPry out from under all the liesAnd distractions of the worldYou've seen what they can doBut you can't see your way outWe miss the point to carry onAll things fall throughThat how it feels when you hear the sound of disappointmentSo unsatisfied when the sight's set higherSome can't achieveDon't believe there is light at the end at allThere is light at the end at allThere's no lightTime to reach out for what's realIt's easy to miss, insistThat you shouldn't always follow the first thing you feel
