June is on the run for so longPushed and pulled then shunned it was so wrongThese 4 walls crashing in won't stop me nowCos alive, I'm out tonight, all night.Everybody needs to know its the year of the ratEveryday we've got to hold onCos if we hold on we could find some new energyStreets with flags unfurled like treasureThank me for me for my words its a pleasureJust ask me to stay coz ill be goneBut it's alright, I'm okay, alwaysEverybody needs to know it's the year of the ratEvery day we've got to hold onCuz if we hold on we could find some new energyOne plus one is one togetherOne plus one is one foreverOne plus one is one togetherOne plus one is one foreverEverybody needs to know it's the year of the ratEverybody needs to know it's the year of the ratEverybody needs to know it's the year of the ratEverybody needs to know it's the year of the ratEveryday we've got to hold onCuz if we hold on we could find some new energy
