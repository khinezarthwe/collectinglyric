Sick of all that we have to be in this lifeGimme all that you haveGimme what you likeWaiting here for a fool to begin his lifeAnd you, you try to rememberFlipping coins from a tinTill he feels the nightAnd you, you try to rememberWe're part of aWe're part of aWe're part of a crazy worldGimme time to reflectGimme all we knowHolding hands on the streetWhere the lights are lowYou and me wanting moreBut we'll never knowAnd you, you try to rememberWhat it means in a worldWhere it's never slowAnd you, you try to rememberWe're part of aWe're part of aWe're part of a crazy worldGimme all that you haveGimme what you likeWaiting here for a fool to begin his lifeAnd you, you try to rememberFlipping coins from a tinTill he feels the nightAnd you, you try to rememberWe're part of aWe're part of aWe're part of a crazy world
