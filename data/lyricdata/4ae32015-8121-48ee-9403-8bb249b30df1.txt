Another night slips away.In other words I should saythere are no words he should say.There are no words.In his eyes I see the fearthat only time can disappear.If only time could reappear.Now's the time.Something to take it away.To take it away. To take it.Don't let it stay.Don't let it stay. Don't let it.The butterflies are passive/aggressiveand put their problems on the shelfbut they're beautiful.And he'll realize the only thing that's realare the kids that kid themselves, and the demiseof the beautiful.  What is beautiful?The multi-life is better thanthe one we're in - the one we knew.'Cause everyone is seeing througheveryone.They're stepping on his gold terrain.He's moving on with bold refrain.His blatantly old campaignIs moving on.Something to take it away.To take it away. To take it.Don't let it stay.Don't let it stay. Don't let it.The butterflies are passive/aggressiveand put their problems on the shelfbut they're so beautiful.He'll realize the only thing that's realare the kids that kid themselves, and the demiseof the beautiful.  What is beautiful?What can't stay goes away.What can't stay goes away.It starts stopping when it stops stoppingIt starts stopping when it stops stoppingIt starts stopping when it stops stoppingIt starts stopping when it stops stoppingIt starts stopping when it stops stoppingIt starts stopping when it stops stoppingIt starts stopping when it stops stoppingIt starts stopping when it stops stoppingIt starts stopping when it stops stoppingyeahahh yeahooooooo yeah yeah yeahooooooo yeah yeah yeahooooooo yeah yeah yeahooooooo yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah ooooooo
