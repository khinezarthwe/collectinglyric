I took my love, took it downI climbed a mountain and I turned aroundAnd I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills'Til the landslide brought me downOh, mirror in the sky, what is love?Can the child within my heart rise above?Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?Can I handle the seasons of my life?Mmm, hmm, mmmWell, I've been afraid of changing'Cause I've built my life around youBut time makes you bolder, even children get olderAnd I'm getting older tooWell, I've been afraid of changing'Cause I've built my life around youBut time makes you bolder, even children get olderAnd I'm getting older tooOh, I'm getting older tooOh, take my love, take it downOh, climb a mountain and turn aroundAnd if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hillsWell, the landslide will bring it downAnd if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hillsWell, the landslide will bring it downOh, oh, the landslide will bring you down
