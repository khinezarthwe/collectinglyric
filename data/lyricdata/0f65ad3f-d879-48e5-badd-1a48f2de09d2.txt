How I am strongIs to know what makes me weakHow I am foundIs to know just whom I seekThe gift of a blessingThe burden of a sinOh, turn, turn to himI wanna be readyI wanna be readyI wanna be readyReady to put on my long, white robeNailed acrossFrom hand to handFor the sinOf every woman and manAnd all upon his earthIs all within his planAnd I knowThis shall be my journey homeI wanna be readyI wanna be readyI wanna be readyReady to put on my long, white robeReadyI wanna be readyI wanna be readyReady to put on my long, white robeCovet no silverOh, covet no goldReach your emptyHands for him to holdUp in his kingdomGlory shall be proclaimedAh, sing the songAnd praise his nameI wanna be readyI wanna be readyI wanna be readyReady to put on my long, white robeReadyI want to be readyI wanna be readyReady to put on my long, white robeReadyI wanna be readyI wanna be readyReady to put on my long, white robe
