Remix!Tell me, tell me,Is life just a playground,Think you're the real deal honey,And some one will always look out for you.But wake up baby,You're so totally deluded,You'll end up old and lonely,If you don't get a bullet in your head,Good luck, good luck,Good luck in your new bed,Enjoy your nightmares honey,When your rest in your way.Remix!No more lies,Without you.Good good luck,In your new bed,Enjoy your nightmares,When you rest in your way,Good good luck,In your new bed,Enjoy your nightmares,Good luck, good luck,Good luck in your new bed.
