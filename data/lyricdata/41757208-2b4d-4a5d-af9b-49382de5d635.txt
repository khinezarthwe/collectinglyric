We've waited far to long to, watch it all crash and fall through,So when you feel like shit you gotta keep on pushing,If you saw the world through my eyes, then you wouldn't feel so high rise,Its time to take our chance you gotta sit back and hold tight.There's forces working in our heads but we don't understand them,I need a map to find my way out all the time,Theres curses lurking in our heads but we don't want to find them,We need to come back down and face what we've become.The more I think the more I wish I could push stop then hit rewind,What I would give to have a day back then when no one really cares,I remember when we all used to kick back take days off school,So many times I've smiled so many times I cried but never did we try,Never did we try, because.There's forces working in our heads but we don't understand them,I need a map to find my way out all the time,Theres curses lurking in our heads but we don't want to find them,We need to come back down and face what we've become.It's haunting me, I'm so alone,I'm just trying to find my way back home,I'm so alone, alone.There's forces working in our heads but we don't understand them,I need a map to find my way out all the time,Theres curses lurking in our heads but we don't want to find them,We need to come back down and face what we've become.
