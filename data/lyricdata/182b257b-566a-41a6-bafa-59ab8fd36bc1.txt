Only you can touch meWith your dark eyesWith a look that burns like fireThrough the lonely nightSometimes I runBut I can never hideFrom the pieces of my heartThat fall like rain from the skyWhen you hear the thunderWhen you hear the soundOf a mountain crashing downIt's just my heart in piecesWhen I feel the hungerWhen I'm reaching outWith a hundred thousand handsIt's my heart, heart in piecesNo one cuts through my soulLike you canI'm naked to the boneBeside your empty handI see your face and I rememberI'm a prisoner of your fateI'm a loser in the raceWhen you hear the thunderWhen you hear the soundOf a mountain crashing downIt's just my heart in piecesWhen I feel the hungerWhen I'm reaching outWith a hundred thousand handsIt's my heart, heart in piecesI walk the fine lineBetween fire and the iceThe memory lives onThere's always something to remind me(Always something)Every teardrop fallingWhen your voice keeps callingWhen you hear the thunderWhen you hear the soundOf a mountain crashing downIt's just my heart in piecesWhen I feel the hungerWhen I'm reaching outWith a hundred thousand handsIt's my heart, heart in pieces
