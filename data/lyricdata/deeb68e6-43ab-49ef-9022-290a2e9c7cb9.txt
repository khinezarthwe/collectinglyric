In space the stars are no nearerJust glitters like a morgueAnd I dreamed I was a spacemanBurned like a moth in a flameAnd our world was so fucking goneBut I'm not attached to your worldNothing heals, nothing grows (x2)'Cause it's a great big white worldAnd we are drained of our colorsWe used to love ourselvesWe used to love one anotherAll my stitches itchMy prescription's lowI wish you were queenJust for todayIn a world so white what else could I say?And hell was so coldAll the vases are so brokenAnd the roses tear our hands all openMother mary miscarryBut we pray just like insectsAnd the world is so ugly now'Cause it's a great big white worldAnd we are drained of our colorsWe used to love ourselvesWe used to love one anotherAll my stitches itchMy prescription's lowI wish you were queenJust for todayAll my stitches itchMy prescription's lowI wish you were queenJust for todayIn a world so white what else could I say?'Cause it's a great big white worldAnd we are drained of our colorsWe used to love ourselvesWe used to love one anotherAll my stitches itchMy prescription's lowI wish you were queenJust for today (x2)In a world so white what else could I say?
