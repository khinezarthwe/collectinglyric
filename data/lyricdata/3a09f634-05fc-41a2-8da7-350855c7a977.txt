A finger's touch upon my lipsIt's a morning yearningPull the courtains shut, try to keep it darkBut the sun is burningThe world awakens on the runAnd will soon be earningWith hopes of better days to comeIt's a morning yearningAnother day, another chance to get it rightMust I still be learningBaby crying kept us up all nightWith her morning yearningLike a summer rose, I'm a victim of the fallBut I'm soon returningYour love's the warmest place the sun ever shinesMy morning yearning
