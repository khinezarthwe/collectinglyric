There's no mistakeI smell that smellIt's that time of year againI can taste the airThe clocks go backRailway trackSomething blocks the line againAnd the train runs late for the first timeA pebble beachWe're underneathA pier just been painted redWhere I heard the news for the first timeAnd all the friends lay down the flowersSit on the banks and drink for hoursTalk of the way they saw him lastLocal boy in the photographHe'll always be 23Yet the train runs on and onPast the place they found his clothingThere's no mistakeI smell that smellIt's that time of year againI can taste the airThe clocks go backRailway trackSomething blocks the line againAnd the train runs late for the first time todayAnd all the friends lay down the flowersSit on the banks and drink for hoursTalk of the way they saw him lastLocal boy in the photograph... todayHe's gone away
