You were meant to be freezingOOOOOH!! Crystallized and you're sneezingNo one knowz or hearz what you sayGot to get you trapped under ice!You cannot run, you cannot hideCuz the ice securely holdz youWrapped up tight, can't move, break freeHand of Doom iz so fuckin' cold, ooooooh!OOOOOH!! Then I suddenly see youOOOOOH!! Did I tell you I'll freeze youEvery single day in the ice?Got to get you trapped under ice!
