How I love to be the chainHow I love to say your nameHow I wanna be the one you run toHow I wanna see this throughHow I love to be the riskAnd the wrinkles in your fistHow I love to be the one you needHow I love to watch it bleedWhen will you learn just to give meWhat I want, what I wantWhen will you learn to let it showHow I wanna be the eyeAs it watches in the skyHow I thought it was a reason callHow I love to risk it allHow I love to be the twistHow I wanna live through thisSwinging wildly from a hand you holdHow I love to be that boldWhen will you learn just to give meWhat I want, what I wantWhen will you learn to let it showWhat you didn't see cominWhen will you learn just to give meWhat I want, what I wantWhen will you learn to let it showWhen will you learn just to give meWhat I want, what I wantWhen will you learn to let it show
