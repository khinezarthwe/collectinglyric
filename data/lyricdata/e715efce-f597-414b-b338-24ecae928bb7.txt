Down to the earth I fellWith dripping wingsHeavy things won't flyAnd the sky might catch on fireAnd burn the axis of the world, that's whyI prefer a sunless skyTo the glittering and stinging in my eyesI feel so lightThis is all I wanna feel tonightI feel so lightTonight and the rest of my lifeGleaming in the dark seaI'm as light as airFloating there breathlesslyWhen the dream dissolves I openUp my eyes, I realize thatEverything is shoreless seaA weightlessness is passing over meI feel so lightThis is all I wanna feel tonightI feel so lightTonight and the rest of my lifeTonight and the rest of my lifeEverything is waves and starsThe universe is resting in my armsI feel so lightThis is all I wanna feel tonightI feel so lightTonight and the rest of my lifeI feel so lightThis is all I wanna feel tonightI feel so lightTonight and the rest of my lifeTonight and the rest of my life
