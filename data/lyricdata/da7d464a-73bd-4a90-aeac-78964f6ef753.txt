I feel like hell, I've caught the sickness once again.And I don't feel right!I ain't gettin' up. Think I'm slippin' away.I wanna soar like the prophets beforeAddicted to the turbulence.Sucked in under false pretenseI wanna say what needs to be said.Addicted to the turbulence, feel the past come rushin' in.These palms don't lie I can't focus, when the statics onRoutines I hide don't mind killing this secrets mine.I wanna soar like the prophets beforeAddicted to the turbulence.Sucked in under false pretenseI wanna say what needs to be said.Addicted to the turbulence, feel the past come rushin' in.Got to stop myself I can't take this!When I fall the clouds won't cradle.Oh how tempting they are, make you feel like you have it all.DRIVE ME MAD A FULL ON RAMPAGE!THE OLDER I AM THE LESS FEELING I HAVE!Without the gospel losing the truth. I'm losing the truth.Gotta stop myself I can't take this!THE OLDER I AM THE LESS FEELING I HAVE!Without the gospel losing the truth. I'm losing the truth.
