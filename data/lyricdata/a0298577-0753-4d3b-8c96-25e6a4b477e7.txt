I can stand althoughMy bones are breakingProp me up and seeMy soul is achingTake the dirt uponThe ground around meBury me inside the graveI built for you Walk into the roomFeel my stare of doomScars that line my faceLies cannot replaceI can see through youAnd I'll tell youAll my lifeI've heard a thousand liesSeen myself throughSomeone else's eyesKill you with my wordsGet what you deserveI can see through youAnd I'll tell youAll my lifeI've heard a thousand liesSeen myself throughSomeone else's eyesRemember what you did to me?For you know I won't forgetNow you've broken everythingIs your heart filled with regret?All my lifeI've heard a thousand liesSeen myself throughSomeone else's eyesAll my lifeI've heard a thousand liesSeen myself throughSomeone else's eyesRemember what you did to me?For you know I won't forget
