Here we standWorlds apart, hearts broken in two, two, twoSleepless nightsLosing ground, I'm reaching for you, you, youFeeling that it's goneCan change your mindIf we can't go onTo survive the tide love dividesSomeday, love will find youBreak those chains that bind youOne night will remind youHow we touched and went our separate waysIf he ever hurts youTrue love won't desert youYou know I still love youThough we touched and went our separate waysTroubled timesCaught between confusion and pain, pain, painDistant eyesPromises we made were in vain, in vain, in vainIf you must go, I wish you loveYou'll never walk aloneTake care, my loveMiss you, loveSomeday, love will find youBreak those chains that bind youOne night will remind youHow we touched and went our separate waysIf he ever hurts youTrue love won't desert youYou know I still love youThough we touched and went our separate waysOhSomeday, love will find youBreak those chains that bind youOne night will remind youIf he ever hurts youTrue love won't desert youYou know I still love youI still love you, girlI really love you, girlAnd if he ever hurts youTrue love won't desert youNoNo
