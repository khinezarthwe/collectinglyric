Your honey smell makes me sickYour lies are spreading so thickPins in your photo I stickYour lovers all gather roundThey clap and cheer at your soundIm all but lost in the crowdYou dont need me to surviveToo busy ruling your hiveYou barely know im aliveYou're a stranger when we kissAnd if I cease to existJust cross me off your listJust one sip of your behaviour and my senses tell me dangerim getting sick of your shit
