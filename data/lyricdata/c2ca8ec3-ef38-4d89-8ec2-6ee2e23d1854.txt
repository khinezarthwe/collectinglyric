In my hour of needHa! No, you're not thereAnd though I reached out for youWouldn't lend a handThrough the darkest hourGrace didn't shine on meIt feels so coldVery cold, no one cares for meDid you ever think I get lonely?Did you ever think that I needed loveÂ ?Did you ever think to stop thinking?You're the only one that I'm thinking ofYou'll never knowHow hard I triedTo find my space and satisfy you tooThings will be betterWhen I'm dead and goneDon't try to understandKnowing youI'm probably wrongBut, ohHow I lived my life for youStill you'd turn awayNowAs I die for youMy flesh still crawls as I breathe your nameAll these yearsI thought I was wrongNow I know it was youRaise your headRaise your faceYour eyes, tell me who you think you are?I walkI walk aloneInto the promised landThere's a better place for meBut it's far, far awayEverlasting life for meIn a perfect worldBut I gotta die firstPlease god send me on my wayTime has a way of taking timeLoneliness is not only felt by foolsAlone I call to ease the painYearning to be held by you, aloneSo alone, I'm lost consumed by the painThe painThe painThe painWon't you hold me again?And you just laughed, ha-ha! Bitch!My whole life is work built on the pastBut the time has come when allThings shall passThis good thing passed away
