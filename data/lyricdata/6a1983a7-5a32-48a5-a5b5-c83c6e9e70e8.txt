There are those who live their lifeAs if there is no otherSo they burn their bridges but they couldn'tCare any lessComes a time that catches upThey pay no matter, pack their bagsAnd take off to another place to startFrom scratchThey never get attachedGrowing up was wall-to-wall excitementBut I don't recall another who couldUnderstand at allAnd I didn't try to find what I just had to fallFall outIt's alright, I've had it up to here with everyoneAnd so I'll sayThat there's nothing left to make me want to stayThere are those who live their lifeAfraid of consequencesSo they learn to sit on fencesAnd they can't step on toesMy heart goes out to thoseThey're right under my noseGrowing up was pretty dullI often times exaggerateThe ones I hate that ICould never saveAnd I realize of courseThat there will come a dayThat I will sayThat there's nothing left to make me want to stayBut I can never go awayThat there's nothing left to make me want to stayAnd I will never go awayAnd there's nothing left to make me want to stay
