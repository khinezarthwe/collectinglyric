I know he knocks you off your feetYou're so bitter; you think he's sweetWell he's wrong for you, I swearDid you forget to read the script?There was never a role for himIt was always you and me, just mePopular mechanics for broken hearts could help me nowI know you never felt romanceAnd we always lack suspenseI can edit those parts outI never made you feel completeI would fall beneath your feetI would never bring you down, so downPopular mechanics for broken hearts could help me nowJust because he loves you tooHe would never take a bullet for youDon't believe a word he saysHe would never cut his heart out for youI heard he wrote you a songBut so whatSome guy wrote 69And one just ain't enoughAnd there's so sense in tryingI know 'cause I've beenTrying all the time to find something that would make you mineBut all I ever find my loveAre cliches that don't rhymePopular mechanics for broken hearts could help me nowJust because he loves you tooHe would never take a bullet for youDon't believe a word he saysHe would never cut his heart out for you
