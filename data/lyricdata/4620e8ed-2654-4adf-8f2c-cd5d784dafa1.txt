There was a timeWhen I was foolish enough to believe I could read your mindLike if I looked deep enough in your eyes I could see behindThe haze of your thoughtsTo try and findYour true self, divineBut these days,When we gotta take back every other thing that we say'Cause the fightin', the fussin', the cussin' is so easyWhen the trust is goneAnd you really don't believe meWhen I say I'm leavingI'm already goneI'm already goneAnd as far as we have comeIt still feels like you're the oneWho's precious to youYou're still more precious to youAnd the remnants of your loveIt won't let me see the SunDo you knowDo you knowWhat you have doneTo me?I try to put you behind meBut all I can do is write songs that remind meOf the fact that I'll never give away what's inside meSo when she tries to hold me'Cause she wants to console meShe'll never see the old meI'm already goneI'm already goneAnd as far as we have comeIt still feels like you're the oneWho's precious to youYou're still more precious to youAnd the remnants of your loveIt won't let me see the SunDo you knowDo you knowWhat you have doneAnd as far as we have comeIt still feels like you're the oneWho's precious to youYou're still more precious to youAnd the remnants of your loveIt won't let me see the SunDo you knowDo you knowWhat you have doneTo me?I'm already goneI'm already goneI'm already gone
