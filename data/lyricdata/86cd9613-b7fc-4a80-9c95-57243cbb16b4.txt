I got the fucked up bluesI got the fucked up bluesLord what can you doAbout the fuckin' fucked up bluesWell the beans have been bakin'Upon the camel's humpLike a voodoo curse in an old lady's purseConfetti on my graveI got the fucked up bluesI got the fucked up bluesLord what can you doAbout the fuckin' fucked up bluesI got the fucked up bluesI got the fucked up bluesLord what can you doAbout the fuckin' fucked up bluesI woke up on the futonAnd my boots were on fire
