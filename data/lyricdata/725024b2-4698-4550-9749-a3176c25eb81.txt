Lying beside you here in the darkFeeling your heart beat with mineSoftly you whisper, "You're so sincere"How could our love be so blind?We sailed on togetherWe drifted apartAnd here you are by my sideSo now I come to you with open armsNothing to hide, believe what I saySo here I am with open armsHoping you'll see what your love means to meOpen armsLiving without youLiving aloneThis empty house seems so coldWanting to hold youWanting you nearHow much I wanted you homeBut now that you've come backTurned night into dayI need you to staySo now I come to you with open armsNothing to hide, believe what I saySo here I am with open armsHoping you'll see what your love means to meOpen arms
