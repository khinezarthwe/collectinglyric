Why's it so strange when they say that the world's movin' upwards?Why's it surreal when my hands feel they can't roll the dice?Why's it so great just to wake every day alive and by your side?It's a mystery, I guessThere's lots of things that I can't findNot the way that you lookBut your move that catches my eyeWhy's it so soft when the cannons unload on the others?Why are we so loud when we say it won't happen to us?Why does my mind blow to bits every time they play that song?It's just the way that he singsNot the words that he says or the bandI'm in love with this soulIt's a meaning that I understand
