Running around,stop fussing you,Everybody's talking,nobody's walking,Hanging around and around,So come on, come onCome on, come onI don't know if I'm going out,I don't care much for hanging about,Beautiful girls walking down the street,But I don't care cause none of them gonna meet me,Come on, Come onCome on, Come onTonight at nine, I'm gonna sort it out,Running through this jungle with a stick in my hand,I'm gonna beat it about,All i want to do,I gotta whip it out,Well i'll be shaking out the shadows 'bout a quarter to four,You'll see me snaking like a cheater till I'm back at your door,Come on, Come on, Come on, Come on, Come on, Come on, Come on
