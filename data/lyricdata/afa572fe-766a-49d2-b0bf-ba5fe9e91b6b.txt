Just one more momentThat's all that's neededLike wounded soldiersIn need of healingTime to be honestThis time I'm pleadingPlease don't dwell on it'Cause I didn't mean itI can't believe I saidI'd lay our love on the groundBut it doesn't matter 'causeI made it up forgive me nowEvery day I spend awayMy soul's inside outGotta be some wayThat I can make it upTo you now, somehowBy now you know thatI'd come for youNo one but youYes I'd come for youBut only if you told me toI'd fight for youI'd lie it's trueGive my life for youYou know I'll always come for youI was blindfoldedBut now I'm seeingMy mind was closingNow I'm believingI finally know just what it meansTo let someone inTo see the side of meThat no one does, or ever willSo if you're ever lost andFind yourself all aloneI'd search foreverJust to bring you homeHere and nowThis I vowBy now you know thatI'd come for youNo one but youYes I'd come for youBut only if you told me toI'd fight for youI'd lie it's trueGive my life for youYou know I'll always come for youYou know I'll always come for youNo matter what gets in my wayAs long as there's still life in meNo matter what, rememberYou know I'll always come for youYes I'd come for youNo one but youYes I'd come for you (echo "for you" 2x)But only if you told me toAnd I'd fight for youI'd lie it's trueGive my life for youYou know I'll always come for youNo matter what gets in my wayAs long as there's still life in meNo matter what, rememberYou know I'll always come for youI'd crawl across this world for youDo anything you want me toNo matter what, rememberYou know I'll always come for youYou know I'll always come for you
