Today I'm leavingThis bullshit one-horse townFull of Cowboys and IndiansWho only have balls when there's a camera aroundWhere the girls they move to youWhen money gets thrown aroundEven happiness is using youMaybe you'll figure that outMaybe you'll figure that outMaybe you'll figure that outIt's a long way downYou know it's a damn shame the sun don't shine undergroundMaybe that's where it's beenMaybe that's where I've beenMaybe that's where it's beenA long way downSo today I'm leavingThis bullshit circus townDo you ever get the feelingThere ain't no hole when you're not around?Where the world it moves to youWhen the money gets spread aroundEven happiness is using youMaybe you'll figure that outMaybe you'll figure that outIt's a long way downYou know it's a damn shame the sun don't shine undergroundMaybe that's where it's beenMaybe that's where I've beenMaybe that's where it's beenA long way downLong way downLong way down
