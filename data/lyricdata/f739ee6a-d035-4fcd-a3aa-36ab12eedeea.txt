A New DecadeThe radio plays the sounds we madeAnd everything seems to feel just rightComing through your lonely mindWell I've seen thingsThat scarred and bruised and left me blindSo come on, listen along with meI think you need a little companyAnd how long will I run for?Who am I running from?And it makes senseThe youth coming up and making you dance'Cause I've got something inside of meSo come on, I could use the companyAnd how long will I run for?Who am I running from?But now I've seen my face in a cardboard wallNobody comes, nobody callsHow long will I run for?Who am I running from?And teenage tears sting my eyeballsIn a town where I wasn't bornAnd I will never sufferSo come on, come on, come onBut now I see my face in a cardboard wallNobody comes, nobody callsIf you're looking for meI'm there and it's youIf you're looking for meI'm there and it's trueIf you're looking for meI'll be looking for youIf you're looking for meThen I'm looking for youIf you're looking for meThen I'm looking for youIf you're looking for meThen I'm looking for you
