All the notebooks in the world can never hold the lives I holdBut I've gotta make them realIt's like covering a bird in solid steelAll of these thoughts that I concealThrough silenceAll the hearts in this red world can never hold the love I holdBut I'm throwing it awayIt's like swimming in oceans made of claySwimming in circles 'round the baySo blindlyWell feed me out to the lionsMy hearts a lionFeed me out to the lionswell I make excuses pass the buckI play the crowd but it's down to me not luckWhen the lights are onThe dreaming clouds they're living inThey try to hide their master fearBut their tears they catch on fireAnd as they drop they dance with my desireDon't think a plane could get much higher(plane could get much higher)Higher than I doJust on imagination, just on hopeJust on the thought that you will someday have a faceGive me a beat and real soundMaybe some feet will reach cold groundTo find youWell feed me out to the lionsIf I say this one more timeFeed me out to the lionsI beg, I hope, I wish, I prayBut that's not gonna send me on my wayWhen the lights come on
