Close your eyes, make me last foreverHold inside, immortal mineClose my eyes, lay me down in heavenEmbrace my lie, your soul in timeWon't you take me up inside youAm I more than you can takeI'll be your father's heart of darknessWhen you wakeBlack blood is pounding drive yourHeart through my stakeSlide up inside you till yourHearts start to breakWon't you take me up inside youAm I more than you can takeHide me deep inside and let meBe the one forsakenWon't you take me up inside youCause there's no more I can waitHold me in your eyes until there'sNo more of you that I can takeIs it taste of bloody kissesIs it more than you can fakeFeel me deep inside youIs it your faith that I shakeForgive me father for yourSins that I breakMy hand to the promise landYour soul that I preyWon't you take me up inside youAm I more than you can takeHide me deep inside and let meBe the one forsakenWon't you take me up inside youCause there's no more I can waitHold me in your eyes until there'sNo more of you that I can takeWon't you take me up inside youAm I more than you can takeHide me deep inside and let meBe the one forsakenWon't you take me up inside youCause there's no more I can waitHold me in your eyes until there'sNo more of you that I can takeTake, take, takeNo more of you that I can take
