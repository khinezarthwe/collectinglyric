Hey honey what you trying to sayAs I stand hereDon't you walk awayAnd the world comes tumbling downHand in hand in a violent lifeMaking love on the edge of a knifeAnd the world comes tumbling downAnd it's hard for me to sayAnd it's hard for me to stayI'm going down to be by myselfI'm going back for the good of my healthAnd there's one thing I couldn't doSacrifice myself to youSacrificeBaby baby I just can't seeJust what you mean to meI take my aim and I fake my wordsI'm just your long time curseAnd if you walk awayI can't take itBut that's the way that you areAnd that's the things that you sayBut now you've gone too farWith all the things you sayGet back to where you come fromI can't help itUnder the April skiesUnder the April skyUnder the April sunUnder the April skyUnder the April sunUnder the April sunUnder the April skyUnder the April sunUnder the April skySun grows coldSky gets black and you broke me upAnd now you won't come backShaking hand, life is deadAnd a broken heartAnd a screaming headUnder the April skyUnder the April sunUnder the April skyUnder the April skies
