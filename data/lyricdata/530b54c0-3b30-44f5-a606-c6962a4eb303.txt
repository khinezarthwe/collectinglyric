Nobody on the roadNobody on the beachI feel it in the airThe summer's out of reachEmpty lake, empty streetsThe sun goes down aloneI'm drivin' by your houseThough I know you're not at homeI can see youYour brown skin shinin' in the sunYou got your hair combed back and your sunglasses on, babyAnd I can tell you my love for you will still be strongAfter the boys of summer have goneI never will forget those nightsI wonder if it was a dreamRemember how you made me crazy?Remember how I made you scream?I don't understand what happened to our loveBut baby when I get you backI'm gonna show you what I'm made ofI can see youYour brown skin shinin' in the sunI see you walkin' real slow and you're smilin' at everyoneI can tell you my love for you will still be strongAfter the boys of summer have goneOut on the road todayI saw a BLACK FLAG sticker on a CadillacA little voice inside my head said, "Don't look back, You can never look back."I thought I knew what love wasWhat did I know?Those days are gone foreverI should just let them go butI can see youYour brown skin shinin' in the sunYou got that top pulled down and that radio on, babyAnd I can tell you my love for you will still be strongAfter the boys of summer have goneI can see youYour brown skin shinin' in the sunYou got that hair slicked back and those Wayfarers on, babyI can tell you my love for you will still be strongAfter the boys of summer have gone
