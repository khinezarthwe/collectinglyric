Talking to the songbird yesterdayFlew me to a place not far awayShe's a little pilot in my mindSingin' songs of love to pass the timeGonna write a song so she can seeGive her all the love she gives to meTalk of better days that have yet to comeI never felt this love from anyoneShe's not anyoneShe's not anyoneShe's not anyoneA man can never dream these kind of thingsEspecially when she came and spread her wingsWhispered in my ear the things I'd likeThen she flew away into the nightGonna write a song so she can seeGive her all the love she gives to meTalk of better days that have yet to comeNever felt this love from anyoneShe's not anyoneShe's not anyoneShe's not anyone
