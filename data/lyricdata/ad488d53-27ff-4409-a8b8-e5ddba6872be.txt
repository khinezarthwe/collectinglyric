Under the sky, the cold morning light,I called out your name.With nothing I could feelNothing I knew was realI called out your nameVision a blur, voice in a slur, crying in the rainOne thing I knew, baby it was you.I called out your name.I was dreamin of a place where my body never aged,I called out your name.I was dreamin of a time when I never lost my mind,I called out your name.My vision turned the threat, I woke up in a sweat,feeling my spirits drain!One thing I knew baby it was you.I called out your name.I was feelin so old, my body so cold,Only you I needed to see.I had fallen so low, you were all I had knownI had to love before I had to leave!Under the sky, the cold morning lightI called out your name.With nothing I could feel,Nothing I knew was real,I called out your name.My time was running out!Still I had to shout, I held my refrain! Whoa!One thing I knew, baby it was you!I called out your name.
