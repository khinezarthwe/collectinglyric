My own intent's not easy to seeI'm not the great communicator that I used to be, apparentlyBut I know what it means when I hear screamsAnd it's the sonics, not the phonics and it's all in the deliveryNow I'm learning 'bout what lies underneathSo if you catch me speaking through my teethOh, you gotta stop me nowI keep my ear to the streetAnd I keep on reading lips and looks as I'm looking for that perfect beatBut I know it's all down to meAnd if something's lost in the translation, I know I shouldn't take it so personallyBut your s's look like f's to meWe been ebonic since we been thirteenHow you like me now?They get detached from what's been going onThey feed you crap you can't keep growing onThey give you stats that tell you nothing at all'Bout who you want to beBut your s's look like f's to meWe been ebonic since we been thirteenHow you like me now?They get detached from what's been going onThey feed you crap you can't keep growing onThey give you stats that tell you nothing at all'Bout who you want to beWho you wanna be?
