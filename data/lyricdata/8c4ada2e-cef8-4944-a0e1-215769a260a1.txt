Me and Mean Gene's got a beautiful voicehe carries me home on his beautiful horse.Where she waits, I will ride ride rideC'mon stranger just sing me a songAnd if it's sad, I'll sing along long longI told you I knew every wordWhen I get to California,Gonna write my name in the sandI'm gonna lay this body downand watch the waves roll inand when the city spreads outjust like a cut veinEverybody drowns, sad and lonelywell everybody drowns, sad and lonelywell everybody drowns, sad and lonely, alrightSweet dreams and color and soundHighways in the fog waiting to be foundI'll start gold mines in the sky sky skyThey were clouds just waiting to cryAnd with the windI'm dancing drift drift driftin the shapes of the place that I missWhen I get to California,Gonna write my name in the sandI'm gonna lay this body downand watch the waves roll inI'm gonna rest this weary headon someone who I think will careWhen the stars and the sky start fallingI think you'll understandThat the city spreads outjust like a cut veinEverybody drowns, sad and lonelywell everybody drowns, sad and lonelywell everybody drowns, sad and lonely, alrightYeah I'm waiting for something to giveWell I'm waiting, I hope it's not meYeah I'm waiting...
