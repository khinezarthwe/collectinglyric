Ladies and gentlemen,We are gathered here todayIn rememberance of innocence lostWhat are you in this day and age, in this society,Without your cash, without your scrilla,I want you to take a second right now and ponder that,While i sing my song.....So what is it that keeps shorty on the avenue schemin'Half foot rolled back with nothin to believe in[wow, this is gonna take ages...Â :) ]
