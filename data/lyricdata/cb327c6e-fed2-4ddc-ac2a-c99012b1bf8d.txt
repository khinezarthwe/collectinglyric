Sound is ripping through your earsThe deafening sound of metal nearsYour body's waiting for his whipsThe taste of leather on your lipsHear the cry of war, louder than beforeWith his sword in hand to control the landCrushing metal strikes on this frightening nightFall onto your knees for the phantom lordVictims falling under chainsYou hear them crying death painsThe fists of terrors breaking throughNow there's nothing you can doHear the cry of war, louder than beforeWith his sword in hand to control the landCrushing metal strikes on this frightening nightFall onto your knees for the phantom lordThe leather armies have prevailedThe phantom lord has never failedSmoke is lifting from the groundThe rising volume metal soundHear the cry of war, louder than beforeWith his sword in hand to control the landCrushing metal strikes on this frightening nightFall onto your knees for the phantom lordFall to your knees and bow to the phantom lord
