There's a light bulb dangling from stringIt's slowly swaying up over my head nowAs I jot down the words that'll never be sungAnd wait for my headache to numbAnd the wind sounds as if the world's sighingAnd the moon's just a torn fingernailAs the TV flickers and hums by the wallAnd I wait for my eyesight to fadeSo, So, SoIt's so damn slowSo, So, SoIt's so damn slowAnd the bright-eyed choke on ambitionAnd the old folks circle their gravesAnd the young ones are busy destroying their namesAnd you're still just wasting away.I sit and watch the screen for a messageSome kinda sign that says we're OKBut the screen stays blank till I turn the thing offAnd wait for my conscience to break.So, So, SoIt's so damn slowSo, So, SoIt's so damn slowI hope you're learning to listenAnd I hope you're learning to stayAnd I hope you find what you're missingAnd I hope that you're making you're wayI'm a headcase if I don't keep movingAnd my head hurts if I don't sit stillIt's an itch that I'll never stop scratchingIt's a hole that I'll never quite fillSo
