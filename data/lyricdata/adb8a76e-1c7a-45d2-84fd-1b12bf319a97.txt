Turn awayIf you could get me a drink of water'Cause my lips are chapped and fadedCall my Aunt MarieHelp her gather all my thingsAnd bury me in all my favorite colorsMy sisters and my brothers, stillI will not kiss you'Cause the hardest part of thisIs leaving youNow turn away'Cause I'm awful just to see'Cause all my hair's abandoned all my bodyOh, my agonyKnow that I will never marryBaby, I'm just soggy from the chemoBut counting down the days to goIt just ain't livingAnd I just hope you knowThat if you say(If you say)Goodbye today(Goodbye today)I'd ask you to be true('Cause I'd ask you to be true)'Cause the hardest part of thisIs leaving you'Cause the hardest part of thisIs leaving you
