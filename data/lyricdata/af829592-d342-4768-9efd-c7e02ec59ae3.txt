Did your parents ever tell you to stay away from rock and rollDon't you ever tell them we're more than a million strongTaking your life stealing your souldon't ya know it won't be longAttacked by forces blown to the groundwe're an army like soldiers more than a million strongWe'll tear this place down with your sadistic powerGet mean to the forces of wrongBreak down the walls, feel the curseDon't ya know it won't be longStand up and fightStand up and fight for the metal in your bloodGet mean to the forces of wrongSounds of raging thunder metal lustDon't you know it won't be long
