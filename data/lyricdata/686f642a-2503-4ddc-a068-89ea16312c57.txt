I am a mechanical man, a mechanical manAnd I do the best I canBecause I have my FamilyI am a mechanical boyI am my mother's toyAnd I play in the backyard sometimesI am a mechanical boyIt's an illusionPostulated, mocked upThrough confusionConfusion, it's an illusionUtter confusionLive on in your illusionThat won't wear outI had a little monkeyAnd I sent him to the countryAnd I fed him ginger breadAlong came a choo chooAnd knocked my monkey koo kooAnd now my monkey's deadYou're so mechanical and you go and lay downAnd I wonder howA brown cow could say...
