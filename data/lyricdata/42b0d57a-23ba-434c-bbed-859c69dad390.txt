Can you hear meHear me screamin'Breaking in the muted skiesThis thunder heartLike bombs beatingEchoing a thousand milesMine is yours and yours is mineThere is no divideIn your honorI would die tonightMine is yours and yours is mineI will sacrificeIn your honorI would die tonightFor you to feel aliveCan you feel meFeel me breathingOne last breath before I close my eyesThis sufferingFor receivingDeliver me into the other sideMine is yours and yours is mineThere is no divideIn your honorI would die tonightMine is yours and yours is mineI will sacrificeIn your honorI would die tonightFor you to feel aliveFor you to feel aliveFor you to feel aliveFor you to feel alive
