Something's familiar to meThey don't have to knowSwift and contained and caught up in life so you never can landYour genius/beauty it hits me like dirt in the face and you can't understandAll I have ever wanted was just to be able to stand on my ownYou save all your problems for me, they don't have to knowWe can hide in the hilltops and graves, they don't have to knowYou come here on your own with cancers and perfumeAnd five o'clock in the afternoon is heaven and endlessCursed and betrayed and forced to be strong on these hard iron wingsWizards and scientists left on their own shouldn't play with these thingsNow we are running away and who knows what the future will bring, on our ownWe are left to survive on our own.And the mausoleums perched so high above the city can be fun in the right amount of sunAnd a certain amount of technology has pricked your curiosityAnd a certain amount of persecution has curiously invaded your mindAnd I tried to be the hero but I screwed it all up in the endAnd now we're in the midst of this whole great global warWhen five o'clock in the afternoon is heaven and endlessThey won't come here for meI covered up everything so carefullyThey got exactly what they deservedAll I get is this guiltI have sacrificed everything and now I am cursed by these iron wingsBut at least I am not aloneWhile I watch the city burn belowSomething's familiar to meThey don't have to know
