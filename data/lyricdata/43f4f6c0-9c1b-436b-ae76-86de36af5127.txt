Life means nothing, when no one knows your name,I never had too much but I'd give it all for fame,Baby, baby...She's there on the TV, So beautiful on screen,Selling me a life I've never known and never seen,Baby, baby...If I only had you, If I only had...(CHORUS:)Television, New religion, Let everyone sing Hallelujah.Politicians, Don't wanna listen, They only wanna make money out of you.Hallelujah!!Newspaper headlines, I can't believe my eyes,No tales of war and destruction, But who said what last night,On the TV, well that could be me!Through the shop window it's a wide screen world,But I can't afford a thing and I never get the girl,It ain't easy, no it ain't easy...If I only had you, If I only had you..If I only had you, If I only had...(CHORUS)Oh, You know we always want something,But somehow we end up with nothing, nothingIf I only had you, If I only had you..If I only had, If I only had...(CHORUS)
