In a river the colour of leadImmerse a baby's headWrap her up in the News Of The WorldDump her on a doorstep, girlThis night has opened my eyesAnd I will never sleep againYou kicked and cried like a bullied childA grown man of twenty-fiveOh, he said he'd cure your illsBut he didn't and he never willOh, save your lifeBecause you've only got oneThe dream has goneBut the baby is realOh, you did a good thingShe could have been a poetOr she could have been a foolOh, you did a bad thingAnd I'm not happyAnd I'm not sadA shoeless child on a swingReminds you of your own againShe took away your troublesOh, but then againShe left painSo please, save your lifeBecause you've only got oneThe dream has goneBut the baby is realOh, you did a good thingShe could have been a poetOr she could have been a foolOh, you did a bad thingAnd I'm not happyAnd I'm not sadAnd I'm not happyAnd I'm not sadAnd I'm not happyAnd I'm not sad
