Winter Calls when I'm alone and at the end of the dayLike any fool who'd been the owner to a pretty faceNow time it separates us to a different placeI'd be alright if I could only stop thinkingAnd if I'm happy cause you say you are I'd be lyingAnd if I said I was a man that don't need anyone at allThen I know I was wrongBut don't leave me out in the coldFoolishly shaking my bonesIf you don't want my heart let me knowI get lonely when winter callsWinter calls the start of june until the end of MayCause any rule I've ever had I've always had to breakI find I sit around trying to compensateI feel alright at times but only when I'm drinkingAnd yes it hurts to know that I am not your obligationBut I don't want to spend a lifetime waiting...And if I'm happy cause you say you are I'd be lyingAnd every time I close my eyes I'm hearing warning sirenesThe thought of you in someone else's arms and I feel violentAnd if I said I was a man then maybe I was fool...
