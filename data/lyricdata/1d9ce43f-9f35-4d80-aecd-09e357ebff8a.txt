If only I had one more chanceTo change my life todayThen I would never let you goAll my friends keep telling meThat I should leave you for a whileSo you must show your love to meAnd tell me what you feelI thought that even you had feelings for me tooI know I was wrongAnd baby when you care, then I will be thereBy your sideAnd now I stand here alone in the darkWithout youThere's nothing more that I would likeThan be with youI close my eyes but I can't stopThinking of youAnd now I stand here alone in the darkWithout you
