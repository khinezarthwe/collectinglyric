Warn your warmth to turn awayHere it's December every dayPress your lips to the sculptures and surely you'll stayLove like winter, for of sugar and ice I am made, I am madeIt's in the blood, it's in the bloodI met my love before I was bornHe wanted love, I taste of bloodHe bit my lip and drank my warmth from years beforeShe exhales vanilla laceI barely dreamt her yesterday, yesterdayRead the lines in the mirror through the lipstick tracePor siempre, she said "it seems you're somewhere far away" to his faceIt's in the blood, it's in the bloodI met my love before I was bornShe wanted love, I taste of bloodShe bit my lip and drank my warmth from years beforeLove like winterIt's in the blood, it's in the bloodI met my love before I was bornHe wanted love, I taste of bloodHe bit my lip and drank my warmth from years before
