What was yours to giveWas also yours to sellThere's the haystackCan you spin it into gold?Halo on your headA tail and cloven hoofYou set sail upon a sea of open walletAnd when you're played outYou'll coast for milesFueled by smilesYou run in circlesWith industry professionalsYou climb the ladderThat leads you to the temple gatesThe evil god there will welcome you with open armsWhat was yours to giveWas also yours to sellBut where's the haystack now?And where's the pot of gold?
