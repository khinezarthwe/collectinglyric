Listen to meWhen I sayBeautiful timeIs fading awayWhen will I wakeFrom this dream?It's a never-ending painful sceneI rise up when I drownThe water is thickerI rise up when I drownAnd swim to the surfaceThinking of youBrings me downHow could you pull the plugAnd replace me with someone else?I rise up when I drownThe water is thickerI rise up when I drownAnd swim to the surfaceHave you ever wondered about me?Did you lose your feelings?Or forget what my name is?Have you ever wondered?Well, have you?I rise up when I drownThe water is thickerI rise up when I drownAnd swim to the surfaceI rise up when I drown
