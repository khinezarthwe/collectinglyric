Keep away from me nowI know how to kill myselfLive behind the iron wallThat you've built around yourselfMy dismay was completeWhen you wrote your master planNow I live filled with hateThat I hold within my handThank you for doing this to meI'd never know it for myselfThank you for doing this to meI'd never find out for myselfTake the hate in me nowFill it up within your veinsMind the stray thoughts of lifeThey grow dimmer every dayThank you for doing this to meI'd never know it for myselfThank you for doing this to meI'd never find out for myselfThank you for doing this to meI'd never know it for myselfThank you for doing this to meI'd never find out for myself
