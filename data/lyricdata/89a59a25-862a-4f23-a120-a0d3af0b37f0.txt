You fight meFlat on my lonely face I fellFinding in the end I live wellIn the light of the life that I have foundIt's coming downI don't know what isn't realBut it's easy to beat meSuck it inLife is sink or swimLove is blindingNo survivingI don't know what I want to be yetBut I can show that I need to see thisNo time for lies and empty fightsI'm on your sideCan't we live a life of peace and happiness?I don't think soNo denying that I'm scared to lose the things I loveI'm in controlThis is howThis is how it's gonna endThis is howThis is how it's gonna endEndEveryone is waiting hereFor everyoneLeave me aloneThis is howThis is how it's gonna endThis is howThis is how it's gonna endThis is howThis is how it's gonna endNOThis is howThis is how it's gonna endEnd
