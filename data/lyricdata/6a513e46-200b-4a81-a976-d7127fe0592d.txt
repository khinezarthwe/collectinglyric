Everything's a mess I sleep but don't undressdrinking all but the Tia MariaI never finished any of thosebooks hanging open like house plantsBegging for water and a little readingHolding that one big idea I'm needingI know what I don't wantI really know what I don't wantI don't really really know what I want, do I?Another black shirt won't show the dirtI could wash but I don't even botherSome piece of trite trash trumpets out the radiobut I don't turn it offI need to loathe its creationComtempt is my one contemplation'cause I know what I don't wantI really know what I don't wantI don't really really know what I want, do I?Red in the face from the air in this placeIt's close so I open a windowSomething about heights makes a manstart to reach for the bottomDull in the mind from oversleepingI look for the things that are really worth keeping'cause I know what I don't wantI really know what I don't wantI don't really really know what I want, do I?I know what I don't wantI really know what I don't wantI don't really really know what I want, do I?
