She wraps her tragic moments tightly around her neckthen she hangs herself with them as I try to disconnect..Cuz she wants to choke on her life again.Breathing it in like a deadly poison.She crys cuz she's lost and she doesn't even know what she wants.Her eyes grow cold as she begs the world to just let her go.But i wont let her go!She lives and breathes in a world that brought her to her kneesand now I'm addicted to her cuz that girl is just like me.and I'm going to choke on her life again.I'm breathing it in like a deadly poison.I just want to get through to her, before her last breath.She crys cuz she's lost and she doesn't even know what she wants.Her eyes grow cold as she begs the world to just let her go.She cries cuz she's lost and she doesn't even know what she wants.And she hides all alone inside the pain that she won't let go.Watching her life pass her by, watching it all through her watering eyes..But I'll be chasing dragonflies from her darkest skies until the day she dies.
