Motionless in timeMy instincts are a crimeEventually he'll seeIt's swirling into meThe air surrounds my mindI'm swimming through the skyPlease liquefy my needI cannot learn to breatheCan't keep pretending not to hateJust take me down and shred my fateThis time you've got me bound and tiedMy turn is up, your time to hideThese anxious ties restraining meForgive me now, I must go freeI'll liquefy your needsYou will not learn to breatheYou will not learn to breatheThere's no escaping now you see'Cause time is suffocating meI cannot learn to breatheMotionless in timeMy instincts are a crimeEventually he'll seeIt's swirling into meThe air surrounds my mindI'm swimming through the skyPlease liquefy my needI cannot learn to breatheCan't keep pretending not to hateJust take me down and shred my fateThis time you've got me bound and tiedMy turn is up, your time to hideEventually I'll break awayControl the gnawing urge to stayForgive me now I must go freeI cannot learn to breathe
