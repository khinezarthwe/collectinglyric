Since you're gone there is an empty spaceSince you're gone the world is not the sameI go back to the places we've beenFeels like you're still thereI live all those moments againWishing you were hereSince you're gone there is a lonely heartSince you're gone nothing is like it wasThere are memories all over the placeBringing it back all so clearRemember all of those daysWishing you were hereAll those lonely nights, lonely nightsLonely nights, lonely nights, lonely nightsI got to fight for you, yes I doAll those lonely nights, lonely nightsLonely nights, lonely nights, lonely nightsI got to fight for you, yes I doYes, I doSince you're gone there is a heart that bleedSince you're gone I'm not the man I used to beI follow your steps in the snowTraces disappearWe know what we've lost when it's goneI'm wishing you were hereAll those lonely nights, lonely nightsLonely nights, lonely nights, lonely nightsI got to fight for you, yes I doAll those lonely nights, lonely nightsLonely nights, lonely nights, lonely nightsI got to fight for you, yes I doYes, I doI go back to the places we've beenFeels like you're still thereI live all those moments againWishing you were hereAll those lonely nights, lonely nights, lonely nights...
