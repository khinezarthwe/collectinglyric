Blind me with distractionBuild a frontier ‘cross the voidAll tomorrow been destroyed, in a breathI moved out to the countryAnd I saw the scenery shakeAs a summer parade meets it’s deathAnd God’s assassins rode back into townAnd paved their way upon the cold, cold groundRoses help me to pretendBlushing brides and cosmonautsDon’t meet their bitter endGive me grace oh MotherI have rumbled quite a feastTraced the footsteps of a Priest in the snowBut in my mind’s picture of every face I’ve ever lovedTravel lightly suck their blood before they goAnd God’s assassins rode back into townAnd paved their way upon the cold, cold groundRoses help me to pretendBlushing brides and cosmonautsDon’t meet their bitter endRoses, roses, cannot do this any more
