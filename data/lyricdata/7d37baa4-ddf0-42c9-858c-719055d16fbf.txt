As I did walk by Hampstead Fair,I came upon Mother Goose,So I turned her loose--She was screaming.And a foreign student said to meWas it really trueThere are elephants, lions too,Piccadilly Circus?Walked down by the bathing pondTo try and catch some sun.Saw at least a hundred school girlsSobbing into handkerchiefs as one.I don't believe they knewI was a schoolboy.And a bearded lady said to meIf you start your ravingAnd your misbehaving,You'll be sorry.And the chicken fancier came to playWith his long red beard,And his sister's weird--She drives a lorry.Laughed down by the putting green,I popped 'em in their holes.Four and twenty labourers were labouringAnd digging up their gold.I don't believe they knewThat I was Long John Silver.Saw Johnny Scarecrow make his roundsIn his jet black macWhich he won't give back--Stole it from a snowman.As I did walk by Hampstead Fair,I came upon Mother Goose,So I turned her loose--She was screaming.Walked down by the bathing pondTo try and catch some sun.Must have been least a hundred school girlsSobbing into handkerchiefs as one.I don't believe they knewI was a schoolboy.
