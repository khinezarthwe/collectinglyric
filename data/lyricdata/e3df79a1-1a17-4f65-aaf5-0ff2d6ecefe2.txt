I owe you a love songSo much I could sayI owe you a love songWords that I can't sayRemember the daysOf sleepless summer nightsThat took us awayA perfect place, a different timeBack when nothing was wrongNow we're each sold separatelyOur summers are goneGrey skies are all I seeThese broken days won't last foreverYou know I'll put us back togetherI owe you a love songSo much I could sayI owe you a love songWords that I can't sayWaiting aloneIn the world you made for meMakes staying in loveJust a world of make believeWhere I'm playing alongAnd your words aren't clear to meLike hearing a songWithout a melodyThese broken days won't last foreverYou know I'll put us back togetherI owe you a love songSo much I could sayI owe you a love songWords that I can't sayWe climb, we crawlTear down the wallThat we've torn down beforeIt's not too lateThis song will sayWhat I never sayI owe you a love songSo much I could sayI owe you a love songWords that I can't sayI owe you a love songSo much I could sayI owe you a love songWords that I can't say
