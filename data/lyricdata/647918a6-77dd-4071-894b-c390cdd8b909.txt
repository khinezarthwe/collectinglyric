Travel the seaside MichiganWalk on the water with a friendOn the pretty wavesI've been a real bad family manSucking the white light IndiansOn the mountainBut I'm gonna tryI'm gonna pave the way at nightSinging the gospel in my mindWalking on blue waves, blue wavesRadiate and driveAll my lifeMake me real life hurricaneFollow a straight line to the brinkOn the good daysYou've been a teenage runawayCarry the people that you hateIn a suitcaseWell I'm gonna tryI'm gonna pave the way at nightNothing but gospel in my mindWalking on blue waves, blue wavesRadiate and driveAll my life
