One thing that you've got to knowDon't want this damn miseryWhen you find out what i meanWe will both wash ashoreI thought you were strongerI didn't even understandToday i know i was wrongI'm taking no more demandToday's the day for finding outWhere the road begins to windNow i know what you're all aboutI'm taking no more of this unkind1st Chorus:You put my heart in quarantineWish we could be like beforeThis feels like a hammerComing down on me2nd Chorus:Feels like a hammerSure she shot enough of meNot changing the way i feelTry to make a fool out of meI've about had enough, you seeThe death of this is just a gameNo nails to build what's tornI'll be stronger next time aroundShe's gonna have to stop draggin' me down1st Chorus2nd Chorus1st Chorus2nd Chorus
