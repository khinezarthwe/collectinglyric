We've never been much chopAt all that sensual stuffOne of us always seems to stopBefore the other's had enoughLike a self-help manual that's been written in BrailleIt seems the more that we touchThe more we learn about our failingsI'm struck speechless by the nape of your neckBut your requests and suggestionsHave a similar effectA litany of prettiness and pettiness, tooI reckon every second secondWe come up with something newI tried to write an opera for usBut I didn't get that far'Cause trying to sum you up in songIs like catching sunlight in a jarComplex, completely credible loveThe kind that is made, not handed to you from aboveIs difficult to talk about and harder to writeLike the rhythm of a pulse, or the contours of firelightOverblown libretto and a sumptuous scoreCould never contain the contradictions I adoreWe can just be chaos and then something alignsIt's so hard to contain, maintain it or define itI tried to write another chorusBut I didn't get that far'Cause trying to sum you up in songIs like catching sunlight in a jarIt's like catching sunlight in a jar
