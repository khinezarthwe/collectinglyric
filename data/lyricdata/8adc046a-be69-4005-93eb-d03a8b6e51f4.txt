Who kicked a hole in the skySo the heavens would cry over me?Who stole the soul from the sunIn a world come undone at the seams?Let there be loveLet there be loveI hope the weather is calmAs you sail up your heavenly streamSuspended clear in the skyAre the words that we sing in our dreamsLet there be loveLet there be loveLet there be loveLet there be loveCome on, baby blueShake up your tired eyes, the world is waiting for youMay all your dreaming fill the empty skyBut if it makes you happy, keep on clappingJust remember I'll be by your sideAnd if you don't let go, it's gonna pass you byWho kicked a hole in the skySo the heavens would cry over me?Who stole the soul from the sunIn a world come undone at the seams?Let there be loveLet there be loveLet there be loveLet there be loveLet there be loveLet there be loveLet there be loveLet there be loveLet there be love
