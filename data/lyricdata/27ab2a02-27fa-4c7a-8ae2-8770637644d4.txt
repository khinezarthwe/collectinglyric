I've often dreamt of a conversationThat just keeps on coming up again and againWe're sitting in the baby bar bereftAt a shadowy table out past the sentence's endIt's an emergency without endFrom until it's no longer funTo that's no longer relevantFrom until we're no longer oneTo the bona fide embodimentOf an endless emergency without endWe're an endless emergency without endWe often stop in these conversationsThings we say here stay here forever, amenWhen everything seems either funny or lousyFunny or lousy, that's where it usually endsWe're an emergency without endFrom until it's no longer funTo that's no longer relevantFrom until we're no longer oneTo that's no longer permanentFrom the last survivors of those termsTo the bona fide embodimentOf an endless emergency without endWe're an endless emergency without endWe're an endless emergency without endWe're an endless emergency without endBut your finger starts to wiggleAnd landscapes emerge
