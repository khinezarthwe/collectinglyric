We must talk in every telephone, get eaten off the webWe must rip out all the epilogues from the books that we have readAnd in the face of every criminal strapped firmly to a chairWe must stare, we must stare, we must stareWe must take all of the medicines too expensive now to sellSet fire to the preacher who is promising us hellAnd in the ear of every anarchist that sleeps but doesn't dreamWe must sing, we must sing, we must singAnd it'll go like this, all right:While my mother waters plants my father loads his gunHe says, "Death will give us back to GodJust like the setting sunIs returned to the lonesome ocean"And then they splashed into the deep blue seaOh, it was a wonderful splashWe must blend into the choir, sing a static with the wholeWe must memorize nine numbers and deny we have a soulAnd in this endless race for property and privilege to be wonWe must run, we must run, we must runWe must hang up in the belfry where the bats and moonlight laughWe must stare into a crystal ball and only see the pastAnd in the caverns of tomorrow with just our flashlights and our loveWe must plunge, we must plunge, we must plungeAnd then we'll get down thereWay down to the very bottom of everythingAnd then we'll see it, oh, we'll see it!, we'll see it!, we'll see it!Oh, my morning's coming backThe whole world's waking upAll the city buses swimming pastI'm happy just becauseI found out I am really no one
