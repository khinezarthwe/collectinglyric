Breathe in for luck, breathe in so deepThis air is blessed, you share with meThis night is wild, so calm and dullThese hearts they race from self-controlYour legs are smooth as they graze mineWe're doing fine, we're doing nothing at allMy hopes are so high that your kiss might kill meSo won't you kill me?So I die happyMy heart is yoursTo fill or burstTo break or buryOr wear as jewelryWhichever you preferThe words are hushed, "let's not get busted"Just lay entwined here undiscoveredSafe in here from all the stupid questions"Hey did you get some?""Man, that is so dumb."Stay quiet, stay near, stay close, they can't hearSo we can get someMy hopes are so high that your kiss might kill meSo won't you kill me?So I die happyMy heart is yoursTo fill or burstTo break or buryOr wear as jewelryWhichever you preferHands down, this is the best day I can ever rememberI'll always remember the sound of the stereoThe dim of the soft lights, the scent of your hairThat you twirled in your fingersAnd the time on the clock when we realized it's so lateAnd this walk that we shared togetherThe streets were wet and the gate was lockedSo I jumped it, and I let you inAnd you stood at your door with your hands on my waistAnd you kissed me like you meant itAnd I knew, that you meant itThat you meant itThat you meant itAnd I knew, that you meant it, that you meant it
