rap:It really isn't clearWhat the story is my dearSo I'll have to analyzeAll those lies and alibisOne look was all it tookCause I know you like a bookYou think you're cleaverThose endeavors, that you're hidingI'm deciding that we're throughStrangeGot a feeling you've been lying to me latelyWhen we kiss I get a bad vibrationYou tried to hide the guilt in your eyesLeaving clues without a traceWe used to talk and now you're always quietI ask you why, you say that you're just tiredYou get a call and you're ready to walk out the doorAnd I think it's kinda strangebridgeMy suspicions are killing meBut I don't wanna point the finger at youYou say I shouldn't place the blameBut it seems you're playing gamesHow much longer must I tolerate this madnesschorusStrangeSo low I can't get under itSo high I can't get over itSo wide I can't get around itAnd it's looking mighty strangeYesterday I saw you across townBuying roses, that's something you never doWhen you got home, hello is all I got from youDon't cha think that's kinda strangeI been feelin kinda funny since the last timeCause you left in such a hurry, tryin' to buy timeIf you're doing what I'm thinking that you're goingThen I think you need to changebridgechorusrap:I can't say whenBut it seems it all beganWhen I felt an icy tingle down my spineYou say it's in my mindSo I must resolve to findLittle pieces of the puzzle that fitYou think you're so slickBut I'm up on all your tricksAnd I think you're soon to beA small part of historyI know it's hard to seeSo how you are cheating meYou can't hideI can't stop itCan't get by itAnd to top it off, you're strange
