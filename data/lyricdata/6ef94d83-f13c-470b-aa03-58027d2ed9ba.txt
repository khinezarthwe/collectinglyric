()I am a man of constant sorrowI've seen trouble all my daysI bid farewell to old KentuckyThe place where I was born and raised()For six long years I've been in troubleNo pleasure here on earth I foundFor in this world I'm bound to rambleI have no friends to help me now()It's fare thee well, my old true loverI never expect to see you againFor I'm bound to ride that northern railroadPerhaps I'll die upon this train()You can bury me in some deep valleyFor many years where I may layThen you may learn to love anotherWhile I am sleeping in my grave()Maybe your friends think I'm just a strangerMy face you never will see no moreBut there is one promise that is givenI'll meet you on God's golden shore()
