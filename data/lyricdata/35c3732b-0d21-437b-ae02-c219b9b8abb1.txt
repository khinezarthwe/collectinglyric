Once we jumped off the boat and into the jungle,We cranked up the volume and marched to our own drummer.Many nasty things could await me;Noise discipline had to be maintained.Sounds carried incredibly far in the jungle.Had it been heard by any bad boys?Suddenly my brain screamed, "STOP!"And my right leg froze in mid-air.My heart slammed in my throat.The next few seconds took forever;My hands were shakingand my nervous system was in some kind of shock.Then, silence got blown apart...By Breakbeat Kaos.
