My heart is beating but the soul has diedMy body's breathing beneath catatonic eyesThe blood is flowing, set free for demiseI've lost my balance but god knows I triedI don't want to be here anymore in scarlet lettersCarved into what once was meOnce was yours no more.....no moreAn uphill battle I failed to climbI left it all now and I don't mindBetrayed and broken consumed by the lightFarewell to you all. I'll be fine. GoodbyeI don't want to be here anymore in scarlet lettersCarved into what once was meOnce was yours no moreI don't want to be here anymore in scarlet lettersTorn in two, a piece of me, the peace in you no moreDo you believe in lossDo you believe in faithDo you believe in deathNow that I'm goneForsaken me ashes to dust just let me lieLay me to rest, I've done my best but lost my sightTurning my back, leave me alone let spirit riseKnives in my back, all hope is lostSay goodbye-Solo-I don't want to be here anymore in scarlet lettersCarved into what once was meOnce was yours no moreI don't want to be here anymoreI don't want to be here anymore the scarlet lettersCarved into what once was meOnce was yours no more
