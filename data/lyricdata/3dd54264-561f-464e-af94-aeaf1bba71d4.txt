I still hang around neither lost nor foundHear the lonely sound of music in the nightNights are always brightThat's all that's left for me, yeahI play the street lifeBecause there's no place I can goStreet life, it's the only way I knowStreet lifeAnd there's a thousand cards to playUntil you play your life awayYou dress and walk and talkYou're who you think you areStreet life, you can run away from timeStreet life, for a nickel, for a dimeStreet life, but you better not get oldOr you're gonna feel the coldThere's always love for saleA grown up fairy talePrince charming always smilesBehind a silver spoonAnd if you keep t youngYour song is always sungYour love will pay your way beneath the silver moonStreet life, street life, street life, oh street life...
