Woke up to some bad news todayFor a while my eyes stayed closed,didn't want to face what I had to face.Sometimes the truth can cut you just like the cold.And I feel cold. I feel old.But it could be so good, If I only could,Walk you home tonight,Walk you tonight.Somtimes I feel there's no difference,between living and dreaming.Today for some reason I feel like there is.Sun is shining, leaves are falling down.Nobody seems to care, that you're not there, you're not there.But it could be so good, If I only could,Walk you home tonight,Walk you tonight.Feel like I know what crying is, Oh I know what dying is.Feel I know what crying is, Oh I know what dying is.Sun is shining, leaves are falling down
