Coming home to haunt youTo a town that I forgotAnd you can let me, let me downBut baby why do you give up?A soldier fallsHe's a warriorIn the battle zoneWhen the bullets rip in to your heartWe can drain your bloodNot before you lay down all of your rules and suchNo kissesHands that feel hollowA symbol on a wallThis isn't healthy, healthy loveBut baby why did we give up?A soldier fallsHe's a warriorIn the battle zoneWhen the bullets rip in to your heartWe can drain your bloodNot before you lay down all of your rules and suchNo kissesI surrender, I surrender you everythingI give over my whole world of make believeAfter all in this world you could do much betterYou deserve much better then this, better then this, better then meWhen the bullets rip in to your heartWe can drain your bloodNot before you lay down all of your rules and suchNo kisses
