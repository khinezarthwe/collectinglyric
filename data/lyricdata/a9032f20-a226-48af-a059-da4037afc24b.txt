I wanna rob you of your game faceso I can cower beneath your words.Cause I'm a freak from the same placelet suicide make a meal for birdsInto your heart, I've got the dagger;the metaphor will suffice for now.Get in my bed, i wanna kill you;Show you mine if you show me how.I get angry,When you're around, when you're around.I get nasty,When you're around, when you're around.She slither wristsfor attentionin 1996.She slither wristslistening to live through this.So here I am, will you deny me?Metal now, but I've always been.Lets make a toast.Lets do the oil spillLet the seagulls pick out the sins.I want it now,I want the danger.Give me strength and I'll give you wings.I get angry,When you're around, when you're around.I get nasty,When you're around, when you're around.L-o-o-o-o-w-w-w-wI get angry,When you're around, when you're around.I get nasty,When you're around, when you're around.I get angry,When you're around, when you're around.I get nasty,When you're around, when you're around.
