This is a song about an innocentWho died at the hands of a desperate manHe trusted those who he thought he knewHe trusted those who he looked up toI'll never forget the joy in his faceHe'd laugh and he'd cry and he'd ruin my placeHe'd drive me crazy, and he'd drive me wildI used to scream and shout all day longNow I hope you know this songIs about a child who now has goneAnd other children like him, tooAbused and used by what adults doSo don't tell me about politicsOr all the problems of our economicsWhen you can't look after what you can't ownYou scream and shout all day long
