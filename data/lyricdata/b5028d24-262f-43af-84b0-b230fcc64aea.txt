I remember how we metbut your name I forgetlike the door that I have kept unopenedI remember it was wetand the swelter and the sweatand the shelter of the bed we were cloaked inYou were stroking me like a petbut you didn't own me yetand the tape in the cassette deck was chokingSpat out a broken hallelujahBut I've seen the way the earththrows its aces with a curveYou were waiting for the wordsto come to yer.Just to say that you prefer to be lonelyto be cursedand to do the very worst you can do.Yeah I remember you like a versethat I didn't want to learnI just looked into your eyesand I knew yer.Now the thought of you is burnton my body from the first time you did rewind that line from Hallelujah.The original Leonard Cohen version.Well I wish I never met you that dayYou said I have a room and music to playI have a room let me show you the wayI wish that I'd never comeBut now that I have, I would do it againI would forget like I'd piss on a graveI would forget like I'd piss on a gravethat the words as they came to my tongue were hallelujah. Hallelujah!And the sky was so much bluerHallelujah! Hallelujah!And the world was so much newer.You said I have a roomat the top of the stairsI have a room with a viewI know we all have a cross that we bearand I'd like to show it to you.And you left me in the lightand you met me in the lightand we only had a night between the two.You were waiting for the worstYou were listening for a cursebut the only thing I heard was hallelujah.Hallelujah! Hallelujah!And the sky was so much bluerHallelujah! Hallelujah!And the world was so much newer.you said I have a roomat the top of the stairs.I have a room with a view.I know we all have a cross that we bearand I'd like to give it to you.And I won't forget how the sky was setI said I have a place to go back to.La La La I will have you yetI will carry you there if I have to.No I won't forget no I won't.No I won't forget no I won'tNo I won't forget no I won'tNo I won't forget no.Woah. Woah. Woah. W-o-o-o-ah.First love.
