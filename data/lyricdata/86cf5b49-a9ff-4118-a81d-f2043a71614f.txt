There is nothing to see here, people, keep moving onSlowly their necks turn, and then they're goneNo one cares when the show is doneStanding in line, and it's cold, and you want to goRemember a joke, so you turn aroundThere is no one to listen, so you laugh by yourselfI heard it's cold out, but her popsicle meltsShe's in the bathroom, she pleasures herselfSays I'm a bad man, she's locking me outIt's 'cause of these things, it's 'cause of these thingsLet's make a fast plan, watch it burn to the groundI try to whisper, so no one figures it outI'm not a bad man, I'm just overwhelmedIt's 'cause of these things, it's 'cause of these thingsThe crowd on the street walks slowly, don't mind the rainLovers hold hands to numb the painGripping tightly to something that they will never ownAnd those by themselves by choice or by some rewardNo mistakes, only now you're boredThis is the time of your life, but you just can't tellI heard it's cold out, but her popsicle meltsShe's in the bathroom, she pleasures herselfSays I'm a bad man, she's locking me outIt's 'cause of these things, it's 'cause of these thingsLet's make a fast plan, watch it burn to the groundI try to whisper, so no one figures it outI'm not a bad man, I'm just overwhelmedIt's 'cause of these things, it's 'cause of these thingsI heard it's cold out, but her popsicle meltsShe's in the bathroom, she pleasures herselfSays I'm a bad man, she's locking me outIt's 'cause of these things, it's 'cause of these thingsLet's make a fast plan, watch it burn to the groundI try to whisper, so no one figures it outI'm not a bad man, I'm just overwhelmedIt's 'cause of these things, it's 'cause of these things
