Comrades. People of the world. We ain't got nothing to lose but the goddamn bourgeoisie blues. Mr I.V. Lenin, the Lenin of Love, gonna make us feel so finewith a hit of Socialism in the mainline.No way.Damn.You're right, I.V.That's right.I know you're searchin’ for some new sensation,'Cos I saw you with the Sugarman.You took a taste of that sweet salvation,Now you're eating out the palm of his hand.You hear some line from a song that reminds you,Of the time when you were seventeen.The memory moves you but you feel kind of confused,'Cos now money is your melody.Looks like.Temptation got a hold on you.She's eating away at your dreams.You're so hungry for that smell of money.You've been wasting away for years.Yeah, you been tempted brother.You been tempted sister, too.Hear you were hustling with some heavy connections,Hooked up on those dollars and dimes.You were looking for thrills and dressed up to kill,Any motherfucker messing with your goldmine.But now you, you walk the line trying to buy yourself time,With some honey-backed guarantee.But the bees they are buzzing, and the flies they are humming,Round the holes in your hypocrisy.Looks like.Temptation got a hold on you.She's eating away at your dreams.You're so hungry for that smell of money.You've been wasting away for years.Temptation got a hold on you.She's eating away at your dreams.You're so hungry for that smell of money.You've been wasting away for yearsWaste away now.What do we want?And what kind of power?Socialism straight in the mainline.Socialism straight in the mainline.See you wastin’ away now.[Repeat to fade]
