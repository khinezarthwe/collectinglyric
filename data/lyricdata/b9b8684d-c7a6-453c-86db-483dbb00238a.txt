Warm yourself by the fire, sonAnd the morning will come soonI'll tell you stories of a better timeIn a place that we once knewBefore we packed our bagsAnd left all this behind us in the dustWe had a place that we could call homeAnd a life no one could touchDon't hold me up nowI can stand my own groundI don't need your help nowYou won't let me down, down, down!Don't hold me up nowI can stand my own groundI don't need your help nowYou won't let me down, down, down, down!We are the angry and the desperateThe hungry, and the coldWe are the ones who kept quietAnd always did what we were toldBut we've been sweating while you slept so calmIn the safety of your homeWe've been pulling out the nails that hold upEverything you've knownDon't hold me up nowI can stand my own groundI don't need your help nowYou won't let me down, down, down!Don't hold me up nowI can stand my own groundI don't need your help nowYou won't let me down, down, down!So open your eyes childLet's be on our wayBroken windows and ashesAre guiding the wayKeep quiet no longerWe'll sing through the dayOf the lives that we've lostAnd the lives we've reclaimedGo!Don't hold me up nowI can stand my own groundI don't need your help nowYou won't let me down, down, down!Don't hold me up nowI can stand my own groundI don't need your help nowYou won't let me down, down, down!Don't hold me up...(I don't need your help, I'll stand my ground)Don't hold me up...(I don't need your help)No! No! No! Don't hold me up...(I don't need your help, I'll stand my ground)Don't hold me up...(I don't need your help, I'll stand my ground)Don't let me down, down, down, down, down!
