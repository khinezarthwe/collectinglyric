Moving on the floor now, babe, you're a bird of paradiseCherry ice cream smile, I suppose it's very niceWith a step to your left and a flick to the rightYou catch that mirror way out westYou know you're something special, and you look like you're the bestHer name is Rio and she dances on the sandJust like that river twisting through a dusty landAnd when she shines, she really shows you all she canOh, Rio, Rio dance across the Rio GrandeI've seen you on the beach and I've seen you on TVTwo of a billion stars, it means so much to meLike a birthday or a pretty viewBut then, I'm sure that you know it's just for youHer name is Rio and she dances on the sandJust like that river twisting through a dusty landAnd when she shines, she really shows you all she canOh, Rio, Rio dance across the Rio GrandeHey now, woo, look at thatDid she nearly run you down?At the end of the drive, the lawmen arriveYou make me feel alive, alive, aliveI'll take my chance, 'cause luck is on my side or somethingI know what you're thinking, I'll tell you something, I know what you're thinkingHer name is Rio and she dances on the sandJust like that river twists across a dusty landAnd when she shines, she really shows you all she canOh, Rio, Rio dance across the Rio GrandeHer name is Rio, she don't need to understandAnd I might find her if I'm looking like I canOh Rio, Rio, hear them shout across the landFrom mountains in the north down to the Rio Grande
