When you don't know who you areAnd you're walking with a scarIn the places that are breaking down your mindIt's a complicated dayBusy people on their wayMirrored buildings reflecting in your eyesSick city sometimesSick city in your mindSick city sometimesSick city left you way behindThrough the paper and the trashAll the needles and the cashSide by side with the man in the big carThen it turns the dead of nightAnd you get into a fightAnd the blades run down your back like superstarsSick city sometimesSick city in your mindSick city sometimesSick city left you way behindSick city sometimesSick city in your mindSick city sometimesSick city left you way behindSick city sometimesSick city in your mindSick city sometimesSick city left you way behindNow the buildings take a fallAnd it tries to kill us allIn the name of something zero in your mindNow the buildings take a fallAnd it tries to kill us allIn the name of something zero in your mindSick city sometimesSick city in your mindSick city sometimesSick city left you way behind
