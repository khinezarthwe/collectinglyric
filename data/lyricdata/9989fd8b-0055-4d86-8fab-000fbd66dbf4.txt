In the brightest hourOf my darkest dayI realizedWhat is wrong with meCan't get over youCan't get through to youIt's been a helter-skelterRomance from the startTake these memoriesThat are haunting meOf a paper man cut into shredsBy his own pair of scissorsHe'll never forgive herHe'll never forgive herBecause days come and goBut my feelings for you are foreverBecause days come and goBut my feelings for you are foreverSitting by a fireOn a lonely nightHanging over from another good timeWith another girlLittle dirty girlYou should listen to this story of a lifeYou're my heroineIn this moment I'm lonelyFulfilling my darkest dreamsAll these drugs, all these womenI'm never forgiving this broken heart of mineBecause days come and goBut my feelings for you are foreverBecause days come and goBut my feelings for you are foreverOne last kissBefore I goDry your tearsIt is time to let you goOne last kiss, one last kissBefore I go, before I goDry your tears, dry your tearsIt is time to let you goBecause days come and goBut my feelings for you are foreverBecause days come and goBut my feelings for you are foreverOne last kiss, one last kissBefore I go, before I goDry your tearsIt is time to let you goOne last kissBefore I goDry your tearsIt is time to let you goOne last kiss
