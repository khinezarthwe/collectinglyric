Did you hear about the lonely ones,who spend their days hid from the sun,where the spotlight never shone,where no one's eyes ever will fall or rest upon?So we feed them their dreamsbetween the lines upon the screens.Just a lonely boy in a lonely home.He's the lonely one, not the only one.Just a broken boy, in a broken home,he's the broken one, the unspoken one.Just a broken girl, living in a broken world,she's the broken one, not the only one.Lonely boys, lonely girls,they're all tuning in to Truth of the World.
