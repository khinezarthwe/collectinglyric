Summertime is easy when you're knowing uneasy and tweet I'm looking for the beatUnknowing that it speaksAnd the whole thing is a drownAnd it slides down the length of the tubSummertime is easy when you're knowing uneasy and peakUnknowing and the beat unknowing luck and heatAnd the whole beats like a drumAnd you wish it all knotted aloneOh and the whole thing comes riding aroundThat's when I love youAnd the whole beats like a drum (drug) beats (x6)
