I fell down in the desert baby, yeahI had nothing but a piece of paper, oh yeahI had to write something downAnd I found myself aloneThen I let go of everythingInto another dimensionPurple haze is in the skySee the angels wicked eyeAll these things we must try'Til we see the reasons why, oh yeahLightning crash on the hill tonight, yeahI got a feeling everything is gonna be alrightThen a horse came running to meSaid we're gonna go to the sanctuaryThen a storm began to blowInto another dimensionPurple haze is in the skySee the angels wicked eyeAll these things we must try'Til we see the reasons why, oh yeahI got lost in the desert baby, yeahI found temples made out of paper, oh yeahThey were drummin' with golden bonesBuildin' dreams up out of their homesThen I let go of everythingInto another dimension
