Time enters spaceNow is erasedDrugs rape the mindKills all you findIn a world of disorder I lie awakeKnowing there's nothing I can doIn a world of disorder I lie awakeKnowing there's something I can doTake what you lovePrey from aboveCry as you healSmile as they kneelIn a world of disorder I lie awakeKnowing there's nothing I can doIn a world of disorder I lie awakeKnowing there's something I can doRun from the fateCurse as they waitFly as you're stillPlay at your will
