I know I can't be in the sun too long,I know that it's terror if I scream too long.I know that the questions I ask are wrong,but your answers are right 'cuz you know I'm wrong.I think you should start to sing along when I start to get all the words just wrong.You've got a mouth that doesn't know weak from strong.Oh and it's a new day.Sorry I spoke of the past too long,but the future is boring, it takes too long.We finally found a place where we both belong, and theres no one in the room that can hear our song.I think you should start to sing along when I start to get all the words just wrong.You've got a mouth that doesn't know weak from strong.Oh and it's a new day.And although the words may be lying, I'm preferring the truth.I'm gonna make you over before they take you down.Your warmth is getting colder.Can you feel it?Now that the planet is dead and gone,we can finally buy the place that we sought all along.When we get home you can learn the song,and we can get a new band going before too long.And although the words may be lying, I'm preferring the truth.I'm gonna make you over before they take you down.Your warmth is getting colder.Can you feel it?I think you should start to sing along.I do, I do.
