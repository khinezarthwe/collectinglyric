Strange how their love bloomed in the winterOnly to vanish in the springIt never fails to make him shiverTo see the outline of her wingsWhere she made her last snow angelLittle did they knowThat it'd make a lasting impressionDeeper than the snowIn his soulThe snow angel never fadedAnd when love calls to make that promiseThe one to be faithful and be trueIt's then temptation falls upon usThe world turns awkward and aloofAnd with this betrayalAn angel descended from on highOh, but this was not a mangerAnd as he came insideTo his frightT'was no angel hanging nakedStrange how each year 'round late NovemberWhen the first snow is on the groundShe reappears so he'll rememberHow a love so young can be cut downWhen she made her last snow angelLittle did they knowThat it'd make a lasting impressionDeeper than the snowIn his soulThe snow angel never fadedIn his soulThe snow angel never faded
