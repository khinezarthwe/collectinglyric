If you only knew the painThe pain I keep insideThe pain that makes me "me"Then without it who am IIn a room with broken wallsI lay in scene and dreamsI want you to seeI'm cold and whiteI'm holding onI'll try to breathe for youI'm crying outI'm singing loudYou could be all I needAnd I'm losing my willJust to hold you inI'm giving up the hopeThat you could have been the oneTo save me from meAnd now our lips will meetand i'll taste their defeatI'll give in this onceI'm cold and whiteI'm holding onI'll try to breath for youI'm crying outI'm singing loudYou could be all I needStill I know I'll carry onGuide me through the life I lostTo find these faults in meTo find these faults in meI'm cold and whiteI'm holding onI'll try to breath for youI'm crying outI'm singing loudYou could be all I needI'm cold and whiteI'm holding onI'll try to breath for youI'm crying outI'm singing loudYou could be all I needTo save me from me
