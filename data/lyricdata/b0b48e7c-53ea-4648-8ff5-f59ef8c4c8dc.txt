Into the chaos, into the nightIt's something different, it's somewhere farInto the distance, into the lightThere's something happening, it's in our sideWith no direction, there's nothing wrongYeah, we can wonder all night longInto the chaos, into the nightIt's something new again, it's somewhere far from hereTemptation lies inside my heartWe'll never know if we don't startGive me a reason, we're in controlWhen everything that matters, could be our fallInto the chaos, into the nightThere's something happening, it's in our side, our sideTemptation lies inside my heartThere's nothing wrong if we don't startTemptation lies inside my heartWe'll never know if we don't startThese neon lights will ever fadeThere's nothing twice just once today
