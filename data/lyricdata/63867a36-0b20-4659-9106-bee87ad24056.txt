Gray light, new day leaks through the windowAn old soul song comes on the alarm clock radioWe walked the 40 blocks to the middleOf the place we heard that everything would beAnd there were barricades to keep us off the streetBut the crowd kept pushing forwardTill they swallowed the policeYeah they went wildYeah they went wildYeah they went wildYeah they went wildWe left before the dust had time to settleAnd all the broken glass swept off the avenueAnd all the way home held your camera like a BibleJust wishing so bad that it held some kind of truthAnd I stood nervous next to you, in the dark roomYou dropped the paper in my waterAnd it all begins to bloomYeah they go wildYeah they go wildYeah they go wildYeah they go wildAnd just when I get so lonesome, I can't speakI see some flowers on a hillsideLike a wall of new TV'sYeah they go wildYeah they go wildYeah they go wildYeah they go wildYeah they go wildYeah they go wildYeah they go wildYeah they go wild
