Again I see you standing there watching me.Your gaze, those eyes are tantalizing openly.Inviting me to get close to you,Can't help myself.There's fascination in the air.I try to fight this strong sensationBut there's no chance to escapeFrom this temptation.Feels like I've known you before,Repeating phrases,But I yearn for something more.I knowI can't stay by your sideForever,But I knowI won't forget your beauty,My Black Diamond.
