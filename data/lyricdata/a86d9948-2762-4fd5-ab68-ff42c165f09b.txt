We could wait for the wind to blowOr give me a look so cold...It gives me chillsAnd ends the summer warMy eyes rollAround and over and againFalling down, dizzy with sun strokeI'll be thereAnd i'll try to identify, try to look through the gray skies in your eyes..I'll pick up everything you left behindCross your fingers, and pray for winterI'll be therePainting the town your favorite color.Guess i'll call or see you around....yeahGuess i'll call or see you around.Guess i'll call or see you around....yeahGuess i'll call or see you around.I'll call, or see you around.I'll call, or see you around.I'll call, or see you around.I'll call, or see you around....painting the town your favorite color.
