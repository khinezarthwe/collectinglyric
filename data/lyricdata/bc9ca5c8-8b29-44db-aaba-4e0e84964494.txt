Hold it nowWait a minuteC'mon... whew...Just let me catch my breathI've heard the promises, I've seen the mistakesI've had my fair share of tough breaksI need a new voice, new law, new wayTake the time, reevaluateIt's time to pick up the pieces, go back to square oneI think it's time for a changeThere is something that I feelTo be something that is realI feel the heat within my mindAnd craft new changes with my eyesGiving freely wandering promisesA place with decisions I'll fashionI won't waste another breathYou can feel the waves coming on(It's time to take the time)Let them destroy you or carry you on(It's time to take the time)You're fighting the weight of the worldBut no one can save you this timeClose your eyesYou can find all you need in your mindUnbroken spirit, obscured and disquietFinds clearness this trial demandsAnd at the end of this day sighs an anxious reliefFor the fortune lies still in his handsIf there's a pensive fear, a wasted yearA man must learn to copeIf his obsession's realSuppression that he feels must turn to hopeLife is no more assuring than love(It's time to take the time)There are no answers from voices above(It's time to take the time)You're fighting the weight of the worldAnd no one can save you this timeClose your eyesYou can find all you need in your mindI close my eyesAnd feel the water rise around meDrown in the beat of timeLet my senses fall awayI can see much clearer now, I'm blind"Ora che ho perso la vista, ci vedo di piu"You can feel the waves coming on(It's time to take the time)Let them destroy you or carry you on(It's time to take the time)You're fighting the weight of the worldBut no one can save you this timeClose your eyesYou can find all you need in your mindOoh oohYeahFind all you need in your mindIf you take the timeFind all you need in your mindIf you take the time
