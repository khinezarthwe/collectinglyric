You're doing fineMost of the timeYou sit and wonder what tomorrow bringsAll kinds of thingsYou sit and waitYou hesitateJust like you never been in love beforeThere's so much moreOn your ownAnd though you feel aloneYou are aliveDon't you know it's just another day?All aloneInto this world we're thrownYou are aliveDon't you know it's just another day?On you ownAnd though you feel aloneYou are aliveDon't you know it's just another day?You turn aroundYou're lost and foundLooking for someone who will understandOr hold your handYou count the daysA hopeless caseBut for the first time you will wait for mePatientlyOn your ownAnd though you feel aloneYou are aliveDon't you know it's just another day?All aloneInto this world we're thrownYou are aliveDon't you know it's just another day?On your ownAnd though you feel aloneYou are alive (You are alive)Don't you know it's just another day?On your ownAnd though you feel aloneYou are alive (You are alive)Don't you know it's just another day?
