It's so lonely coming downIt's a long, long wait aroundIt's a hollow, hollow dayIt's a long, long, long, long way, way downFair and feather whiteLying in false paradiseI found you on your sideWeighed downDon't goCause you know I will followYou knowIf I lose you I'll go madIt's so lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lonely coming downIt's so lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lonely coming downAs the flames wash around meI only think of youI only want to save youBut I've done all I can doTo the end I would defend youIn heaven I'd suspend youI only want to save youI only want the truthIt's so lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lonely coming downIt's so lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lonely coming downDon't askCause you knew this could never lastYou were always going too fastYou were always going too fastIt's so lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lonely coming downIt's so lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lonely coming downTo the death I would defend youWith my life I will protect youI know I'm gonna save youI'll do all I can doAlone I'll beat the flames downI will defend your nameI'll descend through the fireI will carry you homeI will carry you homeI will carry you homeI will carry you home
