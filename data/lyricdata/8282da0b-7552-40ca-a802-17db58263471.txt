Hey brotherget yourself togetherDon't you waitCan't you seeI'm waiting in the shadowsto take your placeThere is a chancethat I'd keep tryingto tell you the truth,would end up lying to youCHORUSYou said you were lateand I planned my escapeSuch a happy thingjust another one of my mistakesSo you held your breatheand you cursed the westsaid you had no choiceYou're moving back east where men are menYour mothernever found a reasonto hesitateNow you're waitingFor a warmer welcomein coldest daysCHORUSLove's got no borderwhy don't you feel freeto cross my state lineand bring yourself to me?It's a hell of a struggleBeen grounded for yearsWords that I use up tooh for lonely earsCHORUS
