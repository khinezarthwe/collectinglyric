When you have nothing, you haven't even hope to spare.You're exactly where you want to be.You wouldn't have it any other way.Any other way would be complication.Depression ain't so bad.Makes you wish you'd never been born,But you always jump right back.Now i've been on top of the world,And i've been stuck at the bottom.I have kicked and i've crawled,Tried to get my way back up.But there's nothing wrong with a break before you get back up.Depression ain't so bad.Look at all the good it's done robert johnson.
