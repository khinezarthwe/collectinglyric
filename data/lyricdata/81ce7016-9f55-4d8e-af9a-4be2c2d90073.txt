Sled dogs after dinnerClose their eyes on the howling wastesKurt Cobain reincarnatedSighs and licks his faceThen they drift past strips of SerengetiAnd the gates of Sleepy Hollow tooYou can pause in wonder, they paused in wonderAnd, yeah, I paused in wonder tooShhhDon'tWakeDaddyThey can lay their heads on their futon bedsSo many miles from homeYou teach your children some fashion senseAnd they fashion some of their ownFor when the policy weary communeOn the untamed landThrough white sheers, whispers in their ears"You're damned"ShhhAnd don'tWakeDaddyJust don'tYou can stuff your void with the asteroidThat's hurtling toward the EarthYou can drop the bomb that restores some calmAnd then promises rebirthShhhJust don'tWakeDaddyJust don'tWakeDaddyIt's the perfect time now (sing to end all songs)For an eclectic choice (to end all songs)They're all asleep but us now (sing to end all songs)It's time to hear your voice (to end all songs)(Sing to end all songs, to end all songs)(Sing to end all songs, to end all songs)(Sing to end all songs, to end all songs)(Sing to end all songs, to end all songs)
