Huah!Ahhh!This shining city built of goldA far cry from innocenceThere's more than meets the eye'Round here look to the waters of the deepA city of evilThere sat a seven-headed beastTen horns raised from his headSymbolic woman sits on his throneBut hatred strips her and leaves her nakedThe beast and the harlotWhoaShe's a dwelling place for demonsShe's a cage for every unclean spiritEvery filthy bird and makes us drinkThe poisoned wine to fornicating with our kingsFallen now is Babylon the GreatThe city dressed in jewels and goldFine linen, myrrh and pearlsHer plagues will come all at onceAs her mourners watch her burnDestroyed in an hourMerchants and captains of the worldSailors, navigators tooWill weep and mourn this lossWith her sins piled to the skyThe beast and the harlotOhShe's a dwelling place for demonsShe's a cage for every unclean spiritEvery filthy bird and makes us drinkThe poisoned wine to fornicating with our kingsFallen now is Babylon the GreatThe day has come for all us sinnersIf you're not a servant you'll be struck to the groundFlee the burning, greedy cityLooking back on her to see there's nothin' aroundI don't believe in fairytales and no one wants to go to HellYou've made the wrong decision and it's easy to seeNow if you wanna serve above or be a king below with usYou're welcome to the city where your future is setForeverShe's a dwelling place for demonsShe's a cage for every unclean spiritEvery filthy bird and makes us drinkThe poisoned wine to fornicating with our kingsFallen now is Babylon the GreatShe's a dwelling place for demonsShe's a cage for every unclean spiritEvery filthy bird and makes us drinkThe poisoned wine to fornicating with our kingsFallen now is Babylon the GreatHuah!
