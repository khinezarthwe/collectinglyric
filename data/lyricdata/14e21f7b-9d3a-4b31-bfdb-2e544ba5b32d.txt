There's not much left to loveToo tired today to hateI feel the emptyI feel the minute of decayI'm on my way down now, I'd like to take you with meI'm on my way downI'm on my way down now, I'd like to take you with meI'm on my way down(chorus)The minute that it's bornIt begins to dieI'd love to just give inI'd love to live this lieI've been to black and backI've whited out my nameA lack of pain a lack of hopeA lack of anything to sayThere is no cure for what is killing meI'm on my way downI've looked ahead and saw aWorld that's deadI guess that I am too(chorus)I'm on my way down, I'd like to take you with me...
