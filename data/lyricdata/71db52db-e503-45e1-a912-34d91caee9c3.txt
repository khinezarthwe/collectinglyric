Where’s your dirt gone honey?It would be good to have your tongueAnd where’s your voice gone sonny?You've got to step up, come on comeSo pick a costume for me honeyOh let me be your every dreamI’ll even be the love you lostYou’ll want me so much when I’m meanWhere’s your friends gone honey?It seems they want new companyBut I could never put you down, down, downIt would be good to have your tongueAnd now our time is runningI watch you watch me fade to greySo pick a costume for me honeyWe still got plenty love to playWhere’s your gun to sonny?I'm turning mean and you need funWell pick a costume for me honeyIt would be good to have your tongueAnd if you want just shoot me deadFor there is nothing left to comeThere is no wonder left to seeNot through the FOG that’s hold of me
