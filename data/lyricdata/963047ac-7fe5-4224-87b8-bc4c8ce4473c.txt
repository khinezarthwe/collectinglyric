All at once,the world can overwhelm meThere's almost nothin' that you could tell methat could ease my mindWhich way will you runwhen it's always all around youand the feelin' lost and found you againA feelin' that we have no controlAround a songSome sayTheres gonna be the new hellSome sayIt's still too early to tellSome sayIt really ain't no myth at allKeep askin' ourselves "Are we reallystrong enough?"There's so many things that we got too proud ofWe're too proud ofWe're too proud ofI wanna take the preconceivedout from underneath your feetWe could shake it offinstead we'll plant some seedsWe'll watch em' as they growand with each new beatfrom your heart the roots grow deeperthe branches will they reach for whatNobody really knowsBut underneath it allthere's this heart all aloneWhat about is goneand it really won't be so longSometimes it feels like a heart is no place to be singin' from at allThere's a world we've never seenThere's still hope between the dreamsThe weight of it allcould blow away with a breezeIf you're waitin' on the winddon't forget to breathecause as the darkness gets deeperwe'll be sinkin' so we reach for loveAt least somethin' we could holdBut I'll reach to you from where time just can't goWhat about is goneand it really won't be so longSometimes it feels like a heart is no place to be singin' from at all
