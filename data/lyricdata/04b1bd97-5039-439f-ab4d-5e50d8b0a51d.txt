I've seen this one before, the girl she gets awayEverybody knows it but no one tries to stop itCause she barely even knows him but if she could see insideEverything is quiet as she waits to tell him who she isIs this all we get to be absoluteQuiet but I'm sure there is something hereTell me everything cause I want to hearIt's a kiss sits upon on her lips that waits for planes and battle shipsShe wants to be a dancer and he has got a pictureOn his wall and it's a sailor in a new port every nightYet man was born to trouble like sparks fly upwards innocentIs this all we get to be absoluteQuiet but I'm sure there is something hereTell me everything cause I want to hearQuiet but I'm sure there is something hereTell me everything cause I want to hearAll we are and all we want40 years come and goneAll we are in photographsWill never be takenQuiet but I'm sure there is something hereTell me everything cause I want you hereQuiet but I'm sure there is something hereTell me everything cause I want to hearQuiet but I'm sure there is something hereTell me everything cause I want to hearThere is something here(Absolute)There is something here(Absolute)
