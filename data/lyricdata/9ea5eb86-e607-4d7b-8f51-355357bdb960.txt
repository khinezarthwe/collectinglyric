AboutchaThey say that goodbyeArrives by designWho do you think about when you're lonely?I remember when you used to singAbout your one and onlyYou're such a phonyNow I finally know you really know meMiles away and miles aboveThe vampire only wants a little loveA little love, a little moreHe's got ya nowYou're gone for sure
