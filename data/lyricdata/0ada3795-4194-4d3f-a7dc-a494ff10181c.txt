(The following song is brought to you by Chex Mix)Some dude once said that love is a many funny thingsI know there's a perfect girl out there for me, 'cause I see herin my dreamsDream girl, you're a fantasy, you're the only oneOut there for meMy loveDream girl you amaze me all dressed in paisleyLove how not one but both eyes are lazyWhen I first saw you you were drivin' the busThick skin, strong nose like a rhinocerosDream girl so beautiful, lips all crumbySkin like asphalt, nose so runnyThick thighs, no waist, not a care in the worldYou not crazy girl, you just my baby girlYou're a vision in sweats with a neon pouchHalf eaten squirrel hangin' outta your mouthRainbow poncho, the female TontoHear a loud noise start b-buckin' like a broncoDream girl, you're a fantasy, you're the only oneOut there for meMy loveYou got your cellphone ring set to Sex and the CityYou like a hot bowl of grits only way more grittyStraight drippin' your turquoise my Santa Fe queenOne short leg you got the Santa Fe LeanIt's music to my ears when you scream in your sleepAnd when you lift your skirt in public yo I can't help but peekYou like Cleopatra with the eyes of a pigLove to watch you in the backyard when you go out to digGirl how'd you get those mouse traps glued to your neckLittle rascal, how'd you get screwed to the deck?You put away Slurpees like a trash canYour smiles all stainy and your not too brainy andI like that!Talking to your shoe like it's your friendI like that!Yellin' at the walls of make pretendI like that!Tellin' you to stop it then you don'tYou said you gonna stab me in my sleepBut you won't!Last week thought I saw you on the street turned out it was a bag of trashJust a big ol' bag of trashI thought you looked like a bag of trashDream girl I pitch a tent when you stomp in the roomLike a hellbound turkey mixed with a baboonYou're sexy and you're spicy like a bowl of Chex MixAnd I always feel safe when I'm in your flesh mittsYour teeth so clean coulda swore you were BritishNever take the Chex Mix 'cause you always get skittishOpen clams with both feet 'cause you're ambidextrousNo point 'cause we know you eat nothin' but Chex MixChex Mix number one food snack in the landIt's the cereal taste that you eat with your handChex Mix at your local grocer buy a boxYour family will all sayChex Mix rocks!Chex Mix, you're the snack for me, you're the only oneI'll ever eat or buyChex Mix you're delicious, you got 60% less fat than potato chipsTM
