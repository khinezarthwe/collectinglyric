I'm home again, I won the warAnd now I am behind your doorI tried so hard to obey the lawSee the meaning of it allRemember me? Before the warI'm the man who lived next doorLong agoAs you can see, when you look at meI'm pieces of what I used to beIt's easier if you don't seeMe standing on my own two feetI'm taller when I sit here stillYou ask are all my dreams fulfilledThey made me a heart of steelThe kind the bullets cannot seeNothing's what it seems to beI'm a replica, I'm a replicaEmpty shell inside of meI'm not myself, I'm a replica of meThe light is green, my slate is cleanNew life to fill the hole in meI had no name, last DecemberChristmas Eve - I can't rememberI was in a constant painI saw your shadow in the rainI painted all your pictures redI wish I had stayed home insteadYeah!Nothing's what it seems to beI'm a replica, I'm a replicaEmpty shell inside of meI'm not myself, I'm a replica of meAre you gonna leave me now, when it is all over?Are you gonna leave me, is my world now over?Raising from the place I've beenAnd trying to keep my home base cleanNow I'm hereAnd won't go back, believeI fall asleep and dream a dreamI'm floating in a silent streamNo-one placing blame on meBut nothing's what it seems to be, yeahNothing's what it seems to beI'm a replica, I'm a replicaEmpty shell inside of meI'm not myself, I'm a replica of me
