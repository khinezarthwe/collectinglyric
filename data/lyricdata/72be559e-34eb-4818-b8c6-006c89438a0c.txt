Our margins and revisions, where we both first made our livingIn an alcove filled with sawdust, there a new light fell upon usHail the lepers, call the outcastsDid we just not know to askI could see you blazing through the frostIn amazing grace and a hacking coughTook dictation, wrote it shorthand,Noone's sorrier than I amI was young, that's no excuseFor the harm and the abuseSo what was it that you wantedWhat would you've done if you had got it?It was always ever gonna go so farTil someone thought to push you from the carAccept no imitation, baby, catch a collapsing starBut it's your limitations that make you what you areOur margins and revisions,Where we both first learned forgivenessBy the moonlight in the forest,Where our lives spread out before usSo you wrote me in a letterYou can stay gone but don't stay bitterIt was always ever gonna end the sameTil someone thought to push you 'neath the trainTook vacation in new orleansAnd I held you on the shore thereSplurged your words, confused your thoughtsSpoke in riddles noone gotSo what was it that we wantedAnd God forbid if we had got itIt was always gonna have to go too farTil someone turned the light out at the barAccept no imitation, baby, catch a collapsing starOh it's our limitations,It's our limitations,Oh it's our limitations,That make us what we are
