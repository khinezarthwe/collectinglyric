Four more rotations and no one will hurtThese are the things I dream ofI've been thinking through the drinkingThough my confidence is shrinkingThat I might be fineThe North would be so proud of youWhat would you doWhen the stars fall from the skyAnd you're only two seconds from crying?Parafin, Anadin, sick as disguiseSo we take our snappy patternsAnd use them as knivesNow there's nothing left for me to tryMy own medicine and humble pieBut I'll be alrightThe North would be so proud of youSo I'll see you tomorrowShall we call it one?Trying to get sparks to lightSeeing as they've goneYou don't know how to value thatBut I know how to value thatI think we'll be fineThe North would be so proud of youWhat would you doWhen stars fall from the skyAnd you're only two seconds from crying?
