Take my hand, my dear,We know that the time it is near,Be strong and be brave, my dear,Let me go now,Let me go.How it came to this it's not clear,Long and lonely nights now I fear,Though I need your hand to hold, my dear,Let me go now,Let me go.Let me go now,Let me go.Take my hand, my dearWe were drifting year after year,When we tried our best to fly, my dear,Let me go now,Let me go.How it came to this it's not clear,Long and lonely nights now I fear,Be strong and be brave my dear,Let me go now,Let me go.Let me go now,Let me go.Take my hand, my dearLove takes us far away from here,Tell me once again, so I hear,Let me go now,Let me go.Let me go now,Let me go.Let me go now,Let me go.
