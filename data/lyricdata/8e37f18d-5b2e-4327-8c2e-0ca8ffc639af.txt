It's 6 AMThe clock is ringingI need to spendAn hour snoozing'Coz I don't think I'm gonna make itI punch inI'm still sleepingWatch the clockBut it's not movingCause everyday is never endingI need to work I'm always spendingAnd I feel like I'm living the worst day over and over againAnd I feel like the summer is leaving againI feel like I'm living the worst dayI feel like you're goneAnd every day is the worst day everYesterday was the worst day everAnd tomorrow won't be betterIt's history repeating on and onSummer plans are gone foreverI'd trade them in for dishpan waterAnd everyday is never endingI need to work I'm always spendingAnd I feel like I'm living the worst day over and over againAnd I feel like the summer is leaving againI feel like I'm living the worst dayI feel like you're goneAnd every day is the worst day everWhoa every day is the worst day everIt's so longI can't go onIt's so longI can't go onAnd I feel like I'm living the worst day over and over againAnd I feel like the summer is leaving againI feel like I'm living the worst dayI feel like you're goneAnd every day is the worst day everWhoa every day is the worst day everOh whoa oh is the worst day ever (3x)
