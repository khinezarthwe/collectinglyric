As I walked alongThe supposed golden pathI was confrontedBy a mysterious specterhe pointed to the graveyardover on yonder hillI paused in cosmic reflectionconfused and wondering.Of how I came to die to die... (to fade)Hmmm I was confusedFor if I was deadhow and why did I die?but I composed myselfand decided I should face himBut I stood paralyzed on the supposed golden path.and I was confrontedby a powerful demon forceand they said it was the deviland when he spoke his words flowed like glowing lavafrom the mouth of a volcanoand I said help me lord ( to fade)I found myself in some kind of hellbut I did not believe in aHeaven-and-hell, world-in-opposite's kind of realityand I gained control of myselfand I decided to press onand as I walked along the supposed golden pathI was trembling with fear all the lions and wizards yet to come.I seen in the distance silver mountains rising high and the cloudsand voice from above did whisper some shining answer from the womb.Please forgive me I never meant to hurt youPlease forgive me I never meant to hurt youPlease forgive me I never meant to hurt youPlease forgive me I never meant to hurt youAs I walked alongPlease forgive me I never meant to hurt youAs I walked alongPlease forgive me I never meant to hurt youPlease forgive me I never meant to hurt youPlease forgive me I never meant to hurt you
