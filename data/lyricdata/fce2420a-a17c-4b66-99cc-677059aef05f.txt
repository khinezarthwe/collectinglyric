Shut your eyes and think of somewhereSomewhere cold and caked in snowBy the fire, we break the quietLearn to wear each other wellAnd when the worrying starts to hurtAnd the world feels like graves of dirtJust close your eyes untilYou can imagine this placeYeah, our secret space, at willShut your eyes, I'll spin the big chairAnd you'll feel dizzy, light and freeAnd falling gently on the cushionYou can come and sing to meAnd when the worrying starts to hurtAnd the world feels like graves of dirtJust close your eyes untilYou can imagine this placeYeah, our secret space, at willShut your eyesShut your eyesShut your eyesShut your eyesShut your eyes and sing to me(Shut your eyes and sing to me)Shut your eyes and sing to me(Shut your eyes and sing to me)Shut your eyes and sing to me(Shut your eyes and sing to me)Shut your eyes and sing to me(Shut your eyes and sing to me)
