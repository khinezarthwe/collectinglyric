One man with our lives in his handsSo much powerAnd so much pressure - is waiting on his commandBrainstormFrom out of the norm, a winning battle planAnd it's out of our handsSo the regiments form(Chorus:)The angel of warUnleashing terrorWho'll throw the first crushing blowWho will decide who has the last laughWho will throw the last blowOne of a kindWho's out of his mindHe who thinks he holds all the answersCan destroy all mankind(Repeat chorus)WarenyHeard cut through the skyFlip of a coin turns heads you will liveLands on tails you will dieNapalmA nuclear bombA flamethrower and a hand grenadeAnd I'm back in Viet Nam(Repeat chorus)
