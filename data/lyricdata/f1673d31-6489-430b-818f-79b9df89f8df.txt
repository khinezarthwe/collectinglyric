I've been waitingAt the back of the chapelI've been here so long I can't feel my fingersNext time we meet, make it somewhere warmAnd baby be on timeLast month, you said you felt you're changingAnd since then I've been all choked upAnd now you're keeping me waitingI can't feel my fingersat the back of the chapelI say a little prayer and I hope you speed upI hope you're on your wayI think about God and I think about moneyAnd I hope you're on your wayI'm losing my feet to the chill from the stoneIt's not just heat and the sun that can riseAt the back of the chapelI can't feel my fingers and I've been here so longI think you're unkind to keep a person waitingEspecially when they've invested love in youAnd when you come you won't feel my fingersCos they get so coldI say a little prayer and I hope you speed upI hope you're on your wayI think about God and I think about moneyAnd I hope you're on your wayI say a little prayer and I hope you speed upI hope you're on your way (back of the chapel, back of the chapel)I think about God and I think about money (back of the chapel, back of the chapel)And I hope you're on your wayI think about God and I think about moneyMoney, money, money, money, money, money
