Well, the mourning was completeThere was tears on the steering wheel, dripping on the seatSeveral hours or several weeksI'd have the cheek to say they're equally as bleakIt's the beginning of the endThe car went up the hill and disappeared around the bendAsk anyone, they'll tell you that it's these times that it tendsTo start to break in halfTo start to fall apartHold on to your heartDo me a favour and break my noseDo me a favour and tell me to go awayDo me a favour and stop asking questionsAnd she walked away while her shoes were untiedAnd the eyes were all red, you could see that we'd criedAnd I watched and I waited till she was insideForcing a smile and waving goodbyeCuriosity becomes a heavy loadToo heavy to holdToo heavy to holdCuriosity becomes a heavy loadToo heavy to holdWill force you to be coldDo me a favour and ask if you need some helpShe said, "Do me a favour and stop flattering yourself"And to tear apart the ties that bindPerhaps "fuck off" might be too kindPerhaps "fuck off" might be too kind
