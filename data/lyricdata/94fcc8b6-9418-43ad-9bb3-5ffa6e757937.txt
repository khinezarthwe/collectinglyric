I wanna be a huge starThat hangs out in hotel barsI wanna wake up at noonIn somebody else's roomI wanna shine so bright it hurtsI wanna be death bed thinNever realize the state I'm inWith my head in the cloudsAnd be followed around by crowdsI wanna shine so bright it hurtsI wanna be high strungMake people wonder what they've doneNo one will talk backCause you'll never knowWhen it might snapI wanna shine so bright it hurtsI wanna shine so bright it hurtsI wanna shine so bright it hurts
