(Music and lyrics: Chris Lykins)Man builds his world, forms it from rock, steel and clayHis view of nature is that it stands in the wayVisions of profit dance in every landlords head13 in two rooms, four in every bed(Chorus:)Man-made paradiseFalls into decayDesperate humansTrapped in their own cageLook out the window not a free to be seenThey just block traffic, man is forced to interveneHiding in darkness, fearing for his lifeMan's lost compassion but has replaced it with a knife(Chorus:)(First solo: Chris)(Second solo: Rick)Desperate children turn to drugs for their funBodies inhabit the morgue claimed by no oneHiding in shadows, their lives reduced to a lieFreedom forgotten, no one hears your cry(Repeat chorus)
