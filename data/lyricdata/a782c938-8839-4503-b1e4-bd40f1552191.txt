We didn't have no where to livewe didn't have nowhere to go'til someone said"I know this place off Burditt Road."It was on the fifteenth floor,it had a board across the door.It took an hour / to pry it off and get inside.It smelt as if someone had died;the living-room was full of flies,the kitchen sink was blocked,the bathroom sink not there at all.Ooh, it's a mess alrightyes it's Mile End.And now we're living in the sky!I'd never thought I'd live so high, just like Heaven(if it didn't look like Hell.)The lift is always full of piss,the fifth floor landing smells of fish(not just on Friday, / every single other day.)Below the kids come out tonight,they kick a ball and have a fightand maybe shoot somebody if they lose at pool.Ooh, it's a mess alright, yes it's Mile End.[mumbled mutterings... you love it...]Oo-ooh  Nobody wants to be your friend'cause you're not from round here,ooh  as if that wassomething to be proud about.The pearly king of the Isle of Dogsfeels up children in the bogs.Down by the playing fields,someone sets a car on fireI guess you have to go right downbefore you understand just how, how low,how low a human being can go.Ooh,it's a mess alright,yes it'sMile End.(don't do that! Leave it out!) / Bababa...Lalala...
