IncalculablyWe shift in our bonesAt our seamsWe’re not what we wereNor are we what we’re going to beSo where does that leave us right nowExcept gloriously unaware of how this will turn outI’ll be careful with youIf you leave your light on for meMy wandering heartIs freer in your proximityAnd if you can’t rely on meThen that makes me exactly half the manThat I’d like to beAnd I don’t wanna let you downNo I don’t wanna let you downSo I’m gonna buy you a house and a dogAnd I’ll try to stick around / we’re gonna settle downSometimes I fearWe are all but corks on the seaSinking by incrementsOr pulled by invisible tides constantlyBut, if our minds can be made up thingsThen that’s what separates usFrom that frightening entropyAnd I’ve tried empathySome crows get the better of meWith my eyes to the skySometimes I feel like flying from hereBut I’d walk on broken glassJust to hold onto some senseOf my own certaintyHold your momentsKeep them in your pockets nowWhen it’s the hoursThat begin to feel like years
