Bed-rest kittens, womb of opiates,Biba dresses, blinking morning sunshine.Can I get an idea? Tell me what did I do?Tell me what did I say? Tell me what did I prove?Time's a frivolous display, both a healer and a bane,I'm in a prism of refractions and burning gamma rays.Are you mourning for an era,When your blood sang and your head trilled?Are you wading a nightmare scape,Over valleys through inkjet lakes?Bed-rest kittens, womb of opiates,Biba dresses, blinking morning sunshine.Can I get an idea? Tell me what did I do?Tell me what did I say? Tell me what did I prove?Time's a frivolous display. Time is a presidential waste.I'm in a prism of refractions and burning gamma rays.Time's a frivolous display, both a healer and a bane,I'm in a prism of refractions and burning gamma rays.Are you mourning for an era,When your blood sang and your head trilled?Are you wading a nightmare scape,Over valleys through inkjet lakes?
