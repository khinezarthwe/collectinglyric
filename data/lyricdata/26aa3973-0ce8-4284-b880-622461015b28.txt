When I was young, I was invincibleI found myself not thinking twiceI never thought about no futureIt's just a roll of the diceBut the day may come when you've got something to loseAnd just when you think you're done paying duesYou say to yourself "Dear God, what have I done?"And hope it's not too late 'cause tomorrow may never comeReach for the sky, 'cause tomorrow may never come.Reach for the sky, 'cause tomorrow may never come.Yesterday is historyAnd tomorrow's a mysteryBut I'm leaving right nowIt's just about how it's you and meYou can run, you can hide just like Bonnie and ClydeReach for the sky; I ain't never gonna dieAnd I thank the Lord for the love that I have foundAnd hold you tight, 'cause tomorrow may never come.Reach for the sky, 'cause tomorrow may never come.Reach for the sky, 'cause tomorrow may never come.So if you please take this momentTry if you can to make it lastDon't think about no futureAnd just forget about the pastAnd make it lastReach for the sky 'cause tomorrow may never come(reach for the sky I ain't never going down)Reach for the sky 'cause tomorrow may never come(reach for the sky I ain't never coming down)Reach for the sky 'cause tomorrow may never come(reach for the sky I ain't never going down)
