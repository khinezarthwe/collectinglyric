Blue skies and brown eyesTulips by the riversideAnd your mind is always lost insideAnd i knew it was youWho had a different point of viewAnd i paid no mindTo the soul i lost insideA web of nightime skiesThe stars went up the mountainsideAnd my music made you feel allrightAnd i knew it was youWho had a different point of viewAnd i paid no mindTo the soul i lost insideThe blue skies and brown eyesTulips by the riversideAnd your mind is always lost in flightAnd i knew it was youWho had a different point of viewI paid no mindTo the soul i lost insideI knew it was youWho had a different point of viewAnd i paid no mindTo the soul i lost insideDo do do do do do do do do do do oooh
