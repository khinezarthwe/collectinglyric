And you'll choke on those wordsNo one can swallow that much prideand my contentions all ring true.Every word you said was a lieand i thought we were friends,but you changed that in time.You're too caught up in the trendswith your ego on the line.You played the role until i called you outand I really hope you listened.I really hope you change things this time.Don't feed me that line.i'm waiting for something that you'll never give.Never again.And this music will endand you'll move on to the next dying trend.You're my fairweather friendand the signals that you send get mixed too easilyAnother day like this could be the end of me.You played the role until i called you outand I really hope you listened.I really hope you change things this time.Don't feed me that line.i'm waiting for something that you'll never give.Never again.You played the role until i called you outand I really hope you listened.I really hope you change things this time.Don't feed me that line.i'm waiting for something that you'll never give.Never again.
