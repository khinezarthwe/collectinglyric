It's a speedway flowing in the veinsAnd I feel alive oh yeahWhen the pilots are just about to cryI drive fasterMy life on the speedwayMy hands on the steering wheelRisk of racing in my eyesAs fast as a cannonballEngines like a rock'n'rollYellow moonlight in the skyPush and never look backPush and never give up tonight people sayAll my energy and all my knowledgeAre yelling loud into my brainOn my speedwayIn the pouring rainI want to survive oh yeahWhen the pilots are about to dieI like pushingIt's a speedway flowing in the veinsAnd I feel alive oh yeahWhen the pilots are just about to cryI drive fasterFriends are waiting for me thereWith no chances to know whereI will suddenly come fromSilent people at the beatPray the Lord to drive me neatAnd to lead me safe back homePush and never look backPush and never give up tonight people sayAll my energy and all my knowledgeAre yelling loud into my brainOn my speedwayIn the pouring rainI want to survive oh yeahWhen the pilots are about to dieI like pushingIt's a speedway flowing in the veinsAnd I feel alive oh yeahWhen the pilots are just about to cryI drive faster
