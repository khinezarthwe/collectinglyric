Standing on the shore watching our ship go downSinking in the sand and I can't turn aroundFuture's looking black and it's a sight to seeJust a thousand grey waves crashing over meJust a thousand grey waves breaking over meNow it's happening to me, why can't I ever see?Am I gonna let you leave without a sound?Watching 'til you're out of sightDreaming I did something right standing on my own againWater in my lungs and it's a pain to breatheSalt is in my eyes and it's a pain to seeI can't stand the pressure though you think I canJust don't wanna see it going down the panJust don't wanna see it going down the panNow it's happening to me, why can't I ever see?Am I gonna let you leave without a sound?Pushing you to your wit's endGuess I'm gonna lose a friend standing on my own againNow it's happening to me, why can't I ever see?Am I gonna let you leave without a sound?Watching 'til you're out of sightDreaming I did something right standing on my own again
