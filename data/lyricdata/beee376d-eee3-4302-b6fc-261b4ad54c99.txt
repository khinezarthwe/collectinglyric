I never meant to be so bad to youOne thing I said that I would never doA look from you and I would fall from graceAnd that would wipe this smile right from my faceDo you remember when we used to dance?And incidence arose from circumstance?One thing led to another we were youngAnd we would scream together songs unsungIt was the heat of the momentTelling you what my heart meantThe heat of the moment showed in your eyesAnd now you find yourself in '82The disco hotspots hold no charm for youYou can't concern yourself with bigger thingsYou catch a pearl and ride the dragon's wings'Cause it's the heat of the momentThe heat of the momentThe heat of the moment showed in your eyesAnd when your looks are gone and you're aloneHow many nights you sit beside the phoneWhat were the things you wanted for yourself?Teenage ambitions you'll remember wellIt was the heat of the momentTelling you what your heart meantThe heat of the moment showed in your eyesIt was the heat of the momentThe heat of the momentHeat of the moment showed in your eyesHeat of the momentHeat of the momentHeat of the momentHeat of the momentThe heat of the moment
