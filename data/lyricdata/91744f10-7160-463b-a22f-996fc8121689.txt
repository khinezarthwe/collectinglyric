As the signs grow strongerAnd our fate clearerTake no precautionsFollow your leaderAs our love grows deeperAnd we fill each otherStill admire the darknessLet it become largerAs life drifts furtherOur beauty is the coreAlways sighing afterStill I crave moreAs hope alone grows higherIt struggles to be freeAll that we can beFall...demise...allWe're...disguised...goneWeep together the rain to comeFeel at heart, the pain is gone
