She seems dressed in all the ringsOf past fatalitiesSo fragile yet so deviousShe continues to seeClimatic hands that pressHer temples and my chestEnter the night that she came homeForeverShe's the only one that makes me sad(Please, get away, get away, get away!)She is everything and moreThe solemn hypnoticMy dahlia bathed in possessionShe is home to meI get nervous, perverseWhen I see her, it's worseBut the stress is astoundingIt's now or neverShe's coming homeForeverShe's the only one that makes me sad(My imagination come alive)Hard to say what caught my attentionFixed and crazyAphid attractionCarve my name in my faceTo recognizeSuch a pheromone cultTo terrorizeI won't let this build up inside of meYeah!I'm a slave andI am a masterNo restraints andUnchecked collectorsI exist through my needTo self-obligeShe is something in meThat I despiseI won't let this build up inside of meShe isn't real; I can't make her realShe isn't real; I can't make herReal!
