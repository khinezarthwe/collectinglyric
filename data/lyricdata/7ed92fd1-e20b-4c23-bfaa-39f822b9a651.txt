Heifer whines could be human criesCloser comes the screaming knifeThis beautiful creature must dieThis beautiful creature must dieA death for no reasonAnd death for no reason is murderAnd the flesh you so fancifully fryIs not succulent, tasty or kindIt's death for no reasonAnd death for no reason is murderAnd the calf that you carve with a smileIt is murderAnd the turkey you festively sliceIt is murderDo you know how animals die?Kitchen aromas aren't very homelyIt's not comforting, cheery or kindIt's sizzling blood and the unholy stench of murderIt's not natural, normal or kindThe flesh you so fancifully fryThe meat in your mouthAs you savour the flavour of murderNo No No - It is MurderNo No No - It is MurderAnd who hears when animals cry?
