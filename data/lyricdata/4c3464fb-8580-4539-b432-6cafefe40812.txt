Now you're goneI wonder why you left me hereI think about it on and on and on and on and on againI know you're never coming backI hope that you can hear meI'm waiting to hear from youUntil I doYou're gone awayI'm left aloneA part of me is goneAnd I'm not moving onSo wait for meI know the day will comeI'll meet you thereNo matter where life takes me toI'll meet you thereAnd even if I need you hereI'll meet you thereI wish I could have told youThe things I kept insideBut now I guess it's just too lateSo many things remind me of youI hope that you can hear meI miss youThis is goodbyeOne last timeYou're gone awayI'm left aloneA part of me is goneAnd I'm not moving onSo wait for meI know the day will comeI'll meet you thereNo matter where life takes me toI'll meet you thereand even if I need you hereI'll meet you there(x's 2)And where I go you'll be there with meForever you'll be right here with meI'll meet you thereNo matter where life takes me toI'll meet you thereand even if I need youI'll meet you there(x's 2)
