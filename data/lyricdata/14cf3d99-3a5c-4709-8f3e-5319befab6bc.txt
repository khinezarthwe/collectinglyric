Now here's a little story I gots to tellAbout three bad brothers you know so wellIt started way back in historyWith Ad-Rock, MCA and me, Mike D.I  had a little horsey named Paul RevereJust me and my horsey and a quart of beerRidin' cross the land, kickin' up sandSheriff's posse's on my tail 'cause I'm in demandOne lonely Beastie I beAll by myself without nobodyThe sun is beatin' down on my baseball hatThe air is gettin' hot, the beer is gettin' flatLookin' for a girl, I ran into a guyHis name is MCA, I said "howdy", he said "hi."He told a little story that sounded well rehearsedFour days on the run and that he's dying of thirstThe brew was in my hand, and he was on my tipHis voice was hoarse, his throat was dry, he asked me for a sipHe said "Can I get some?"I said "You can't get none."I had a chance to run,but he pulled out his shotgun.Quick on the draw, I thought I'd be dead.He put the gun to my head and this is what he said"Now, my name is MCA, I got a license to kill.I think you know what time it is, it's time to get ill.So what do we have here? An outlaw and his beer.I run this land, you understand, I've made myself clear."We stepped into the wind, he had a gun, I had a grinAs if this story's over, but it's ready to beginI said, "I'll ride with you if you can get me to the border.The Sheriff is after me for what I did to his daughter.I did it like this, I did it like that.I did it with the whiffle ball bat.So I'm on the run, the cop's got my gun.And right about now it's time to have some fun.The King Ad-Rock, that is my name,and I know the fly spot where they got the champagne."We rode for six hours then we hit the spotThe beat was-a-bumpin' and the girlies was hotThis dude was starin' like he knows who we areWe took the empty spot next to him at the barMCA said "Yo, you know this kid?"I said I didn't but I knew he didThe kid said, "Get ready, cuz this ain't funny.My name is Mike D and I'm about to get money."He pulled out the jammy, aimed it at the sky.He yelled, "Stick 'em up!" And let two fly.Hands went up and people hit the floor.He wasted two kids that ran for the door."I'm Mike D and I get respect.Your cash and your jewelry is what I expect."MCA what with it, and he's my ace,So I grabbed the piano player and punched him in the faceThe piano player's out, the music stoppedThis boy had beef, and he got dropped.Mike D grabbed the money, MCA snatched the gold.I grabbed two girlies and a beer that's cold.
