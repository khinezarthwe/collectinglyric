I was standing by the NileWhen I saw the lady smileI would take her for a whileFor a whileLike tears wept like a childHow her golden hair was blowing wildThen she spread her wings to flyFor to flySoaring high above the breezesGoing always where she pleasesShe will make it to the island in the SunI will follow in her shadowAnd I'll watch her from my windowOne day I will catch her eyeShe is calling from the deepSummoning my soul to endless sleepShe is bound to drag me downDrag me down
