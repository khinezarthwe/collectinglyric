Can you tell the difference, between the pebble and the boy,Far away in the distance, with the sun in your eyes,Can you see the footprints, that have merged with the sand,And you're trying to find them, you find only dry land.Can you tell the difference, between the pebble and the boy,Can you follow the heartbeats between the boy and the man,If you can, if you can.Can the future, with every step you take,yet you feel your no further, and your walking away,Can you tell the difference between the pepple and the manFar away in the ocean, with his back on dry sand.Can you tell the difference, between the pepple and the boy,Can you follow the heartbeats between the boy and the man,If you can, if you can.
