Like a piece of the air, it's just how you feelAre you really there? Are you even real?I don't know which way to go when I hear you everywhereThere's a melody in every line and a sorrow in these eyes of mineIf a diamond hangs in every treeAnd a life is lost for every leaf, can a bird still sing?I listened just this morning, this is what I heardAn angel's wings in cool night air like a blackbird in the chapelA starling in the moonlight fair wings beating up a galeIn the morning, in the morning, in the morning, ooh, in the morningYou're a part of the air and you shake a whole fieldWith your golden hair and your golden shieldI don't know which way to go when I hear you everywhereThere's a melody in every line and a sorrow in these eyes of mineIf a diamond hangs in every treeAnd a life is lost for every leaf, can a bird still sing?I listened just this morning, this is what I heardAn angel's wings in cool night air like a blackbird in the chapelA starling in the moonlight fair wings beating up a galeIn the morning, in the morning, in the morning, ooh, in the morningLike a piece of the air, it's just how you feelJust hovering there, are you even real?I don't know which way to go when I hear you everywhereThere's a melody in every line and a sorrow in these eyes of mineIf a diamond hangs in every treeAnd a life is lost for every leaf, can a bird still sing?I listened just this morning, this is what I heardAn angel's wings in cool night air like a blackbird in the hailStarlings in the moonlight fair wings beating up a galeLegless owl in endless flight, unable for to settleIn oceans like a giants mind harbouring it's mettleIn the morning, in the morning, in the morning, ooh, in the morning
