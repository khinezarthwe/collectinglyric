Who let you go? Who let you go?Who let you go? Who let you go?Who let you go? Who let you go?Who let you go? Who let you go?I feel it inside, down in my soulAnd I just can't hide these things I knowWe could be friendsAnd I promise that it won't go badBut hopefully this story endsBut you ain't got nothing I never hadSo let's take it slowWho let you go? Who let you go?Who let you go? Who let you go?Someone must have loved youNot the way that I doYou're missing what I'm trying to sayAin't nothing getting in my waySo tell me that's fantasticAnd promise me, you'll always sighI find it so romanticWhen you look into my beautiful eyesAnd lose controlWho let you go? Who let you go?Who let you go? Who let you go?Who let you go? Who let you go?Who let you go? Who let you go?I don't know what it meansBut I've been wonderingWho let you go?And honey, when you walk my wayIt makes me wanna sayOhSha la la la, sha la la laSha la la la, sha la, la la la la laSha la la la, sha la la laSha la la la, sha la, la la la la laSha la la la, sha la la laSha la la la, sha la, la la la la laSha la la la, sha la la laSha la la la, sha la, la la la la la
