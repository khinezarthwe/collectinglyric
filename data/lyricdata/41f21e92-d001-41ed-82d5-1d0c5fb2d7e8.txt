You never cried, you never frozeAnd yet how well your garden grows -You reap the fruits another sows;I guess that works out well for you.Suffering has served you well -It's common yet it somehow sellsSo sing your little songs of hell and sell.Hollow hopes and empty dreamsAnd blind pursuit of worthless schemes -That's all there is to life, it seems,unless you prove me wrong - please do!
