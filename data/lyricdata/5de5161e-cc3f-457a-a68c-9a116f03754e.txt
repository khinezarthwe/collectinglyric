Overhead the albatross hangs motionless upon the airAnd deep beneath the rolling wavesIn labyrinths of coral cavesThe echo of a distant timeComes willowing across the sandAnd everything is green and submarineAnd no-one showed us to the landAnd no-one knows the wheres or whysBut something stirs and something triesNow starts to climb towards the lightStrangers passing in the streetBy chance two separate glances meetAnd I am you and what I see is meAnd do I take you by the handAnd lead you through the landAnd help me understand the best I canAnd no-one calls us to move onAnd no-one forces down our eyesNo-one speaks and no-one triesNo-one flies around the sunCloudless everyday you fall upon my waking eyesInviting and inciting me to riseAnd through the window in the wallCome streaming in on sunlight wingsA million bright ambassadors of morningAnd no-one sings me lullabiesAnd no-one makes me close my eyesSo I throw the windows wideAnd call to you across the sky
