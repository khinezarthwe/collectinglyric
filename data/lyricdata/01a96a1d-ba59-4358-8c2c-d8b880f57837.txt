Raise a glass nowTo the personWho invented the word called scumHe was cleverNever foolishAnd he knew where you came fromYou’re a bumbagAnd a vexerAnd you never let your standards slipCause your standardsAre so low-downLike the pavement you find when you tripBut I won’t trip overLook over my shoulderYou won’t get the better of meThe credit you owe meRespect you don’t show meAll makes the better for meYou look so good from afarBut you’re just a bumbagYes, you areYou’re a parasiteYou’re a virusYou only ever make mistakesLike a leperOr a tapewormYou only ever seem to takeNow you’re livin’With your languageAnd everyone’s avoiding youAsk for moneyAsk for cigarettesBut it’s all you ever seem to doBut I won’t trip overLook over my shoulderYou won’t get the better of meThe credit you owe meRespect you don’t show meAll makes the better for meYou look so good from afarBut you’re just a bumbagYes, you areAll my friend’s headsSeem to go downWhenever you decide to turn upFeel so sorryFor your parentsWhen they see your face, they must spew upYou’re the black sheepYou’re the distanceYou should keep your wits about you in townBecause one dayIt could kill youAnd your body never will be found
