Angel come on down from heaven yesterdayStayed with me just long enough to rescue meAnd she told me a story yesterdayAbout the love between the moon and the deep blue seaThen she spread her wings high above meAnd she said she gonna come back tomorrowAnd I saidFly on, my sweet angelFly on through the skyFly on, my sweet angelTomorrow I will be right by your sideSure enough, this woman came home to meSilver wings silhouette against a child's own prizeOh angel, she said unto meToday is the day for you to riseTake my hand, take my handYou're gonna riseAnd then, she took me high over yonderAnd I saidFly on, my sweet angelFly on through the skyFly on, my sweet angelForever I will be right by your side
