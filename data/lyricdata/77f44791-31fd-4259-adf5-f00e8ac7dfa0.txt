I scattered picturesOn the bedroom floorI should have told youSo many times beforeI should have listenedWhen you were mineIt could be too lateI've already crossed the lineMy angelWhen you are whispering in my earYou have nothing to fearYou have nothing to fearYou've always been hereBy my sideI even felt youWhen the earth began to slideMy angelMy angelYou have nothing to fear
