The north star always guides meWhen winter skies are greyAnd I wait for the sun when all are oneI shall not betrayCalling at meI'm waiting when all are led astrayCarry on my songs foreverCarry on when I am goneCarry on when the day is longForever carry onFor as long as we're togetherThen forever carry onDarkness all around usWe don't close our eyesNo one's gonna ground usWe were born to flyComin' at us, no stoppingBorn to amplifyCarry on my songs foreverCarry on when I am goneCarry on when the day is longForever carry onFor as long as we're togetherThen forever carry onYeah, be my brotherFight to stay aliveAll the world can't change usWith all their burned-out jiveCome get us, now we're waitingWe won't run and hideCarry on my songs foreverCarry on when I am goneCarry on when the day is longForever carry onFor as long as we're togetherThen forever carry onNow we're all togetherLet's sing a fighting songOne hundred thousand ridersWe can't all be wrongComin' at us, no stoppingAlways carry onCarry on my songs foreverCarry on when I am goneCarry on when the day is longForever carry onFor as long as we're togetherThen forever carry on
