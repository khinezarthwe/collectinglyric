My head is saying noBut my heart keeps giving inSo hard to let it goWhen it's there under my skinWell if this is the face of a sinnerAnd if heaven was only for winnersWell I don't care -'Cause I won't know anybody thereThought that I'd let it slideBut it's me that's slipping inThought that I'd go for a rideBefore this crash I'm dying inrefrain:Well if I'm judged on the life I've been livingAnd if heaven is not soul forgivingWell I don't care -'Cause I won't know anybody thereI don't care, 'cause I won't knowAnybody thereMy head is saying noBut my heart keeps giving inIt's so hard to let it goWhen it's there under my skinrefrain:I don't care, 'cause I won't knowAnybody thereIs there anybody there?
