Why can't we be togetherCan't you love me, don't hate meI don't see why can't we live togetherBaby we can get it onMaybe we can get alongAssure me, oh destinyThere's a cold streak living inside usThere's no rainbows, just bullets and bonesAnd if you wanna rise upWe can make this hate stopNow, don't you wanna rise up?We've been giving hate a chanceWe got all this love to give, you knowAnd my love will be running out for usCan't you feel that there's a lifeThat hope that we can still surviveAs the wind carries every different waySo why do we see these coloursIt's only skin deep, don't mean a thingSo clear, I don't need this with or othersCan't you see its killing usCan't you see its killing usCan't you see its killing meTrigger happy fantasiesSo stand up and be so strong nowFreedom is not so far awayIf you know you wanna rise upWe can make this hate stopNow, don't you wanna rise up?We've been giving hate a chanceWe got all this love to give you knowAnd my love will be running out for usCan't you feel that there's a lifeThat hope that we can still surviveAs the wind carries every different wayThe wind carries every different wayThe wind carries every different wayEvery different wayNow you've been takingOur dignity for too longI want to save this certainty that we holdAnd who's right and who's wrongWe're not so different anywayWords are in this songCan't we stop the fighting? 'causeWe've been giving hate a chanceWe got all this love to give you knowAnd my love will be running out for usCan't you feel that there's a lifeThat hope that we can still surviveAs the wind carries every different wayDon't give this hate a chanceWe got all this love to give, you knowAnd this tree of life will still surviveUntil no more people have to cryI say, don't give this hate a chanceWe got all this love to give, you knowAnd this tree of life will still surviveUntil no more people have to cryI say, don't give this hate a chanceWe got all this love to give, you knowAnd this tree of life will still surviveUntil no more people have to cry
