Whenever I step outsideSomebody claims to see the lightIt seems to me that all of us have lost our patienceCause everyone thinks they're rightAnd nobody thinks that there just mightBe more than one road to our final destinationBut I'm not ever gonna know if I'm right or wrongCause we're all going in the same directionAnd I'm not sure which way to goBecause all along, we've been going in the same directionI'm tired of playing gamesOf looking for someone else to blameFor all the holes in answers that are clearly showingFor something to fill the spaceWas all of the time I spent a wasteCause so many choices point the same way I was goingBut I'm not ever gonna know if I'm right or wrongCause we're all going in the same directionAnd I'm not sure which way to goBecause all along, we've been going in the same directionGoing in the same directionSame direction (same direction)So why does there only have to be one correct philosophy?I don't wanna go and follow you just to end up like one of themAnd why are you always telling me what you want me to believe?I'd like to think that I canGo my own way and meet you in the endGo my own way and meet you in the endI'm not ever gonna know if I'm right or wrongCause we're all going in the same directionAnd I'm not sure which way to goBecause all along, we've been going in the same directionGoing in the same directionGoing in the same directionSame direction (same direction)
