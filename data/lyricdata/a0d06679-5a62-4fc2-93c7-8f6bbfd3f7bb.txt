Lost in the skyClouds roll by and I roll with themArrows flySeas increase and then fall againThis world is spinning around me andThis world is spinning without me andEvery day sends future to pastEvery breath leaves me one less to my lastWatch the sparrow fallingGives new meaning to it allIf not today nor yet tomorrowThen some other dayI'll take seven lives for oneAnd then my only father's sonAs sure as I did ever love himI am not afraidThis world is spinning around me andThe whole world keeps spinning around me andAll life is future to pastEvery breath leaves me one less to my lastPull me underPull me underPull me under I'm not afraidAll that I feel is honor and spiteAll I can do is set it rightDust fills my eyesClouds roll by and I roll with themCenturies cryOrders fly and I fall againThis world is spinning inside meThe whole world is spinning inside meEvery day sends future to pastEvery step brings me closer to my lastPull me underPull me underPull me under I'm not afraidLiving my life too much in the sunOnly until your will is donePull me underPull me underPull me under I'm not afraidAll that I feel is honor and spiteAll I can do is set it rightPull me underPull me underPull me under I'm not afraidLiving my life too much in the sunOnly until your will is doneOh that this too,Too solid flesh would melt
