Everybody wants to be a showmanYeah they all got another oneEverybody think they got a geniusEverybody got me on the runSometimes I think they come hereJust so you can say that you canAnd I can't get alone in my bathroomI need to give myself a handY'all cuh-cuh-cuh-creepin'Creepin' underneath my skinFuck you and your flashbulbsSnappin' my picture againYou drink all my whiskeyYou steal all my smokeAnd you're crowded all around meLike I got nowhere to go(Chorus) Eyes are gonna rollBeggin' me to killTime for you to goI'm-a-gon' spillIt ain't yo fast trainI'll be the king runnin' at the wheelI ain't lookin' to make no deals here noYou keep stickin' to me like a prickly porcupineYou're gettin' your information from the grocery checkout lineAre ya true confessin' of your little girl obsessionCuz I was only messin', an' I had a little timeChorus... Chorus X2
