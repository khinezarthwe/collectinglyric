Don't let them take it away, Mama saidKeep it down, down, down, put it awayHow could I roam in the song, ohWhen the words come and goEvery time I hear your song, you fade awayHow I've tried for so, so long then you will stayNow nobody can see, see what it meansWhat it means to you to me and IDon't let it fade away, fade awayTo the other side, oh yesterdayEvery time I hear your song, you fade awayHow I've tried for so, so long then you will stayEvery time I hear your songEvery time, every time, your song
