You won't hear me, but you'll feel meWithout warning, something's dawning, listenThen within your sensesYou'll know you're defenselessHow your heart beats when you run for coverYou can't retreat, I spy like no otherThen we race togetherWe can ride foreverWrapped in horsepower, driving into furyChanging gear, I pull you tighter to meI'm your turbo loverTell me there's no otherI'm your turbo loverBetter run for coverWe hold each other closer as we shift to overdriveAnd everything goes rushing by with every nerve aliveWe move so fast it seems as though we've taken to the skyLove machines in harmony, we hear the engines cryI'm your turbo loverTell me there's no otherI'm your turbo loverBetter run for coverOn and on, we're charging to the place so many seekIn perfect synchronicity of which so many speakWe feel so close to heaven in this roaring heavy loadAnd then in sheer abandonment, we shatter and explodeI'm your turbo loverTell me there's no otherI'm your turbo loverBetter run for coverI'm your turbo loverTell me there's no otherI'm your turbo loverBetter run for cover
