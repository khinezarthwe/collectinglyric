I don't remember how it started, I don't know how it endsWorld keeps turnin' makin' me dizzy, feels like I blew it againWhen I was young they told me this would be easyWhen times got tough they were changin' their tuneThey should of told me that they were teas'nWhen they promised the moonI walked through all the doors, read all the signsFelt I had nothin' to loseEach of us you know we've got our own problemsWe wear the same kind of shoesWhen we were young they told us this would be easyWhen times got tough they were changin' their tuneThey should of told us that they were teas'nWhen they promised moonWhy do they lieWhy do they promise you can touch the skyWhy do they lieWhy do they promise the moonWhy do they promise the moon
