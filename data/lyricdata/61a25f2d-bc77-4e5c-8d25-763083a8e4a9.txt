Now there's a girl about town I'd like to knowI'd like to slip away with youAnd if you said you love me how could I mind?Is there another side to everything you do?Take in the country airYou'll never winGentlemen take polaroidsThey fall in love they fall in loveGentlemen take polaroidsThey fall in love they fall in loveBreathe life into meSpin me roundAnd I'll just sit and wonder whyJust a foreign town with a foreign mindWhy is everything so cut and dried?The taste of country air you'll never knowGentlemen take polaroidsThey fall in love they fall in loveGentlemen take polaroidsThey fall in love they fall in loveTake in the country, ah you'll never winGentlemen take polaroidsThey fall in love they fall in loveGentlemen take polaroidsThey fall in love they fall in love
