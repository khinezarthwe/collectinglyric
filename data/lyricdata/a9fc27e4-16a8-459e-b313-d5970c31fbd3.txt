I let the beast in too soonI don't know how to live without my hand on his throatI fight him always and stillOh darling it's so sweetYou think you know how crazyHow crazy I amYou say you don't spook easyYou won't go, but I knowAnd I pray that you willFast as you canBaby run, free yourself of meFast as you canI may be soft in your palmBut I'll soon grow hungry for a fightAnd I will not let you winMy pretty mouth will frame the phrases that willDisprove your faith in manSo if you catch me trying to find my way into yourHeart from under your skinFast as you canBaby scratch me out, free yourselfFast as you canFast as you canBaby scratch me out, free yourselfFast as you canSometimes my mind don't shake and shiftBut most of the time, it doesAnd I get to the place where I'm begging for a liftOr I'll drown in the wonders and the wasAnd I'll be your girl if you say it's a giftAnd you give me some more of your drugsYeah, I'll be your pet if you just tell me it's a giftCause I'm tired of whys choking on whys,Just need a little because becauseI let the beast in and thenI even tried forgiving him but it's too soonSo I'll fight again, again, again, again, againAnd for a little while moreI'll soar the uneven windComplain and blame the sterile landBut if you're getting any bright ideas, quiet dearI'm blooming withinFast as you canBaby wait watch me, I'll be outFast as I canMaybe late but at least aboutFast as you canLeave me, let this thing run its routeFast as you can...
