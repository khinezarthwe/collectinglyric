9am again in the morningI've got my things to doI cannot let myself be weakI cannot cry myself to sleepIn the morning I forget I'm missing youBut somehow at 10 in the morningI tell myself I'm fineI cannot let myself be weakI cannot cry myself to sleepIn the morning it's much easier to lieIt's at night when I've gotNothing else to doIt's at night I go outHoping I'll find youAnd I wonder who you'reWith in the morningI'm sure you're not aloneBut I can't let myself be weakI cannot cry myself to sleepIn the morning I can't sit hereBy the phoneIt's at night when I've gotNothing else to doIt's at night I go outHoping I'll find you
