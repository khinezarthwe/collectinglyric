Happiness hit her like a train on a trackComing towards her, stuck still, no turning backShe hid around corners and she hid under bedsShe killed it with kisses and from it she fledWith every bubble she sank with a drinkAnd washed it away down the kitchen sinkThe dog days are overThe dog days are doneThe horses are comingSo you better runRun fast for your mother, run fast for your fatherRun for your children, for your sisters and brothersLeave all your love and your longing behindYou can't carry it with you if you want to surviveThe dog days are over, ohThe dog days are doneCan you hear the horses?'Cause here they comeAnd I never wanted anything from youExcept everything you had and what was left after that, too, ohHappiness a-hit her like a bullet in the backStruck from a great height by someone who should've known better than thatThe dog days are overThe dog days are doneCan you hear the horses?'Cause here they comeRun fast for your mother, run fast for your fatherRun for your children, for your sisters and brothersLeave all your love and your longing behindYou can't carry it with you if you want to surviveThe dog days are over, ahThe dog days are doneCan you hear the horses?'Cause here they comeHere they comeHere they comeHere they come
