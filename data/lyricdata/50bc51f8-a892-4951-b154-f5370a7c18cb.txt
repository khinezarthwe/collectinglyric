Picked a girl up at the trainstop where I liveTook a drive along the beach by the oceanTalk about the dreams we had while we were growing oldWrote a poem on the back of your shoulderTell me your name, tell me your storyCause I'm into it, runnin' through life like a misfitTell me your name, tell me your storyCause I'm into it, runnin' through life like a misfitI will start againI will start againGive the dog a bone to chew as I drive aroundWrote this song last night while I was soberTell me your name, tell me your storyCause I'm into it, runnin' through life like a misfitTell me your name, tell me a storyCause I'm into it, runnin' through life like a misfitAnd I kept on drivingI will startI will startI will star-ar-artI will start againI will startI will startI will star-ar-artI will start againTell me your name, tell me your storyCause I'm into it, runnin' through life like a misfitTell me your name, tell me a storyCause I'm into it, runnin' through life like a misfit
