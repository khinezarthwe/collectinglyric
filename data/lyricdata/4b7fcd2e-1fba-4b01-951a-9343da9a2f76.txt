(You know you're not the only one)When they all come crashing down- midflightYou know you're not the only oneWhen they're so alone they find a back door out of lifeYou know you're not the only oneWe're all grievingLost and bleedingAll our livesWe've been waitingFor someone to call our leaderAll your liesNot believingHeaven shine a light down on meSo afraid to open your eyes- hypnotizedYou know you're not the only oneNever understood this lifeAnd you're right, I don't deserveBut you know I'm not the only oneWe're all grievingLost and bleedingAll our livesWe've been waitingFor someone to call our leaderAll your liesI'm not believingHeaven shine a light down on meDon't look downDon't look into the eyes of the world beneath youDon't look downYou'll fall downYou'll become their sacrificeRight or wrongCan't hold on to the fear that I'm lost without youIf I can't feel, I'm not mineI'm not realAll our livesWe've been waitingFor someone to call our leaderAll your liesNot believingHeaven shine a light down on me
