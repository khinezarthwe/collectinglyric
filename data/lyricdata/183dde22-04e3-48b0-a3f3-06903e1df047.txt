(Instrumental)I remember a timeMy frail, virgin mindWatched the crimson sunriseImagined what it might findLife was filled with wonderI felt the warm wind blowI must explore the boundariesTranscend the depth of winter's snowInnocence caressing meI never felt so young beforeThere was so much life in meStill I longed to search for moreBut those days are gone nowChanged like a leaf on a treeBlown away foreverInto the cool autumn breezeThe snow has now fallenAnd my sun's not so brightI struggle to hold onWith the last of my mightIn my den of inequityViciousness and subtletyStruggle to ease the painStruggle to find the saneIgnorance surrounding meI've never been so filled with fearAll my life's been drained from meThe end is drawing near..."Carpe diem, seize the day"I'll always rememberThe chill of NovemberThe news of the fallThe sounds in the hallThe clock on the wall ticking away"Seize the Day"I heard him sayLife will not always be this wayLook aroundHear the soundsCherish your life while you're still around"Gather ye rosebuds while ye may,Old Time is still a-flying;And this same flower that smiles today,Tomorrow will be dying."(Sample is James Waterston from the film "Dead Poet's Society". From the poem "To The Virgins, To Make Much Of Time" by Robert Herrick.)We can learn from the pastBut those days are goneWe can hope for the futureBut there may not be oneThe words stuck in my mindAlive from what I've learnedI have to seize the dayTo home I returnedPreparing for her flightI held with all my mightFearing my deepest frightShe walked into the nightShe turned for one last lookShe looked me in the eyeI said, "I love you... Goodbye""It's the most awful thing you'llEver hear.""If you're lying to me...""Oh, you dearly love her.""... Just have to leave... all our lives.""Seize the day!""Something happened.""Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.""She was killed."(Various samples mainly John Voight from the film "Table For Five", some are from the film "Dead Poet's Society".)(Instrumental)So far or so it seemsAll is lost with nothing fulfilledOff the pages and the TV screenAnother world where nothing's trueTripping through the life fantasticLose a step and never get upLeft alone with a cold blank stareI feel like giving upI was blinded by a paradiseUtopia high in the skyA dream that only drowned meDeep in sorrow, wondering whyOh come let us adore himAbuse and then ignore himNo matter what, don't let him beLet's feed upon his miseryThen string him up for all the world to seeI'm sick of all you hypocritesHolding me at bayAnd I don't need your sympathyTo get me through the daySeasons change and so can IHold on boy, no time to cryUntie these strings, I'm climbing downI won't let them push me awayOh come let us adore himAbuse and then ignore himNo matter what, don't let him beLet's feed upon his miseryNow it's time for them to deal with me(Instrumental)I'm much wiser nowA lifetime of memoriesRun through my headThey taught me howFor better or worse, alive or deadI realize there's no turning backLife goes on the offbeaten trackI sit down with my sonSet to see the crimson sunset(Gather ye rosebuds while ye may)Many years have come and goneI've lived my life, but now must move on(Gather ye rosebuds while ye may)He's my only oneNow that my time has comeNow that my life is doneWe look into the sun"Seize the day and don't you cryNow it's time to say goodbyeEven though I'll be goneI will live on, live on."
