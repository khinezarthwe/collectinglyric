Hang me up on your wall, above the coal fireKeep your promises, keep your promisesHang me up on your wallYou're such a cold liar, do what your father saysWhat your father saysI still remember your voice, it turns my blood coldThe kids are fast asleep, keep them fast asleepYour soul still haunts these walls, like TaxidermyThere's no kiss of life's, no baby don't pretendWith your heart in your throat and a gun to your headYou can burn the money in the fireplaceYou keep on telling white lies to the little kidsI think it's time they knew just what it means to liveYou can burn your parents in the fireplaceI saw you run from the cold, out of my armsYour mother cried for years, she cried for yearsI saw you run through the cold, put ice in my heartNow tell me all your fears, I'll be your greatest fearYou couldn't cut the smile from my faceCause we're so proud today, we're so proud todayOur eyes will haunt these walls, like TaxidermyThere's no kiss of life's, no baby don't pretendWith your heart in your throat and a gun to your headYou can burn the money in the fireplaceYou keep on telling white lies to the little kidsI think it's time they knew just what it means to liveNow burn your parents in the fireplace
