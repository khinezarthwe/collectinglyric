This is something I can't handle, I wish I had your strength.Just one ounce, just one ounce would make me warm again.Lessons in the wind.Time's cold hand affects me and bleeds me dry.I am beaten until my eyes are swollen shut.Carry the weight of your time, still moving.Standing up straight while confined, still proving.Swallowed by humility.Fear the new change coming.Still afraid to let it be, facing lifes uncertainty.Take the new change running.Only fear, comformity will change you!
