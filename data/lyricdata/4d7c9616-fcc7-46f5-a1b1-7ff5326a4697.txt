Pull the blindfold downSo your eyes can't seeNow run as fast as you canThrough this field of treesSay goodbye to everyoneYou have ever knownYou are not gonna see them ever againI can't shake this feeling I've gotMy dirty hands, have I been in the wars?The saddest thing that I'd ever seenWere smokers outside the hospital doorsSomeone turn me aroundCan I start this again?How can we wear our smilesWith our mouths wide shut'Cause you stopped us from singingI can't shake this feeling I've gotMy dirty hands, have I been in the wars?The saddest thing that I'd ever seenWere smokers outside the hospital doorsSomeone turn me aroundCan I start this again?Now someone turn us aroundCan we start this again?We've all been changedFrom what we wereOur broken heartsLeft smashed on the floorI can't believe youIf I can't hear youI can't believe youIf I can't hear youWe've all been changedFrom what we wereOur broken heartsSmashed on the floorWe've all been changedFrom what we wereOur broken heartsSmashed on the floorSomeone turn me around(We've all been changed from what we were)Can I start this again?(Our broken hearts smashed on the floor)Now someone turn us around(We've all been changed from what we were)Can we start this again?(Our broken hearts smashed on the floor)
