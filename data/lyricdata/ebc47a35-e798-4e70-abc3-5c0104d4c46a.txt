Pour the emerald wineInto crystal glassesWe will touch the divineThrough kisses catharsisLet us pitch to the seven-year itchOf the ultra-decadentTo a tainted world and the painted girlsThat our fantasies spentTripping through boudoirs laced with opiate themesSipping the bizarre, tasting copious dreamsA toast to those most sacrilegious of daysWhere for every whim wonOne soon repaysWe touched the starsThat now laugh from afarAt we, the damnedThe damnedThe damnedThe damnedWe have spent our timeDrenched in opulent splendourBut when midnight chimesWill gilded souls surrender?Let us drink on the giddying brinkOf pools of excrementAll manner of shit for the glamour and glitzMephistopheles lentI remember the night as if it were engravedA bright marble bridge stretched across the dark wavesTo the shore from the moon and by her graceCame that erudite strangerThat fuckerHe was a predator, creditor coldOur blood was shed on the yellowing scrollAnd all that glittered was not goldBut we wanted everythingAnd for it all, lost our soulsCome my friend, to fate let's raiseTwo finger shots at this our last soireeFor tomorrow I fearSwoops all too deadly nearThis precipitous weir to Hell's high gateWe touched the starsThat now laugh from afarAt we, the damnedThe damnedThe damnedThe damnedHe was a preditor, creditor, cold.Our blood was shed on the yellowing scroll.And all that glittered, was not gold.But we wanted everything,And for it all, lost our souls.Our soulsFor it all lost our soulsOur souls
