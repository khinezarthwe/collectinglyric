Within the wreckage - Lying behind the rusted doorThe pleasures so cold - The pleasures so coldUnder the leaches - Blood so red, it starts to fallThe method so old - The method so oldWithin the closet - Child in need scratches and brawlsIt's parents are gone - It's parents are goneOutside the wind blows - Cry havoc in the darkend hallsNo one hears their call - No one hears their callFrom nation to nation- The same stories toldCatastropheFrom ages to ages - The cruelty in soulsCatastropheUnder the lampshade - Scratching into her fragile skullThe flesh, it's all gone - The flesh, it's all goneBeneath the brown soil - Murder rots in covered holesThe millions are cold - The millions are coldWithin the damp cell - Man hangs from bloody cordsHe couldn't have more - He couldn't have moreBehind the station - Virus takes it's deadly tollThe needle was old - The needle was oldFrom nation to nation- The same stories toldCatastropheFrom ages to ages - The cruelty in soulsCatastropheDon't cry my childThis is the end
