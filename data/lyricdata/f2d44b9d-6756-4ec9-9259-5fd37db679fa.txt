1st Chorus:Here comes that dog againHe bites me every now and thenFoaming with miseryHe's covered with leather skinBad to bones, lookin' for youRabid to the core, bloody blueI call him Billy BladeHis teeth cut, he's got tattoos yeahDon't call the doctorDon't call the priestI need some rock'n'rollTo live in the streetMama was a shotgunShe was a winner, but never wonWe'll never own a lotTell you somethin', man, ain't go no plot yeah2nd Chorus:That dog, he's in the fogBut in the dark, he's a hungry sharkThat dog, that dog, watch his eyes turn white, get funkyBack home in the woodsRaised by canineNever learned the things i shouldhad to learn to say aliveNow that i live urbanI have a lot more fun hehi might do something wrongBut i know how to run, run away1st Chorus2nd Chorus
