I feel soonI will sinkInto youWhat do you think'Cause there's still bloodIn your hairGot the bruiseOf the yearBut there's something about herLong shady eyesI'm all about herShade tonightI hateYour tattoosYou have weak wristsBut I'll keep you'Cause there's something about herLong shady eyesI'm all about herShade tonightWell, it's too badIt's too badIt's too badYou're marriedTo me
