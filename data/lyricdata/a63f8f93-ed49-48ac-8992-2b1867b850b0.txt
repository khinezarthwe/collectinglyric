Carry this picture for luckKept in a locket, tucked in your collarClose to your chest, make it a secretShown to the closest friendsMeet me at quarter to sevenThe sun will still shine thenAt this time of year, we'll head to the inletAnd we'll share a bottle thereAnd color the coast with your smileIt's the most genuine thingI've ever seen, I was so lostBut now I believeAnd follow me south of the big docksWhere they tether the boatsThe rich men revere, they're so importantThey hire our fathers to steerAnd down to the edge of the waterWhere we'll spill our guts and we'll name our fearsI'll give you this pictureKeep it and don't be scaredAnd color the coast with your smileIts the most genuine thingI've ever seen, I was so lostBut now I believeIn the coastYour smile is the most genuine thingI've ever seen, I was so lostBut now I believe, now I believeNow I believe, now I believe
