You want to see me disappearWell, it starts hereTrying my bestNot to say what you don't want to hearBut it's all right -You can cover your, cover your ears.Face my fearsJust once a yearThe feeling I getWhen I want to return everythingThat's in my lifeI'll be busting at the seams.It's a gamble either wayIf you play your cardsIt's another tidal waveI'll be waiting with my eyes closed.No, I don't want to beThe one who lives a lieBut never knew it.We're just a world away from whereI can feel like I've never felt beforeSo lock the door.You want to see me disappearWell, it starts hereTrying my bestJust to say what you don't want to hearBut it's all right -You can cover your, cover your ears.It's a gamble either wayIf you play your cardsIt's another tidal waveI'll be waiting with my eyes closed.No, I don't want to beThe one who lives a lieBut never knew it.We're just a world away from whereI can feel like I've never felt beforeSo lock the door.You're the one who told meTo pack up all my thingsAnd leave in the morningIt's just a world away from hereAnd I will never bother you no moreAnd that's for sure.No, I don't want to beThe one who lives a lieBut never knew it.We're just a world away from whereI can feel like I've never felt beforeSo lock the door.You're the one who told meTo pack up all my thingsAnd leave in the morningIt's just a world away from hereAnd I will never bother you no moreAnd that's for sure.
