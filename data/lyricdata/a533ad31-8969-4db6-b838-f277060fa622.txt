It's midnight at the Starlite DinerYou said meet me at a quarter to twelveNow I'm standing in the cornerWishing you was here in my armsFare thee well my old friendsFare thee wellIs it possible to love someone too much, you betThe drugs are in the safeAnd the clothes are on the couch, intertwinedBut none of them are yoursAnd all of them are mineSo cry, cry like a babyInto an ocean of wishesBut it don't ever rainOn a street drenched with painted ladiesFare thee well my old friendsFare thee wellHave you ever slept it off to the bonesHaving woken up at night my loveAnd dreamt that you called them allEvery person you could never loveIt's a blow outOn a birthday cakeAnd I'm a birthday candleFloating on the lakeWhere are you it's getting lateIt's midnight at the Starlite DinerYou said meet me 'bout a quarter to twelveAnd I'm standing in the cornerOh there you areThere you areThere you areThere you are
