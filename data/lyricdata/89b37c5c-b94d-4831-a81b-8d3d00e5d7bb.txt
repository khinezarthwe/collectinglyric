You hit me so hard like a Wong Kar Wai beginningI'm exploding in smiles my equilibrium is spinningRapture rapes the musesbut you don't notice that it's kissing youRapture rapes the musesand the void that's left confusesIt's confusingYou keep me lit like antediluvian TroyBut one always reveres what ones bound to destroyGloomy Erebus is an anathema to meAll of them dancing like flames and the sad enmityI wonder if I understand.Am I too young to understand?
