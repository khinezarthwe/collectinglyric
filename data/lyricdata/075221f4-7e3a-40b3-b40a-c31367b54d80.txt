In this camp there's one who delights meBrings afternoon tea then she leaves meWhen they're climbing over the seaShe helps to keep our strength completeBut I'd rather stay'Cause the north is too far awayI wanted to marry BabetteAnd the weapons on my shouldersI'd throw into seaweed banksAnd the willows and the lime treesWere gathered there for usAbove the unconquered seasUnconquered seasThere's the horn callPut your boots and courage on and runI wanted to marry BabetteAnd the weapons on my shouldersI'd throw into seaweed banksAnd the willows and the lime treesWere gathered there for usAbove the unconquered seasUnconquered seasI'm counting up all the lovely yearsSince I had stepped insideWith the others in this lonely fieldWho I fought besideThey mustnâ€™t mindThey must let me go to findA site for my retireWill this warCapture your heart or moreAnd carry you down the shore'Cause the north is too far awayI wanted to marry BabetteAnd the weapons on my shouldersI'd throw into seaweed banksAnd the willows and the lime treesWere gathered there for usAbove the unconquered seasAnd the willows and the lime treesWere gathered there for usAbove the unconquered seas
