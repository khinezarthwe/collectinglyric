Maybe we, why don't weSit right here for half an hour?We'll speak of what a waste I amAnd how we missed your beat againI swear we need to find some comfortIn this run-down placeTo bridge the gap of thisConcious state that we live inAnd I'm short on timeHow come you try to place us allTo fit the shape ofAnd I break what they tell youYou to move onBut mostly what they show you (Move on)At this rate, we can't give upI'm takin' back all the things I've saidI'm takin' back all the things I've saidBut I sure can't just sit stillKeep me filled in and I swear I'll comeWe walk alone, we walk aloneWe walk alone, we walk aloneWe walk alone, we walk aloneBack home aloneBack homeYou're almost gone and I'm okayI still see your shadowTo give you time to be afraidBut never your faceAgain I rememberYour presenceI hope to God you come downI hope to God you feel this nowI hope to God you come downI hope to GodI know there must be some way out of hereAnd all of them will be waiting there
