Let me introduce you since you saw my shadow selfLiving underneath you, she can't resist a tickle outI'm a girl scout searching for the new stuffDid I mention that it melts away (all gone), she puts a sign outOut of order (a want a building that says) makes you strongly disobeyGuiding you away, chiding you awaySo quick to hide when I turn aroundShe will rise just to embarrass meShe likes to dance when it's dark insideJust a flashlight there for a guideTry and catch me if you canFree and wild, watch where you standBelow the net, desire it grows and growsLike a strawberry not a rosePrickly patch don't you stand on meSquishing down in the mud, ahh!
