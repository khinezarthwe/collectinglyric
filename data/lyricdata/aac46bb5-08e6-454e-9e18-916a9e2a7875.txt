Silent talksIn a cold room, lostThoughts are goneI'm aloneWonder whyWhy the faults were mineShould I promise this?Day by dayI need youHold youCan't my eyes just tell?Claim for painWas it all in vain?New sad days to comeMany smiles we've doneMourning faceIn an abandoned fateMy mind is blindBut I still believeThe truth in shadowsLies ad meDon't take my freedomIs all I've gotCan't force my reasonFor lovers knotI'm lonely and lostDon't mistreat meDon't dismiss meIn joy and sorrowFind a meaningKeep on dreamingIt is so hard to learnHere I standIn a castle of sandWho can help me then?
