I know you have a fucked up life,Growing up in a stupid town.Your mother was a mixed-up chick,And your father, he just fucked around.A little too much for his own good.I'd kill the bastard if I could,I'd kill all the boys with their fucked-up noise,And all the bullshit they seem to enjoy.The kids at school called you 'slut', nothing but,And what the fuck are they into, the stupid fools?Losers, assholes, suck all the luck out of the world,The world for you, if I can get it back to you, I will,And kick their asses all over town, all over town.I'll turn it over, and I don't even know you that well.What the hell, summer spell.What's it like going out, and no one knows what you're about,Abused and used and cut in two by hollow man with nothing to do?Laugh all the time, try to get high, and try to hide behind the lie.They fucked your head up, that's for sure.Your heart is ripped, now wrapped in fur,But you know that sex is pretty insane,And magic seems to kill the pain,And the things that go on inside your brain,Makes you seem to think that you're to blame.Don't think about it, throw it out.Love 'em all and say it loud.Fight the scumbags that slap you around.Scream, you're crazy, lost and found.We don't have to tell you what is right.We have all the faith that it was not right.Sadness is and sadness was,And sadness will always be because,Comfort comes around from the strangest of men.I got no time for sad songs, baby.Don't need you to say I'm crazy.Stick your tongue and you look at me,And I will bite it off, you see.Push you down onto your knees,Do you laugh away the fleas?You're not the only one in town,But you're the only one that's got me down.Psychic hearts go out to you.A psychic heart go round to you.My prayer to you is that you do all the things you set out to do,And live your life the way you love.But will you remember one thing for me?I will always love you, I will always love you.
