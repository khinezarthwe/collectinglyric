I dreamed we danced upon the wallAnd on the ceiling, dearWe busted up all of the paintingsAnd broke the chandelierAnd I just want to take you home againSo we can break the nobThat keeps our feet down on the floorboardsNowhere to fallI dreamed your dress was made of mirrorsJust like a disco ballYou shined a millions squares of light, dear???And I just want to take you home againSo we can break the nobThat keeps our feet down on the floorboardsNowhere to fallNowhere to fall
