Today I found a baby's gloveLying on the drainage board, so stillYesterday a leather gloveFrom the slim fingered hand of a womanThe next time I saw oneIt was lying half frozenAnd twisted on the kerbAnd I couldn't take itNow I have my own private collectionAll lined in rows when you open up the wardrobe doorsNow I have no room for my obsessionLined up and labelled in neat little packetsThe next time I saw oneIt stuck inside my headAnd became all thatI could think aboutAnd through wax seals and padlocksA hand through my ribcagePast the choking I saw palms and fingers graspingShoulders...collarbone...crushingI imagined myselfHacking desperately at a sea of appendages,Forward and right,Freeing myself like a butcher,Feeling the mash of bone and sinewRunning slowly down the front of my bodyAnd I couldn't take it any moreI said, I've got to go,I've got to get out of here,I've got to go,And I ran down the street,I've got to go,I've got to get out of here,I've got to go..
