Lord, help me outI'd take my life but i'm in doubtJust where my soul will lieDeep in the earth or way up in the skyLord, can you hear me when I call?Lord, can you hear me when I call?Lord, can you hear me when I call?Lord, can you hear me, hear me at all?All my loves left my sideCan't get enough of life to keep me satisfiedOh I've lost about everythingLord, look what shape I am inLord, can you hear me when I call?Lord, can you hear me when I call?Lord, can you hear me when I call?Lord, can you hear me, hear me at all?
