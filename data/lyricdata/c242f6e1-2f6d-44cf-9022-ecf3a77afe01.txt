So it's time for us to runGrab your things, lock the doors and run.Home is such a dirty wordNo matter what you've heard, it's a lie.Wipe your prints and run.Fame, it means a lot to us.Wash your little hands all by yourself.Dawn it breaks your back so run.Don't look back, no don't look back, just run.Behind every lonely mile,There lies another mile, just for you.You won't be coming home.Fame, it means a lot to us.Wash your little hands all by yourself.If it breaks your heart,It won't take your soulWatch the country fade from the road, you gotta believe.Hold onto something strong that won't move.On your own, you sat in for a bunch who stood free.You'll always, you'll always be free.(Sold my soul for rock and roll and a case of beer.I think I would trade it all for another year.)Hold onHold onHold onJust slow it down.Hold onHold onHold onJust slow it down.I don't believe, I don't believe in anything.I don't believe in anything except you, my friends.
