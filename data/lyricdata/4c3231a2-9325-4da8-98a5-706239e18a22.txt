A thousand violins will play it for youWhile you sit and roll your deep blue eyesA thousand to win, a thousand you loseBut I'll be your consolation prizeAll you do is sighI wore my frings like Roger McGuinn'sI was hoping to impressSo frightfully camp, it made you laughTomorrow I'll buy myself a dressHow ludicrousI don't mean to pry but didn't that guyCrumple up your face a thousand times?He made you cryI'll be your consolation prizeAlthough I knowI'll never be man enough for you
