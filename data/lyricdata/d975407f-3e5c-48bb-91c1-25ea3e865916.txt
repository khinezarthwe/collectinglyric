When you hear twin fiddles and a steel guitarYou're listenin' to the sound of the American heartAnd opry music on a Saturday nightBrings a smile to your face and a tear to your eyeSing a song about the HeartlandThe only place I feel at homeSing about the way a good manWorks until the daylight's goneSing the rain on the roof on a summer nightWhere they still know wrong from rightSing a song about the HeartlandSing a song about my lifeSing a song about the HeartlandThe only place I feel at homeSing about the way a good manWorks until the daylight's goneSing the rain on the roof on a summer nightWhere they still know wrong from rightSing a song about the HeartlandSing a song about my life
