You done it this time like never beforeover my limit can't take it no moreMy blood is boiling can't sleep at nightawake in a cold sweat redy to fightI'm like a time bomb ready to blowchains can't hold me come on lets goyou're the reason I love to hateAnd what you choose will decide your fateI'll bring you down with mecause I hold the keyJailed in your sin 'causeYou're under!! Under my skinReady for battle swinging the chainI'm seeking a vengeance for life and painI'm breathing fire can't hold it backso lock your doors and prepare to attackI'm the fighter the man and the boyand it's my instinct to seek and destroyWhen you hear my battle crydon't you expect to live prepare to dieCHORUSExploding in your ears I release your inner fearsAnd I'm crawling up inside underneath your very hideI got you cornered your back is to the wallMy gun pointed straight at your headpulling the trigger so nice and easyI can't wait to fill you with leadCHORUS
