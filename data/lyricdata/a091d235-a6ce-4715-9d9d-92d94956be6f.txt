When I set foot upon the bus you laughedAnd said, "That's the end for us"Oh, could a joke ever go more wrong?If only you'd have come alongOh but you must stop calling JaneShe is completely without blameDo you have to ring her up so soon?That's rubbing salt into these woundsA little bit of what you fancyDoesn't do you any good at allOh I know that nowI can't add to what I've saidI just completely lost my headDo you want me here when you start to packAnd are you leaving just like that?Have you taken all you want?Is that it? Have you really gone?What can I say to change you mind?There'll never be another timeA little bit of what you fancyDoesn't do you any good at allIt's so clear to me now
