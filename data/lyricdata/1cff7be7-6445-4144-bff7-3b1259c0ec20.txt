Baby don't goTo the haunted hotelGot a really bad feelingIn my lungs and my bonesScience can't save youAnd your parents are awayOn holiday in MexicoBuying trinkets in the townThe haunted hotelIn a dream that I've been havingHas got me waking up sweatingAfraid to turn on the newsMy internal dialogueIs rutted and confusedTrying to find some peace and quietBut the damage was doneAnd my job in the city won't matter no moreWhen the network is down and my flesh is all tornBaby stay hereIn the shadow of the buildingsIn familiar surroundingsIn your safety zoneEvery plane is a missileEvery suitcase a bombThere's no reason in my head nowOnly fear in my bones
