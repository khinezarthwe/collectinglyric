I will never know'Cause you will never showCome on and love me nowCome on and love me nowI will never know'Cause you will never showCome on and love me nowCome on and love me nowCome on and love me nowCarnival came by my town todayBright lights from giant wheelFall on the alleywaysAnd I'm hereBy my doorWaiting for youI will never know'Cause you will never showCome on and love me nowCome on and love me nowI will never know'Cause you will never showCome on and love me nowCome on and love me nowCome on and love me nowI hear sounds of loversBarrel organs, mothersI would like to take youDown thereJust to make you mineIn a merry-go-roundI will never know'Cause you will never showCome on and love me nowCome on and love me now
