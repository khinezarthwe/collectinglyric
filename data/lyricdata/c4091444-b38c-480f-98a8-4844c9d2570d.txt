If i'm not Edward, i'll never be EdwardSo Eddie is just a chance to be fake!So you sit down and order a pint, do you want a friend or do you want a fight?I can see the tears behind your fistYou may think this is just a joke, a little joke to promote my ownBut darling, its the most truth your ears know!So tell me, when the night moves slow, do your green shades growIs it jealousy or an ago?Are you really, really that witty, when you're sitting at home being pretty clipping your nails with my old man?See me, I'm not Edward, I've never been EdwardDarling I'm just a mere mistakeBut I stay free! If i'm not Edward, i'll never be EdwardAnd Eddie is just a chance to be fake!
