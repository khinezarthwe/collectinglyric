Tempered hot, ready or not, you know what I needWhite hot steel, gotta be real, gotta forge to feedLiquid lead my lust unfed, will soon be coldMy love will last within your cast, your body is my moldTake the heat, burnin' treat, push & shove, red hot loveBlueing ore you want more, you just can't stopLike a crane on a chain, I'll take you to the topGot my hand on the firebrand, gonna mark you mineMolten flesh our bodies mesh, oblivious to timeTake the heat, burnin' treat, push & shove, red hot loveHeat sink, I can't think of nobody but youHeat sink, I'm on the brink, love's comin throughCrimson flames lovers' pains, sweat beads down my backClouds of smoke from the coal & coke, feel my heat attackBrittle glass, softening mass, reserves now are spentLike tin weak and thin, frame work now is bentthe fire's down the burnin's stopped, leave me now to coolCold black waste you've had a taste of my heated tool
