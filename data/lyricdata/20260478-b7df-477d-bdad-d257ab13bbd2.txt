Darling, give me your absence tonightTake the shade from the canvas and leave me thewhiteLet me sink in the silence that echoes insideand don't bother leaving the light onCause I suddenly feel like a different personFrom the roots of my soul comes a gentle coercionand I ran my hand o'er a strange inversion --a vacancy that just did not belongThe child is goneHoney, help me out of this messI'm a stranger to myselfBut don't reach for me -- I'm too far awayI don't wanna talk cause there's nothing left to saySo my darling, give me your absence tonightTake all of your sympathy and leave it outsidecause there's no kind of loving that can make thisalrightI'm trying to find a place I belongAnd I suddenly feel like a different personFrom the roots of my soul comes a gentle coercionand I ran my hand o'er a strange inversionas the darkness turns into the dawnThe child is goneThe child is gone
