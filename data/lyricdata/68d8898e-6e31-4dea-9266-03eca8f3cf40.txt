I like to dance all night, summons the dayBut that's how I play, yeah, that's how I playI said, who are you? Don't matter who you areJust so you dance all night and dance all dayI sayI sayWe're gonna build a fire, gonna stoke it upWe're gonna sip this wine and pass the cupWho needs avenues? Who needs reservoirs?We're gonna show this town how to kiss these starsI sayI sayI'm on a hunt to kill, no skin to hideA young mans dream and away I rideAnd every drop that spills on every plot of groundIt's all for you for what you foundI sayI sayI sayI sayIt's gonna take your headAnd gonna drive you homeIt's gonna keep on, keep on, keep onAnd then forever roam
