You dip your hands into my fleshAnd say you won't reveal a scarI must have faith in this procedureIt's a miracle - It's a wonderA thousand hidden needlesIn a thousand covered nervesStick pins in my receptaclesLook to your Voodoo doll - your mojoStaying alive at fiveFor you to cure my ailmentsAnother soul is savedWith your bogus medicationsWhich colour shall we have today?Depends on how I feel you sayConsult your research on the mediaSee blue will calm my hysteriaStaying alive at fiveFor you to cure my ailmentsAnother soul is savedWith your bogus medicationsStaying alive at fiveWith your empty containersAnother corpse ornaments your waiting roomA placebo effect reversedWill you ever regret--the placebo effectCan you ever forget--the placebo effect
