Without you, it's nothingIt's just a room with a viewAnd all these things that we've collectedJust remind me of youAnd everything I doAnd every word I say to youThere's nothing getting throughIs it over?I should know by nowKnow by nowYou let me goYou let me go from youI should know by nowKnow by nowBut somehow I knew I would not get through to youIs there blood in your system?Are there stones in your heart?Alien creationGo and find your starAnd everything I doAnd every time I talk to youNothings getting throughIs it over?I should know by nowKnow by nowYou let me goYou let me go from youI should know by nowKnow by nowBut somehow I knew I would not get through to youI have to sayYou fascinated meBut was it real?Or was it just a dream?I should know by nowKnow by nowYou let me goYou let me go from youI should know by nowKnow by nowBut somehow I knew I would not get through to youI should know by nowKnow by nowYou let me goAnd so we break in two.
