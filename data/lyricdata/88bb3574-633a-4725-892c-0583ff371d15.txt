All my friends have to ask if I'm shattered.I say the past is the past and it no longer matters.I made my mind upI can make itI'll be fineEven if I gotta fake it.I'll keep surviving.Another night - without you.Another night - I know I can get through.Another night - it's only -another night - I won't be lonely.Another night - another night -Another night - it ain't much -Another night - without your touch.I used to search through the crowd to find youBut I don't feel like it nowSo don't look behind you.You better face itI won't be callingI hit my stride when the evening is fallingI'm gonna make it -Another night - without you...Out where the music is loud and the people are laughingI'm gonna step on outI won't be downGonna stand my ground for just another night -Oh yes for a another night.I made my mind upI can make itI'll be fineEven if I gotta fake it.I'll keep survivingYesI will.Another night - without you.Another night - I know I can get through.Another night - it ain't much -I don't need you to be bringing me down
