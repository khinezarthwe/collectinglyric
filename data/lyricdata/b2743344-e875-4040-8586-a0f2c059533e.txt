There's a magical sound slidin' over the groundMakin' it shiver and shakeAnd a permanent cry fallin' out of the skySlippery and sly like a snakeWith a delicate move kind of shifty and smoothA shadow has covered the lightThen a beam in the shade from a silvery bladeIt shattered the edge of the nightI know she waits belowOnly to rise on commandWhen she comes for meShe's got my life in her handsWhen a movement behind hit the side of my mindI trembled and shook it awayThen another assault and I started to falterFibres of steel turned to clayWith a bubbly turn now the water should churnAnd push it way from the coreAnd the lady in white will bring sun to the nightBrighter than ever beforeI know she waits belowOnly to rise on commandWhen she comes for meShe's got my life in her handsLady of the lakeThere's a magical sound sliding over the groundMakin' it shiver and shakeAnd a permanent cry falling out of the skySlippery and sly like a snakeWith a delicate move kind of shifty and smoothA shadow has covered the lightThen a beam in the shade from a silvery bladeHas shattered the edge of the nightStraight down I'm swirling aroundBlinded and bruised by the strainThere must be some way to seeDiamonds out of the rainI know she waits belowOnly to rise on commandWhen she comes for meShe's got my life in her handsLady of the lake
