You still wonder if you understoodThe way I felt about the stoveAt my friend Peter's houseI wish you'd slow it downI thought you'd listen to meI wish you'd try to stop and show meBut you couldn't even slow it down a bitAt least for meYou still wonder if you understoodThe way I felt about the stoveAt our friend Eric's houseI wish you'd leave me beI thought you'd listen to meI wish you'd try to stop and listenThere's other ways I could get itYou know that, don't youYou know that, don't youYou know that, don't youYou know that, don't youSee the colors in your hairTangled knots out in your hairRunning fingers as you swearLooking up with eager stareRed dots in as black comes outWho smells so strong, you talk aboutThe other girls are big or dumbBut colored hair won't make you combI watch you sigh and I watch you shoutWhile you struggle to get your colored mess outAnd won't you help me dry my eyesYou mother tries to comb the knots outYou cry and yell while you cut your knots outI watch you hair fall past your eyesI saw your hair slowly dieI saw your hair slowly dieI saw your hair slowly dieI saw your hair slowly die
