Today was my unlucky day I missed the bus and then the trainAnd my boots filled up with dewToday was my unlucky day I lost my conkers in a gameThen I lost my marbles tooToday was my unlucky dayI broke the swing down by the lakeAnd I fell in twoA hole that someone had dug deep deep deep through the muck and I was fallin'But I'll be comin' home for youMy heart is fonder now you've not been aroundI'll be coming home for youNow that I have learned how a heart can hurtBut no one owns the sea 'cept you and meToday was my unlucky day I sat down underneath the tree, but all the leaves fell offToday was my unlucky day I went down to the library, but all the books were outBeing read by other eyesBeing learned by other spies for their informationPage by page and book by bookThey'll learn how to play hook a dookAnd beat the systemBut I'll be comin' home for youMy heart is fonder now you've not been aroundI'll be coming home for youNow that I have learned how a heart can hurtBut no one owns the sea 'cept you and meToday was my unlucky dayI broke the swing down by the lakeAnd I fell in twoA hole that someone had dug deep deep deep through the mud and I was fallin'Through the centre of the Earth and I'm wonderingHow does this thing gravity work?Because I think I must be halfway thereWill you stop me before Australia ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ohBut I'll be comin' home for youMy heart is fonder now you've not been aroundI'll be coming home for youNow that I have learned how a heart can hurtWell I'll be comin' home for youI heard that you're in bits hope I can fix itI'm coming home to heal your woundsI've got a needle and thread to stitch back up your headBut no one owns the sea 'cept you and me
