Pale September, I wore the time like a dress that yearThe autumn days swung soft around me, like cotton on my skinBut as the embers of the summer lost their breath and disappearedMy heart went cold and only hollow rhythms resounded from withinBut then he rose, brilliant as the moon in fullAnd sank in the burrows of my keepAnd all my armor falling down, in a pile at my feetAnd my winter giving way to warm, as I'm singing him to sleepHe goes along just as a water lilyGentle on the surface of his thoughts his body floatsUnweighted down by passion or intensityYet unaware of the depth upon which he coastsAnd he finds a home in meFor what misfortune sows, he knows my touch will reapAnd all my armor failing down, in a pile at my feetAnd my winter giving way to warm, as I'm singing him to sleepAll my armor falling down, in a pile at my feetAnd my winter giving way to warm, as I'm singing him to sleep
