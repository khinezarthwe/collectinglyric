Interlocked insatiableUnraveled and untwinedAll that is left is whatI wish I'd left behindWith ignorance ignoredI threw it all awayIf only you believedThere's more than just todayI'm longing for those never metFallen to a fear far crueler than regretThrough thick layersYou will find a wayAnd punish me forThe things i didn't sayA slow beginning endingStart with honest intensionsMuch colder todayFind comfort in suspensionTo think that I believedWhen you walked without convictionI'm longing for those never metFallen to a fear far crueler than regretPierce through stolen velvetSpare me the last ounce of viciousnessAll I have are reasonsTo hold to the purity in thisI'm longing for those never metFallen to a fear far crueler than regret
