There's a purple heart on the stars and stripes tonightIt's pinned to the chest of the latest liarAnd if you try to speak your mindThey tell you keep it to yourselfYou got friends in the armed forcesThey wanna know which side you're onDoesn't matter cause we'll all be offTo train, to fightDisregard our human rightsTo play the partThe conscience of the damnedYou say you're defending meI'm sick of tying yellow ribbonsPraying not to seeAnother folded flag to a mourning motherHe was an army of one but they'll find anotherAnd in the fold of the body bagSomebody check for a heartYou got friends in the armed forcesNow we know what a soldier costsIt's the cost of the rest of usTo take a lifeWe all have our priceThe wife and kids sleep soundly in their bedsYou say you're defending meI'm untying yellow ribbonsOn every single tree I seeThey'll float like butterflies back homeAnd I can feel the desert's heatWhen you're standing next to meFriendship offers no reliefStay with me now, just hear me outDon't want to lose you to that great black cloudComing downYou see in the path a bullet makesWhen it calls you by your nameAnd the medic can't play the rhythm of your heartSo it starts to fade like footsteps in the marchThe parade passes by our fingertipsAs lives once were rightTo change our mindsEverything that's wrong looks rightThe lives we leadAre somewhere in betweenYou say you're defending meI'm sick of tying yellow ribbonsPraying not to seeWe're not going to hellTo run rings around a wishing well
