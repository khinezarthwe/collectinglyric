Brickwalker won't you cease your timeInstead of ruin daily livesAgainst the grain they standAgainst the grain they fallPaint them a picture of their fateFace their fearless looks so paleIt's so goddamn beautiful...You've already put your hands on their fateYour mind is clear and your speech is freeYour doors are shut and they won't seeWith your cynic presence they'll shiver'til the break of dawnCome on, come on, come onThey're so expendableWe're all so fatal, we're all too ableWe'd like to have a break... SAYWe're all so tragic, illogical magicWe'd like to turn the page... SAYSo, watch them cross the yard of timeDo not fail don't cross that lineInside, they will leave tonightVanish through the skyDon't throw the page. Don't throw it all away!Gotta turn the page. Just lead thy pain astray!
