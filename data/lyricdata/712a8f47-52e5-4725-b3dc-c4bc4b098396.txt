"dnatsrednu t'nod uoy sgni't htiw elddem t'nodecnuob eert htiw gni't eht dias oh tahw mmmh mmmh"Take a look in the pool and what do you seeIn the dark depths, their faces beckoning meCan't you see them? It's plain for all to seeThey were there, oh I know you don't believe meOh, I've never felt so strangeBut I'm not going insaneI've no doubt that you think I'm off my headYou don't say but it's in your eyes insteadHours I spend out just gazing into that poolSomething draws me there, I don't know what to doOh, they drain my strength awayOh, they're asking me to stayNightmaresSpirits calling meNightmaresThey won't leave me beAll my life's blood is slowly draining awayAnd I feel that I'm weaker every daySomehow I know I haven't long to goJoining them at the bottom of the poolNow I feel they are so nearI begin to see them clearNightmaresComing all the timeNightmaresWill give me peace of mindNow it's clear and I know what I have to doI must take you down there to look at them tooHand in hand then we'll jump right into the poolCan't you see not just me, they want you tooOh, we'll drown togetherIt will be foreverNightmaresForever calling meNightmaresNow we rest in peace
