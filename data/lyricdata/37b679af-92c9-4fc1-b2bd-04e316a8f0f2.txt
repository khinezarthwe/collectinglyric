So after all, you needed more than a death threat fallYou needed more, and I let you fallInto the coffin with your floor-dropped jawAnd I remember you aspiration, your dream to fit inBut it's gone, and they're hereSo let's kill these felons nowBut I remember you, you'll go, you'll find a way back homeBut I remember you, when you stand thereYou stand with your eyes closedAnd I feel, tonight, that I let you dieBut you could have lived forever, it took smiles to keep you aliveBut heroes die, and so did mineBut you go, and I stay, will it keep you at peace nowBut I remember you, you'll go, you'll find a way back homeBut I remember you, when you stand thereYou stand with your eyes closedYou stand with your eyes closedYou stand with your eyes closedYou stand with your eyes closedI'll dig you out, and I'll sit you upFor the fools to find you, the fools breathe into youI'll dig you out, and I'll sit you upFor the fools to find you, the fools breathe into youBreathe into youSo sleep child no one can touch you nowNo one can hurt you now, not here anymore
