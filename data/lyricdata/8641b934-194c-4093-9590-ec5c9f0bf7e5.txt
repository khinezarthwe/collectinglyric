You walk through the subway,His eyes burn a hole in your back.A footstep behind you,He lunges prepared for attack.Scream for mercy,He laughs as he's watching you bleed.Killer behind you,His blood lust defies all his needs.My innocent victimsAre slaughtered with wrath and despise,The mocking religion of hatredThat burns in the night.I have no-one,Am bound to destroyAll this greed.A voice inside me,Compelling to satisfy me.I can see,What a life's meant to be.You'll never know,How I came to foresee.My faith in believing is strongerThan lifelines and ties,With the glimmer of metalMy moment is ready to strike.The death call arises,A scream breaks the still of the night.Another tomorrowRemember to walk in the light.I have found you,And now there is no place to run.Excitement shakes me,Oh God help me what have I done.Yeah I've done it again!He walks through the subwayMy eyes burn a hole through your back.A footstep behind youHe lunges prepared for attack.Scream for mercy,He laughs as he's watching you bleed.Killer behind you,My blood lust defies all my needs.Look out I'm coming for you!
