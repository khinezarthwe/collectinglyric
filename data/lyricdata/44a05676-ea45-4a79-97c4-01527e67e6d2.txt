I don't get you, I can't forget what you've forgotten.All along I've never been so alone.Don't cry out, cease fire.I was pretending your secret kiss of confidenceWas my escape, the perfect game to play.Don't cry out, cease fire.Ten, nine, eight, and I'm breaking away.I'm all dressed up and I'm ready to play.Seven, six, five, four, and I'm all over you.Counting three, two, one, and I'm having fun...Your fascination with naked walls of silk and skinWith no conditions, I needed you to notice.That's all I wanted!Don't cry out, cease fire.Ten, nine, eight, and I'm breaking away.I'm all dressed up and I'm ready to play.Seven, six, five, four, and I'm all over you.Counting three, two, one, and I'm having fun...Ten, nine, eight, and I'm breaking away.I'm all dressed up and I'm ready to play.Seven, six, five, four, and I'm all over you.Counting three, two, one, and I'm having fun...Don't cry out, cease fire.Ahhhhhhhhhhh!Ten, nine, eight, and I'm breaking away.
