I've got a gun in my hand and I feel like a manI'm the pope of my generationI've gotta push myself over your goddamn wallsI don't listen to your condemnationCan't you see the pain that you bringIs only the cause of everythingThat you wish to stop and bring to an endBut it only makes me hate you moreCareful what you wish forIt can only bring you downKeep your spirit on the groundEmptiness the only soundI know what it takes to break youAnd I'll kill everything that made you(I know what it takes to break you down)Take everything that you tried to teach meIt don't add up to a pile of shitAll the methods you used as you tried to reach meThey don't matter not a single bitI'm alright inside, I'm just trying to hideFrom all the propaganda you want to choked me withKeep your face away, keep your hands awayDon't want your fingers in and out of my lifeI know what it takes to break you(I know what it takes to break you down)And I'll kill everything that made you(I know what it takes to break you down)I know what it takes to break youAnd I'll kill everything that made youI know what it takes to break you(I know what it takes to break you down)And I'll kill everything that made you(I know what it takes to break you down)
