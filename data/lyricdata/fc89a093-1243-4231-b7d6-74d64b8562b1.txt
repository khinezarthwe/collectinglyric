Saw you standing on the street cornerWell you were waiting -And that you can't denyYou say your last john was peculiarHe moved in a mysterious wayBut a kiss on the lipsIs far too much for anyoneSo kneel and pray and pray some moreYou're the whore of godIn the sky there are so many starsAnd you can count themWhen you're getting boredSold your soul and it was gloriousBut now you're frightened'cause he wants still moreBut a kiss on the lipsIs far too much for anyoneSo kneel and pray and pray some moreYou're the whore of godThe whore of godYou're the whore of god
