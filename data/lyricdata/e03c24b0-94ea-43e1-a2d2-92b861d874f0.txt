Watchin’ a stretch of road, miles of light explodeDriftin’ off a thing I’d never done beforeWatchin’ a crowd roll inOut go the lights, it beginsA feelin’ in my bones, I never felt before(Mmmmmm)People always told meThat bars are dark and lonelyAnd talk is often cheap and filled with airSure, sometimes they thrill meBut nothing could ever chill meLike the way they make the time just disappearFeelin’ you’re here againHot on my skin againFeelin’ good a thing, I’d never known beforeWhat does it mean to feel?Millions of dreams come realA feelin’ in my soul, I’d never felt before(Mmmmm…)And you always told meNo matter how long it holds meIf it falls apartOr makes us millionairesYou’ll be right here foreverGo through this thing togetherAnd on heaven’s golden shore we’ll lay our heads
