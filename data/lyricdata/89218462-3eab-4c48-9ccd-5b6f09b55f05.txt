Everything's alrightIt takes a strength beyond strength to smileI'm missing you like hurricanesI give them names but their waves keep rollingOn and on and on and onMy sails are tatteredThey're worn bone thinI will be the kingAll I need is the comfort of a stageSmile and take a dragLaugh and say we're only having funI watch the winter passFrom under the umbrella you leftThe winds are dying a slow deathCut my heart out but it's still beatingOn and on and on and onMy sails are tatteredThey're worn bone thinYou will be the queenYou will be guilded by the swordMy prints are uniqueYou've been touched time and time again
