How can I say it? Where do I begin,Everything you are is just what it says on the tinWords that were honest, spoken from the heart,Everything you did was just what you said from the start.You are the angel with whom I would gladly live in sin,Thanks for being exactly what it says on the tin.I never doubted, and though I never shouted from the roof,All about it, I'm with you every day as living proof.Ain't gonna lose now, such a lot to win,'Cos I will always know you're just what it says on the tin.You are the angel with whom I would gladly live in sin,Thanks for being exactly what it says on the tin.I never doubted, and though I never shouted from the roof,All about it, I'm with you every day as living proof.Ain't gonna lose now, such a lot to win,'Cos I will always know you're just what it says on the tin.You're just what it says on the tin.Just what it says on the tin
