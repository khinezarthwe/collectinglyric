Half smoked cigarettes and you're the trash that infests my sheetscan't make a wife out of a whore, don't want your skin on meAnd you're, and you're addicted to the drug of lustA detox in the cold sweat of shameand i love your painI gave you these roses now but i left in the thornsI'd rather hurt someone than hurt myselfI'll dispose of you like a lighter out of fuelI'll lose you somewhere on a dusty shelfSo this love's been worn down, like songs on a tapeThe sex has lost all of its fun, like gum loses tasteAnd you're, you're addicted to the drug of lust,A detox in the cold sweat of shameand i love your painI gave you these roses now but i left in the thornsI'd rather hurt someone than hurt myselfI'll dispose of you like a lighter out of fuelI'll lose you somewhere on the shelfI'm here lying in your bed babeRemember what you said to me"You can be my James dean, I'll be your sweet queen"I said that you were my first, but you weren't even close nowLike a frame in a movie, you're just one of manyCan you grant me one last wishPlay Russian roulette as we kissI'll be your cheap noveltyBlow your brains out on meI gave you these roses now but i left in the thornsI'd rather hurt someone than hurt myselfI'll dispose of you like a lighter out of fuelI'll lose you somewhere on the shelf
