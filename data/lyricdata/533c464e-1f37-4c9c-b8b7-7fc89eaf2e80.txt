Well, I don't know why I came here tonightI got the feeling something ain't rightI'm so scared in case I fall off my chairAnd I'm wondering if I'll get down the stairsClowns to the left of me, jokers to the rightHere I am, stuck in the metal with youStuck in the metal with youYes, I'm stuck in the metal with youAnd I'm wondering what is I could doIt's so hard to keep this smile from my faceLose control and I'm all over the placeClowns to the left of me, jokers to the rightHere I am, stuck in the metal with you[Chorus:]Well, you started out with nothingAnd you're proud you're a self-made manAnd your friends they all come crawlingSlap you on the back and say, "Please, please"And I tried to make some sense of it allBut I can see that it makes no sense at allIs it blue to go to sleep on the floor?'Cause I don't think that I can take anymoreClowns to the left of me, jokers to the rightHere I am, stuck in the metal with you[Repeat Chorus]Well, I don't know why I came here tonightI got the feeling something ain't rightI'm so scared in case I fall off my chairAnd I'm wondering if I'll get down the stairsClowns to the left of me, jokers to the rightHere I am, stuck in the metal with youYes, I'm stuck in the metal with youHere I am, here I amStuck in the metal with you
