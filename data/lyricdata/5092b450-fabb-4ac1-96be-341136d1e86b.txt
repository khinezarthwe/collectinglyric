Butcher the paper with a ravenous pen,Carving out trees and scoring skinAnimals too placed in plastic cages,Carted around these filthy pagesI will draw Japan, I will draw Japan, heySpectres holding sceptres with fingers thin,Empty vessels asserting, we are still King,We are still KingBlack stuff running like nosebleed dangerSwarming towards the source of the noiseI will draw Japan, with fervent hands, heyBlack cells depict a foreign land, I draw JapanSleeping city emits no sound, in this compoundNo beast awalks in this compoundNo beast awalks in this compoundI will draw Japan with a ravenous pen,Hungry for oil and iron and tinTo your left a concrete factory,Smoke billows, fists punch, Victory!And my hands start shaking, and Japan starts shaking, Hey!And I begin to draw out Japan in the shape of a manSeen rushing through a market town, through the compoundNo beast awalks in this compoundNo beast awalks in this compoundNo beast awalks in this compoundNo beast awalks in this compound
