Charlie once sat on the sidewalk babyHe asked her about my nameAnd at that noise you came and met meYou said that I was to blameSugarcane eyes with no decisionIt's your trial and tribulationIsn't It time you made up your mindAnd gave me a ticket to ride(I won't get you down until)These light are tripping us outWe are so out of controlWon't you come on a rideThis time we'll do it for kicksWe can fall awayWith the cat and the eyePretty face paper people babyThey all look the same to meRunning on angels ain't that easyThese things you've gotta believeEverything's kind of different for meThe songs still mean the sameIsn't it time to reinvent me soLest take a piece of the pie(I won't get you down until)These light are tripping us outWe are so out of controlWon't you come on a rideThis time we'll do it for kicksWe can fall awayWith the cat and the eyeThese light are tripping us outWe are so out of controlWon't you come on a rideThis time we'll do it for kicksWe can fall awayWith the cat and the eyeHere we areChasing on a sun beamHere we areChasing on a sun beam(Pacing on to sorry)(Pacing on to sorry)These light are tripping us outWe are so out of controlWon't you come on a rideThis time we'll do it for kicksWe can fall awayWith the cat and the eye
