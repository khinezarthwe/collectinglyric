These four walls have seen the worst of me.The bleeding confession, but they'll never speak.These four walls have seen the life I truly lead.The crying depression. They weak in the knees.Right on the floor.Please walls, stay quietReputation is on the line.Please God, stay quiet.Don't let them know you're watching me die.Falling down.The waves are crashing in on me again.Falling down.The walls are closing in on me again.Falling down.The waves are crashing in on me again.Falling down.I feel the weight, I feel the weight again.And If you open up your heart you'll seeI'm only human. Let me be me.And if you could open up your heart you'll seeThis wasn't my intent. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.Right on the floor.Please walls, stay quietReputation is on the line.Please God, stay quiet.Don't let them know you're watching me die.Falling down.The waves are crashing over me again.Falling down.The walls are closing in on me again.Falling down.The waves are crashing in on me again.Falling down.I feel the weight, I feel the weight again.Right on the floor.
