Enter her lairDeep in her lairThe tension you feelIs burning insideYou meet her at lastIt happened so fastThe look in her eyesThere's nowhere to hidePain on her mindEternal and blindEverything's blackBut you're turning whiteShe knocks you downWhips you aroundNothing is heardBut your screams in the nightMistress of painLady of dominationExecutes her disciplineUpon her bonded slavesLashing you with her whipsKeeping you bonded in chainsDrool starts to seep through her lipsGets off on affliction of painViolence in her eyesInsatiable lustTerminal mistakeFace to face with death
