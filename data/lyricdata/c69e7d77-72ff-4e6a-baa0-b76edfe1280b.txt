Every morning when I wake up yawningI'm still far awayTrucks still rolling through the early morningTo the place we playBoy you're home, you're dreaming, don't you knowThe tour's still far awayBoy you're home, you're dreaming, don't you knowYou're having just a breakDream we're going out on stage, it feels likeComing home againDream we're going out on stage, it feels likeComing home againDream we're going out on stage, it feels likeYear after year out on the roadIt's great to be here to see you allI know, for me it is likeComing homeDay after day out on the roadThere's no place too far we wouldn't goWe go wherever you likeTo rock 'n rollJump on the seats, put your hands in the airGive me a shout, let me hear you out thereThe wilder you scream for some more rock 'n rollThe higher we goYear after year out on the roadIt's great to be here to rock you allI know, for me it is likeComing homeComing homeI know, for me it is likeComing homeComing homeLike coming homeComing homeLike coming homeComing homeLike coming homeComing homeLike coming homeComing home
