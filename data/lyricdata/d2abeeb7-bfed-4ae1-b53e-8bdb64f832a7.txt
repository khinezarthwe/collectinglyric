We were both young when I first saw youI close my eyes and the flashback startsI'm standing thereOn the balcony in summer airSee the lights, see the party, the ball gownsSee you make your way through the crowdAnd say, "Hello."Little did I knowThat you were Romeo, you were throwing pebblesAnd my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet!"And I was crying on the staircaseBegging you, "Please don't go!"And I saidRomeo, take me somewhere we can be aloneI'll be waiting, all there's left to do is runYou'll be the prince and I'll be the princessIt's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes."So I sneak out to the garden to see youWe keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knewSo close your eyesEscape this town for a little whileOh, oh'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letterAnd my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet!"But you were everything to meI was begging you, "Please don't go!"And I saidRomeo, take me somewhere we can be aloneI'll be waiting, all there's left to do is runYou'll be the prince and I'll be the princessIt's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes."Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feelThis love is difficult, but it's realDon't be afraid, we'll make it out of this messIt's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes."Oh, ohI got tired of waitingWondering if you were ever coming aroundMy faith in you was fadingWhen I met you on the outskirts of townAnd I saidRomeo, save me, I've been feeling so aloneI keep waiting for you but you never comeIs this in my head, I don't know what to thinkHe knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and saidMarry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be aloneI love you, and that's all I really knowI talked to your dad, go pick out a white dressIt's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes."Oh, ohOh, oh, oh'Cause we were both young when I first saw you
