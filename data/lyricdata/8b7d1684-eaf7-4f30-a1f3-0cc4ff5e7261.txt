JEANEThe low-life has lost its appealAnd I'm tired of walking these streetsTo a room with its cupboard bareJEANEI'm not sure what happiness meansBut I look in your eyesAnd I know that it isn't thereWe tried, we failedWe tried and we failedWe tried and we failedWe tried and we failedWe triedJEANEThere's ice on the sink where we batheSo how can you call this a homeWhen you know it's a graveBut you still hope for ridding graceAs you tidy the placeBut it will never be clean, JEANEWe tried, we failedWe tried and we failedWe tried and we failedWe tried and we failedWe triedCash on the nailIt's just a fairy taleAnd I don't believe in magic anymore, JEANEBut I think you knowI really think you knowI think you know the truthJEANENo heavenly choirNot for me and not for youBecause I think that you knowI really think you knowI think you know the truthJEANEThat we tried and we failedThat we tried and we failedWe tried and we failedWe tried and we failedOh JEANE
