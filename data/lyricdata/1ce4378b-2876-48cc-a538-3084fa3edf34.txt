Lyrics to 'Julian' by Mongrel from the album 'Better Tan Heavy'(John McClure)Julian, were the baddy handled maybe by the gun,you'll get your just dessertsbecause you know for what it's worththere's no escaping from the web of lies you've spunBecause the pessimist is seldom disappointedI know they'll tap the claret when they catch youGot a date with death so don't miss your appointmentJulian, they're coming after youJulian, you and the truth you don't quite get a longMr Vengeance and his crewreckon that they're looking for youNow everyone's a sprinter once the race has runBecause the pessimist is seldom disappointedI know they'll tap the claret when they catch youconfess your sins and chat to the annointedJulian, they're coming after youAnd there ain't no patch for this rift that jewels causedGangsters sharpening their knivesI know they'll blast him to the everlastingThose gangsters sharpening their knives(Lowkey)Honestly he got on the beat to stop the monotonyOld toppers, top shottas, bosses, a lot of G'sOften got wobbly knees when he crossed the streetThe problem was P's (pounds) unless he won the lotteryHis life was like lyrics written to the wrong beatThe face he knew before became a zombieStill, he was headed for darker thingsVarious Bredders from different area were after himHe left the country, when he cam back he had a tanLanded back in the manor with the orangutansJust so happens, he ran into a bag of badder manBLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! They let the hammer bangChasing beef's a dead end, why cant guys see?I wish Julian luck, most aren't like meBut the truth is the truth and I can lie GThe guy I knew his story ended R.I.P.('John McClure)Because the pessimist is seldom disappointedI know they'll tap the claret when they catch youGot a date with death so don't miss your appointmentCos, Julian, they're coming after youJulian, they're coming after youJulian, they're coming after you
