Nothing was supposed to hurt like thisMissing you was always one more kissNow there's nothing that I can doOne more nail in the coffin, and it's all for youAlways were and always were a simple love storyYou were everything I ever hoped and dreamedDrown me in a pool of my bloodIt's getting harder just to breatheI'll suffocate you faster just so you can't see, so you can't see me sleepIt's getting harder just to say the right thingsI've seen the angel's face, and I've heard her sing to meFrom my reflection on this razor bladeI've heard ten thousand dying screams, and they're calling meThe day will break on this saddest daySo don't let me wakeI've heard this all beforeI've seen this over and over againDon't let me wakeDrown me in a pool of my bloodIt's getting harder just to breatheI'll suffocate you faster just so you can't see, so you can't see me sleepSo you can't see me sleepOhSo you can see me sleep (sleep)So you can see me sleep (sleep)The day will break on this saddest daySo don't let me wakeI've heard this all beforeI've seen this over and over againDon't let me wakeNothing was supposed to hurt like thisAnd missing you was always one more kissAnd now there's nothing that I can doThere's just one more nail in the coffinThere's just one more nail, and it's all for youI've seen the angel's face, and I've heard her sing to meFrom my reflection on this razor bladeI've heard ten thousand dying screams, and they're calling meThe day will break on this saddest daySo don't let me wakeI've heard this all beforeI've seen this over and over againDon't let me wake
