My conviction is stronger todayAs I fight to uncover your sacred lieAnd the fear isn't going awayAs the soldiers still dieLet your followers knowThat their lives have been soldFor the good of your sacred lieFor the truth to be toldAnd the plan to unfoldWe must start asking whyDon't you know the war is far from over now?What a stumbling block we've fallen over nowAs our brothers die defending no oneThe war is far from over nowLiberation, a moral charadeFor the cause is a part of your sacred lieDamnation a moment awayIn all the world's eyesIt's the doom of us allWe give in to controlFor the sake of your sacred lieComplications aboundYou'll get used to the soundOf alarms in your lifeDon't you know the war is far from over now?What a stumbling block we've fallen over nowAs our brothers die defending no oneThe war is far from over nowGive us a moment of peace in our lifetimeA moment of peace in our lifetimeA moment of peace right now
