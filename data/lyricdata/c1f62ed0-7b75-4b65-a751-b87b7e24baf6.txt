I want a book that'll make me drunkFull of freaks and disenfranchised punksNo amount of hate, no load of junkNo bag of words, no costume trunkCould make me feel the same wayAn inch an hour, two feet a dayTo move through night in this most fashionable wayThere's this fucking band you got to seeThey used to scare the living shit out of meNo frothing dog, no cool insanityNo rock and roll, no christianityMakes me feel the same wayAn inch an hour, two feet a dayTo move through night with very little else to sayBut I'm helpless less with the people than the spaceNo struggle town, no bemused TrudeauNo solitary walks through vacant lots in moon glowTonight the winter may have missed its markYou can see your breath in springside parkCoffee coloured ice and peeling birch barkThe sound of rushing water in the darkMakes me feel the same wayAn inch an hour, two feet a dayTo move through life with very little else to sayBut I'm helpless more with the people than the spaceI mean I'm helpless less with the people than the spaceYou see, I don't know Neil, I don't know Neil
