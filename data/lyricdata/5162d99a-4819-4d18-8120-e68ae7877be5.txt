Looking at all the rowsAll these records look like big zeroesGot your picture on the back of a 45A placeholder until you take up mineA placeholder until you take up mineI'm the person you'll never needThe biggest loser on 16th StreetThe invisible man with the see-through mindA placeholder until you take up mineA placeholder until you take up mineBreak off of in someone's laughterYou can tell right thereHe's still a squareHe likes the way that you look nowLike an open bookJust like my favorite songSome pretty words that didn't last that longLike a package sent priority overnightPlaceholder, come and take up minePlaceholder, come and take up minePlaceholder, come and take up minePlaceholder, come and take up mine
