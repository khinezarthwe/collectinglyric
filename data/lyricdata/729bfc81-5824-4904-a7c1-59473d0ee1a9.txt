Bored of the life in the city of goldHe'd left and let nobody know.Gone were the towers he had known from a child,Alone with the dream of a lifeHe travelled the wide open road,The blinkered arcade,In search of another to share in his life.Nowhere.Everyone looked so strange to him.They've got no horns and they've got no tailThey don't even know of our existence.Am I wrong to believe in a city of goldThat lies in the deep distance, he criedAnd wept as they led him away to a cageBeast that can talk, read the sign.The creatures they pushed and they prodded his frameAnd questioned his story again.But soon they grew bored of their preyThe beast that can talk?More like a freak or publicity stunt.OhNo.They've got no horns and they've got no tailThey don't even know of our existence.Am I wrong to believe in a city of goldThat lies in the deep distance, he criedAnd broke down the door of the cage and marched on out.He grabbed a creature by the scruff of his neck, pointing out:There, beyond the bounds of your weak imaginationLie the noble towers of my city, bright and gold.Let me take you there, show you a living storyLet me show you others such as meWhy did I ever leave?They've got no horns and they've got no tailThey don't even know of our existenceAm I wrong to believe in a city of goldThat lies in the deep distance, he criedAnd wept.And so we set out with the beast and his hornsAnd his crazy description of home.After many days journey we came to a peakWhere the beast gazed abroad and cried out.We followed his gaze and we thought that maybe we sawA spire of gold - no, a trick of the eye that's all,But the beast was gone and a voice was heard:They've got no horns and they've got no tailThey don't even know of our existenceAm I wrong to believe in a city of goldThat lies in the deep distanceHello friend, welcome home.
