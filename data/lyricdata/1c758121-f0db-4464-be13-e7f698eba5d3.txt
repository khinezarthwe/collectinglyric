I want you to want him.As we move on and we look backWe both knew the truth, we were as wrong as wrong could beEven at our worst, somehow we made it workThose days are gone, since been cheated by three dull wordsDown the road,Looming roadI won't wait for youI won't wait for you.Right now I hate myself.I don't want you to want him.Somehow I changed myselfI don't want you to want himI don't want you, noI don't want you., I don't.Right now, I hate myself.I don't want you to want him, NoI don't want you to want him, but I don't want you.
