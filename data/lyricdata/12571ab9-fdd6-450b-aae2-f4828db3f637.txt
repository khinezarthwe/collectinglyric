Prey LyricsCradle Of FilthNightfall, in thrallI call her beauty to meWhose ebon-lidded eyes exciteShadows to wander through meWhose kiss glittered with sleepIs a thief come after darkTo steal away the leaden wreathsFrom my cemetery heartThrilled to see the lightBruise-reddened, silhouettingMurder sitesAs dusk attends her son's blood weddingSpilt across the skiesIn reefs of omenLicking flames and pagan ritesThe night awaits with baited thighsStart this artist darknessYearning now to start thisBurning as an artistTurning on the darknessDizzy looking up with pervertigoA sewer deity of recrementWorld belowI'll make you prayI spy with wicked lipsThe cream of mortal kindCommitting their sinsTheir penitent skinsTo the harems of my mindPreyThrilled to breathe tonightThe sultry air of gracesPassed in flightLike birds of May with playful facesFills me with delightTheir crystal skirtsSpun from stars, worn tightWink of fists in wishful placesStart this artist darknessYearning now to start thisBurning as an artistTurning on the darknessDizzy looking up with pervertigoA sewer deity of recrementWorld belowI'll make you prayMy whims like smoke in summertimeWrithe atop the bloomsCommitting their thinWhite Catholic limbsTo the cloister in my roomYou see I needTo feed my dreams to orderTo be agreedWith the beast in meThat bleeds their bordersPreyNightfall, in thrallI call her beauty to meWhose ebon-lidded eyes exciteShadows to wander through meWhose kiss glittered with sleepIs a thief come after darkTo steal away the leaden wreathsFrom my cemetery heart
