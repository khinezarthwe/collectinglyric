Mother don't worry, I killed the last snake that lived in the creek bedMother don't worry, I've got some money I saved for the weekendMother remember being so stern with that girl who was with me?Mother remember the blink of an eye when I breathed through your body?So may the sunrise bring hope where it once was forgottenSons are like birds, flying upward over the mountainMother I made it up from the bruise on the floor of this prisonMother I lost it, all of the fear of the Lord I was givenMother forget me now that the creek drank the cradle you sang toMother forgive me, I sold your car for the shoes that I gave youSo may the sunrise bring hope where it once was forgottenSons could be birds, taken broken up to the mountainMother don't worry, I've got a coat and some friends on the cornerMother don't worry, she's got a garden we're planting togetherMother remember the night that the dog had her pups in the pantry?Blood on the floor,  fleas on their paws, and you cried till the morningSo may the sunrise bring hope where it once was forgottenSons are like birds, flying always over the mountain
