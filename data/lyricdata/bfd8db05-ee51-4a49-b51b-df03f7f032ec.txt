Marching alone, like a good soldier doesI'm setting sail with anchors holding me downPack up my bags, stow them away (stow them away)Bidding farewell to all that is safeWill I come up for air, come up for air?After a while the current is calling me, lulling meWaving goodbye, I'm out here aloneOh God can you save me now?Sinking, my heart turns to stoneWithering away, a shrinking violet diesSo full of life, these lights have dried me outInto the sea, I needed a drinkI never thought this would consume me wholeWill I come up for air, come up for air?After a while the current is calling me, lulling meWaving goodbye, I'm out here aloneOh God can you save me now? (save me now)Sinking, my heart turns to stone (I turn to stone, turns to stone)Sinking my heart turns to stoneSave me, take me homeOver and over againSave me, take me homeWishing that this all would endSave me, take me homeOver and over againSave me, take me homeWishing that this all would endAfter a while the current is calling me, lulling meWaving goodbye, I'm out here aloneOh God can you save me now?After a while the current is calling me, lulling meWaving goodbye, I'm out here aloneOh God can you save me now?Sinking, my heart turns to stone (I turn to stone, turns to stone)Sinking my heart turns to stoneSave me, take me homeWhen I come up for air, when I come up for airSave me, take me homeWhen I come up for air, when I come up for airSave me, take me homeOver and over againSave me take me homeWishing that thisWishing that all this would end
