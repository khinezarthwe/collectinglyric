Seen your footsteps on my trailIf you're not lost, we'll never failto wind up back in thereSee coal shatter I can't say hereI've worn a shackle now for a yearNow I leave it for anotherNo more labor in pouring rainthe loving maker is the only thing i speak ofIn the godly hourAnd the man who learned me made me swearhe took my blood out and didn't careOh, yes sirYou know what's bestJust got out, man, paid my fineAnd no good reason to call my timeOh, wait, I took a lifeAnd the jail I speak of is no placeIt's in my mind, man, behind my facethis freedom is in my heartThis freedom is in my heartThis freedom is in my heart
