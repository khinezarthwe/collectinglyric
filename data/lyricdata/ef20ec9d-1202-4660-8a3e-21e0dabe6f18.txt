Hello, it's me, it's me calling outI can see youHello, it's me, crying out, crying outAre you there?Hello, it's me, it's meI wanna touch youIt's me, throwing stones from the starsOn your mixed up worldBeen circling round for 20 yearsAnd in that time I've seen all the fires and all the liarsI've been calling home for 20 yearsAnd in that time I heard the screams rebound to me while you were making historyI could see the fireAnd I'll throw the fire back down
