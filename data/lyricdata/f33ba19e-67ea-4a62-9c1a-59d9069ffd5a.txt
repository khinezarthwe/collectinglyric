I can never forget youThe way you rock the girlsThey rule the world and love youA blast in the underworldI stick a knife in my headThinkin' about your eyesBut now that you've been shot deadI've got a new surpriseI've been waiting for you just to sayThat Zoftig chick is mineBut all I know is you got no moneyBut that's got nothing to do with a good timeCan you forgive the boy who shot you in the head?Or should you get a gun and go and get revenge?100% of my love up to you, true starIt's hard to believe you took offI always thought you'd go farI've been around the world a million timesAnd all you men are slimeA gun to my head, goodbye, I am deadWastewood rockers, it's time for crime, hey!
