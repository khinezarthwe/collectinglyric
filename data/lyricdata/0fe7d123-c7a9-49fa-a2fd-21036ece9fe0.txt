So much for youI can't take this lifeTo be with youOnly pushes me, deeper downGuilt pain and sorrowAre what haunt me stillWaking tomorrow Will I feel the same?Memories breaking meKill what I used to beWandering on I know miseryAlone in silenceAll I had before, gone from meLook to the past For any comfortingHappiness lastsOnly when your deadMemories breaking meKill what I used to beCan I feel againEmotions that have brought me hereLost somewhere in timeNever to return againMemories breaking meKill what I used to beFalling back on myselfFor I know no one else
