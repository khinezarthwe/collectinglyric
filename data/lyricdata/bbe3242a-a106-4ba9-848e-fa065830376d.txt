We arrive and are blindedBy twisted rubble and piercing lightScreaming sounds of the sirensRip through the air on this sleepless nightTake this boy and remind himJust how fragile his unsewn lifeHis daily dose of destructionSleeps with his gun, his surrogate wifeMother fears the doorBaby's off at warJust like dad beforeLeft soullessPromised there's an endJust around the bendLost another friendLeft soullessSoulless ghost in the airHelpless feeling of despairBroken body, scarred mindThey're soullessMen, women and childrenHuddle together or stand and fightEnemies or our alliesCan't tell the difference, he's blind with frightHe reads letters from motherShares photographs from another lifeFalling to friendly fireToday was this hero's final fightMother fears the doorBaby's off at warJust like dad beforeLeft soullessPromised there's an endJust around the bendLost another friendLeft soullessSoulless ghost in the airHelpless feeling of despairBroken body, scarred mindThey're soullessLeft shamelessLeft namelessLeft faithlessLeft soullessSoulless ghost in the airHelpless feeling of despairBroken body, scarred mindThey're soullessSoulless ghost in the airHelpless feeling of despairBroken body, scarred mindThey're soullessLeft sightlessLeft mindlessLeft heartlessLeft hopelessGone insane, endless painEnter the room to find there's no one leftGuiltless time, poisoned mindMocking clocks they chime, you're in tractionWasted days, again betrayedA once honored hero now stains the mattressNo one calls, blood-stained wallsMother needle holds you to her breastSkin and bonesYour life is left soulless
