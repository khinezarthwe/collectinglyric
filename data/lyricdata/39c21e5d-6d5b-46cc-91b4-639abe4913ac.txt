Waking up, I see you dreaming of a drive-in.Open your eyes to see the TV set in mute.I been waiting for you to smile, all the pretty freezing.Wintertime comes summer, you are why it's happening.Sugar babe, sugar babe, turn the TV.Turn it babe, turn it babe, can't you see me?Sugar now, sugar now, turn the TV.Turn it babe, turn it babe, can't you see me?I feel the morning slip its sights into your mirror.Now I see what you might see, it's pretty clear.I been looking just to feel that funny feeling,I don't know, but it's a mystery to reckon.Sugar babe, sugar babe, turn the TV.Turn it babe, turn it babe, can't you see me?Sugar now, sugar now, turn the TV.Turn it babe, turn it babe, can't you see me?
