Blue sky when you gonna learn to rain?And let yourself go blue for onceAnd let go of the weight you've been carryingIn this house no one goes to sleep for daysIt's like were working on a mountainsideTrying not to slideInto the oceanI can take care of youBut only if you wantI'm strong enough to carry youAcross the icy lake, across the icy lakeBut I can't fight your bluesCause I know I'll loseWhat's left of my mindI can't winBut for you I will tryOh, my baby blueMy mountain is hidden in a pile of treesAnd she's the one I'll have to climbIf I ever wanna seeBlue sky when you gonna learn to rain?And let yourself go blue for onceAnd let go of the pain?I can take care of meThe way you'd like to feelUnderneath the riverbedAcross the icy lake, across the icy lakeBut I can't fight your bluesCause I know I'll loseWhat's left of my mindI can't winBut for you I will tryFor youFor youMy baby blue
