I know a way that you can stay away from meIt's easier than what you heard and what you seeI've been counting (I've been counting)And what I keep (And what I keep)Isn't what you need, knowing what you needBuilding sure-fire hearts into life-like onesI can't complain, explain it's hard to be that wayI can't be that wayI can't believe it's up to me to fade that wayI can't fade that wayReminding me I cannot stayI think it's strange that you could change your mind for meI only bought your line of thought that I could seeYou've been countingOn what I keepIsn't what you need, knowing what you needBuilding sure-fire hearts into life-like onesReminding me I can't stay alone, I don't know what you meanI know I've finally worked it outI can be that way. I can be that wayI know I've asked is this all trueI can fade that way. I can fade that way.
