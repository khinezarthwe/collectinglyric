Take me and let me in,Don't break me and shut me out.So take me and let me inDon't break me and shut me out.I lit my pain on fire and I watched it all burn.Now I'm dancing in the ashes and there's no one else around.'cause I wanna be part of something,This is just a story of a broken soul.As days go by my heart grows cold.I can't seem to let this all pass me by.So take me and let me inDon't break me and shut me out.I'm burning in the heavens.And I'm drowning in a hell.My soul is in a coma and none of my friends can tell, thatI'm reaching out and getting nothing, this is just a story of a broken soulAs days go by my heart grows cold.I can't seem to let this all pass me by.So take me and let me inDon't break me and shut me out.So take me and let me inDon't break me and shut me out.Don't shut me out.Does anyone around me feel the same?Put your fist up and vent your pain! (x4)As days go by my heart grows cold.I can't seem to let this all pass me by.So take me and let me inDon't break me and shut me out.So take me and let me inDon't break me and shut me out.As days go by my heart grows cold.I can't seem to let this all pass me by.Take me!Don't break me!
