Scientists are nihilists with good imaginationsI am satisfied hiding in our friend's apartmentOnly leaving once a day to buy some groceriesDaylight, I'm so absent minded, nighttime meeting new anxietiesSo am I erasing myself? Hope I'm not erasing myselfI guess it would be nice to give my heart to a GodBut which one, which one do I choose?All the churches filled with losers, psycho or confusedI just want to hold the divine in mindAnd forget all of the beauties wastedLet's fall back to earth and do something pleasantWe fell back to earth like gravity's bitches (physics makes us all it's bitches)I guess it would be nice to help in your escapeFrom patterns your parents designedAll the party people dancing for the indie starBut he's the worst faker by far but in the setI forget all of the beauties wastedI guess it would be nice, show me that things can be niceI guess it would be nice (you're trapped), show me that things can be niceYou've got my back in the cityYou've got my back 'cause I don't want to panicYou've got my back in the cityYou've got my back 'cause I don't want to panic
