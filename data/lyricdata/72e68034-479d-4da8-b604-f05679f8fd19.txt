I was so lost, didn't know what to do with myself,I was my own worst enemy, I was lost and oh I needed help,Then you came along, and saw the state I was in,You picked me up, when I was down,Showed me how to live again.I say thank you, for pulling me through,I'm a lucky man,I was strong, and its took me so longFor me to understand,But its precious love, oh its precious loveNo I can't let it go,This is precious love, and its teaching me,Everything I need to know,This precious love, this precious love,I can't get enough,I'm down on my knees, begging you pleaseTo give me some more of that stuff.Love, love, love, love, love ; precious loveIts love, love, love, love, love ; precious loveI got so distracted, by people all around,Whispering sweet nothings, filling my head with doubts
