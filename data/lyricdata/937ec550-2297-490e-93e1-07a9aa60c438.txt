Brooklyn we go hardWe on the look for the advantage, we work hardAnd if we seem to rough it up a bitWe broke but we rich at heartPull ourselves up now we won't chokeIt's our time, put the lights on usWar tactics, they make me sickReel your heart in, run away with itSmile in your face, undermine your backGot guns for the strength they lackSo if you know another wayYou can't look the other wayYou know another way,Tell them so right to their faceI pay for what's calledEccentricity and my wish to evolveI hear them all sayThat I got heartbut not everything that it takesTaint my mind but not my soulTell you I got fireI won't sell it for no payrollLet 'em hold me downI know if I know another wayI can't look the other wayI know another wayI'll tell them so right to their faceSpank Rock:Entirely, totally, bring it all together, I want everything.If it's in, this feels like hot gossip...doesn't mean that we can be poor folks waiting on a trickle with your hands out.I got a life that you can call it luckBecause it wasn't due to you don't mean I ain't paying dues, you stupid fuck.I'm ...things that you can't.Just know I'm doing something you ain't simple and plain.
