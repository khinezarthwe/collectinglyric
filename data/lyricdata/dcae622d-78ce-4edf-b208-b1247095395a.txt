When you feel safeWhen you feel warmThat's when I riseThat's when I crawlGliding on mistHardly a soundBringing the kissEvil's aboundIn the dead of nightLove bites, love bitesIn the dead of nightLove bitesInto your roomWhere in deep sleepThere you lie stillTo you I creepThen I descendClose to your lipsAcross you I bendYou smile as I sipNow you are mineIn my controlA taste of your lifeAnd I own your soulSoftly you stirGently you moanLust in the airWake as I groanIn the dead of nightLove bites, love bitesIn the dead of nightLove bitesIn the dead of nightLove bites, love bitesIn the dead of nightLove bitesLove bites you, invites youTo feast in the nightExcites you, delights youIt drains you to whiteLove bitesYou knew at first sightYou'd enjoy my attackThat with my first biteThere'd be no turning backSo come in my armsI strike any hourI will returnTo trap and devourIn the dead of nightLove bites, love bitesIn the dead of nightLove bitesIn the dead of nightLove bites, love bitesIn the dead of nightLove bitesLove bitesLove bitesLove bitesLove bitesLove bitesLove bitesLove bitesLove bitesAh, ha ha ha
