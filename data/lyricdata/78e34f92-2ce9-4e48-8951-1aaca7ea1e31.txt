And you stare at meIn your Jesus Christ poseArms held outLike you've been carrying a loadAnd you swear to meYou don't wanna be my slaveBut you're staring at meLike ILike I need to be savedArms held outIn your Jesus Christ poseThorns and shroudLike it's the coming of the LordAnd I swear to youThat I would never feed you painBut you're staring at meLike ILike I'm driving the nailsIn your Jesus Christ poseArms held outIn your Jesus Christ poseThorns and shroudLike it's the coming of the lordWould it pay you more to walk on waterThan to wear a crown of thornsIt wouldn't pain me more to bury you richThan to bury you poorIn your Jesus Christ pose
