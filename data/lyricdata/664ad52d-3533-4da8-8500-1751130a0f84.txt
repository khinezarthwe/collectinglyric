I feel like there is no need for conversationSome questions are better left without a reasonAnd I would rather reveal myself than my situationNow and then I consider, my hesitationThe more the light shines through meI pretend to close my eyesThe more the dark consumes meI pretend I'm burning, burning brightI wonder if the things I did were just to be differentTo spare myself of the constant shame of my existenceAnd I would surely redeem myself in my desperationHere and now I'll express, my situationThe more the light shines through meI pretend to close my eyesThe more the dark consumes meI pretend I'm burning brightThe more the light shines through meI pretend to close my eyesThe more the dark consumes meI pretend I'm burning, burning brightThere's nothing ever wrongBut nothing's ever rightSuch a cruel contradictionI know I cross the linesIt's not easy to defineI'm born to indecisionThere's always something newSome path I'm supposed to chooseWith no particular rhyme or reasonThe more the light shines through meI pretend to close my eyesThe more the dark consumes meI pretend I'm burning brightThe more the light shines through meI pretend to close my eyesThe more the dark consumes meI pretend I'm burningI feel like there is no need for conversation...
