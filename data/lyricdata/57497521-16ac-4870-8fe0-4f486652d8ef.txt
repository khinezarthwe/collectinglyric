Winding your way down on Baker StreetLight in your head and dead on your feetAnother crazy dayYou drink the night awayAnd forget about everythingThis city's dance makes you feel so coldIt's got so many people but it's got no soulAnd it's taken you so longTo find out you were wrongWhen you thought it had everythingYou used to think that it was so easyYou used to say that it was so easyBut you're trying, you're trying nowAnother year and then you'll be happyJust one more year and then you'll be happyBut you're crying, you're crying nowWay down the street there's a light in his placeOpens the door, he's got that look on his faceAnd he asks where you've beenYou tell him who you've seenAnd you talk about everythingHe's got this dream about buying some landHe's gonna give up the crack and the one night standsAnd then he'll settle downIn this quiet little townAnd forget about everythingBut you know he'll always keep movingYou know, he's never gonna stop moving'Cause he's rolling, he's a rolling stoneAnd when you wake up, it's a new morningThe sun is shining, it's a new morningYou're going, you're going home
