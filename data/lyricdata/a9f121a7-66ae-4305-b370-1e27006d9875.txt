GoA rush of blood to my headLeaves me winded and wantingTo feel the weakness in my bodyBeaten and crushed like my soulI walked the streets flirting deathBut I never kissed backI'm so lucky, so cursed, so fucked upBut that's the way that it goesIt's the ebb and the flowI wish that I could give you my timeGive you my timeSeems that doomsday's come early this yearThe last angel has gone (angel has gone)I can't remember the last time I criedThe last angel has gone home (angel has gone)The memories stacking upAnd they pull at my gutsWhat do I have to do to end itThe better days hacked awayLeaving me only painThis regret is never endingBut in the blink of an eyeThis life passes you byI wish that I could give you my timeGive you my timeSeems that doomsday's come early this yearThe last angel has gone (angel has gone)I can't remember the last time I cried (last time I cried)The last angel has gone home (angel has gone)I can't rememberI can't rememberI can't remember the last time I criedSeems that doomsday's come early this yearThe last angel has gone (angel has gone)I can't remember the last time I cried (the last time I cried)The last angel has gone home (angel has gone)The last angel has gone (come early this year) (angel has gone)
