Looking back now I regret,You're a promise that I never kept.Waiting in my room in vain,Time winds back and back again.Outside the school gates,We first met in a basement near the park(Diamonds in the dark)We danced all night and then we kissed,Your smile like diamonds in the dark.It's a long way to fallWhen the words strayNo-one callsWe would have little children,We would be together forever.(Diamonds in the dark)We would live on the Delancy Street,Then you cut your hairAnd it ended there.It's a long way to fall (long way)When the words strayNo-one callsLooking back now I regret,You're a promise that I never kept.Waiting in my room in vain,Time winds back and back again.Now I've nothing left to lose,Clinging to a cliff-faceStaring at your shoesAnd tell me, tell me, tell meDo you feel the same?Or are we just waiting for a day we can't,A day that we can't change.And now there's this no-mans landBetween you and me(Diamonds in the dark)But I still wander betweenThe sheets and streetsAnd other places we've beenIt's a long way to fall (long way to fall)When the words strayNo-one calls (such a long way to fall)It's a long way to fall (long way to fall)When the words strayNo-one callsLooking back now I regret,You're a promise that I never kept.Waiting in my room in vain,Time winds back and back again.Back and back again,Back and back again,Back and back again,Back again
