I caught a glimpse of past and future but I did not understand.Darkness and light, blindness and sight, not everything is so black and white.Separate the truth from lies with the stories written between the linesOnly you can tell the wrong from rightThe more you look the more you findClose your eyes and drift away where the lights are taking you no one can say.In the depths of the your mind, looking for a sign written in between the linesWith canyons stretched below us, the stars will be our guideWe'll tear the mountains from the sea and fall into the skyWe'll drift into the airwaves between the earth and moon, where satellites are sending visions down into your roomSeparate the truth from lies with the stories written between the linesOnly you can tell the wrong from rightThe more you look the more you findClose your eyes and drift away where the lights are taking you no one can say.In the depths of the your mind, looking for a sign written in between the lines
