Oh, my child thirty years todayYou came into my life and everything changedIf there's one thing I tried to teach youGirl, don't you waste your timeCome this September you'll be somebody's wifeI won't paint a pictureOf what you want to seeLove is the harder timesTake it from meI would run down the lane and into the nightRun so fast, I swear my feet would flyRun from my babies asleep in their bedsRun from my lover and my best friendAnd back againAnd all of this courage I've tried so hard to hold on toEver since that day you and your brother left for schoolThey say just over that hill the fog rolled inAnd come quick doctor, we think somebody's been killedAnd I have been a healerOf other people's painYeah, I know sometimes you don't likeThe ways I've changedBut the smell of the world came into my lungsThe sound of the gravel when my legs went numbAnd my heart nearly burst right out of my chestIt felt so good to know I wasn't deadI would run down the lane and into the nightRun so fast, I swear my feet would flyRun from my babies asleep in their bedsRun from my lover and my best friendAnd back againBack again
