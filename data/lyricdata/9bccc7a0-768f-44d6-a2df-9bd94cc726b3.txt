They call, they call me the fat man'Cause I weight two hundred poundsAll the girls they love me'Cause I know my way aroundI was standin', I was standin' on the cornerOf Rampart and CanalI was watchin', watchin'Watchin' all these creole galsWah wah wah, wah wahWah wah waah, wah wah wahWah wah waah, wah wah wahWah wah wahWah waaa-ah wahWah wah wah, wah wah wahWah wah wah, wah wah wahWah wah wahI'm goin', I'm goin' goin' awayAnd I'm goin', goin' to stay'Cause women and a bad lifeThey're carrying this soul away.
