I don't believeYou when you sayThat you don't knowWhat you wantI try to understandWhy you areNever happy You liveYour life in fantasyAnd glass cathedralsWhy don't you come down fromYour cloud And face realityI want I loveI need I breatheI lust I trustI cheat I bleedBehind the walls theyBuilt for you You live yourOrchestrated life inside your heartYou know it's wrong But you can'tStop it Your soul it longs forSomething more But you can't find itAnd so you blame me for it allAnd choose anotherI want I loveI need I breatheI lust I trustI cheat I bleed
