Gasoline, lemonade in the latest creamWash on wax off to a different schemeLaminate your mind as though you need itPsycho killer says it makes your shadow seem greyWhy you late in this raceIt's like delay over your faceIt's like you made no wayIt's like you made okayChorusI'm gonna I'm gonna get free this timeI'm gonna I'm gonna give you all my loveI'm gonna get free this timeI'm gonna I'm gonna give you all my loveI'm gonna..... I'm gonna....I'm gonna give gonna give you all my love I'm gonna give gonna give you all my loveI'm gonna give I'm gonna give u all my loveI'm gonna hang around and watch when you get shot in flamesI'll let you wear my capeRecycle this if you're making the manGet a big red slap from his big white handsRecycle this if you're breaking the ban let your girlfriend do what your boyfriend can'tChorus
