I'm having trouble trying to sleepI'm counting sheep but running outAs time ticks byStill I tryNo rest for cross tops in my mindOn my own, here we goMy eyes feel like they're gonna bleedDried up and bulging out my skullMy mouth is dryMy face is numbFucked up and spun out in my roomOn my own, here we goMy mind is set on overdriveThe clock is laughing in my faceA crooked spineMy senses dulledPassed the point of deliriumOn my own, here we goMy eyes feel like they're gonna bleedDried up and bulging out my skullMy mouth is dryMy face is numbFucked up and spun out in my roomOn my own here we goSomebody keep my balanceI think I'm falling offInto a state of regressionThe expiration dateRapidly coming upIt's leaving me behind to rankAlways move forwardGoing "straight" will get you nowhereThere is no progressEvolution killed it allI found my place in nowhereI'm taking one step sidewaysLeading with my crutchGot a fucked up equilibriumCount down from 9 to 5Hooray! We're gonna die!Blessed  into our extinctionAlways move forwardGoing "straight" will get you nowhereThere is no progressEvolution killed it allI found my place in nowhereAlways move forwardGoing "straight" will get you nowhereThere is no progressEvolution killed it allI found my place in nowhereIn nowhere! In nowhere!
