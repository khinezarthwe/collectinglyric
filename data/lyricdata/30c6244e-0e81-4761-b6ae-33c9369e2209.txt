I'm howling at the moon,Gotta give me someone else to fill your little shoesI'm crawling out the door,Don't wanna sleep alone tonight and die here on my ownThe night turns us into animals - I've got one thing on my mindThe night turns us into animals - I've got one thing left to findI'm chasing faces here,I've gotta fill the empty space you made when you disappearedI'm lying through my teeth,I've gotta get you to believe that you're the same as meThe night turns us into animals - I've got one thing on my mindThe night turns us into animals - I've got one thing left to findAnd if you think your not the same,as all of us who lie here in waitI don't believe you're in control,we're only animals after all...
