The years answers melts, in a wet, winter kiss.January and december, you and me forever.My horse is as tall as a wall fully recovered from the fall.Hit record and watch him crawl, into your pocket.If you hold me like you planned too, never let me go.What i want to know is when this pub closes.My horse is as high as a house, with the furniture burning and the windows smashed out.Hit pause and walk him out, out of your pocket.If you hold me like you planned too, never let me go.What i want to know, is when this pub closes.If you hold me like you planned too, never let me go.What i want to know is when this pub closes.When this pub closes
