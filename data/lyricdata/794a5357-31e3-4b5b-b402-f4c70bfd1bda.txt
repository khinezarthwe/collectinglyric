I've lived my life in a cageFreedom spit in my faceIt was such a disgraceAnd I was lonelyBurnt out and emptyDesperateI had my head in a nooseI had nothing to loseHad enough of abuseSo now I'm dangerousHate's so contagiousIt owns usI'm angryI'm ragingI'm breaking through the painThe Monster Is LooseAnd now you know the truthTell me can you feel itAs you hit the wallThe Monster Is LooseAnd now you have to chooseAnd prove that you can take itTo the top before you fallI've walked a slippery roadWith revenge in my soulThrough the wind and the coldWith no protectionJust one directionDestructionI've paid for all my mistakesTaken all I can takeTill I'm ready to breakLife can be viciousIt's so outrageousIt breaks usI'm bleedingStill breathingI'm tearing through these chainsI've lived a thousand years in darknessBanished all aloneInside my mind with just my madnessBehind these walls of stoneI was falling apart at the seamsHolding my breath just to breatheTasted the sting of my tearsI was waking up stuck in a dreamRan out of air, couldn't screamWasted away by my fearsThe Monster Is LooseYou've lost your last excuseNow show me that you've got itEven if you crawlThe Monster Is LooseThis game is win or loseThe time has come to do itAnd show the world you want it allYeah
