One two three fourOh you get me readyIn your '56 ChevyWhy don't we go sit down in the shadeTake shelter on my front porchThe dandelion sun scorchingLike a glass of cold lemonadeI will do the laundryIf you pay all the billsWhere is my John WayneWhere is my prairie songWhere is my happy endingWhere have all the cowboys goneWhy don't you stay the eveningKick back and watch the T.V.And I'll fix a little something to eatOhh I know your back hurtsFrom working on the tractorHow do you take your coffee my sweetI will raise the childrenIf you pay all the billsWhere is my John WayneWhere is my prairie songWhere is my happy endingWhere have all the cowboys goneI am wearing my new dress tonightBut you don't, but you don't even notice meSay our goodbyesSay our goodbyesSay our goodbyesWe finally sell the ChevyWhen we had another babyAnd you took that job in TennesseeYou made friends at the farmAnd you join them at the barAlmost every single day of the weekI will wash the dishesWhile you go have a beerWhere is my John WayneWhere is my prairie songWhere is my happy endingWhere have all the cowboys goneWhere is my Marlboro ManWhere is his shiny gunWhere is my lonely rangerWhere have all the cowboys goneWhere have all the cowboys goneWhere have all the cowboys gone
