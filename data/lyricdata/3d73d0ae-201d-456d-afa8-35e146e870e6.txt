You can look to the left and look to the rightBut you will live in danger tonightWhen the enemy comes, he will never be heardHe'll blow your mind and not say a wordBlinding lights, flashing coloursSleepless nightsIf the man with the powerCan't keep it under controlSome heads are gonna rollSome heads are gonna rollSome heads are gonna rollSome heads are gonna rollThe power-mad freaks who are ruling the earthWill show little, they think you're worthWith animal lust, they'll devour your lifeAnd slice your world to bits like a knifeOne last day, burning hellfireYou're blown awayIf the man with the powerCan't keep it under controlSome heads are gonna rollSome heads are gonna rollSome heads are gonna rollSome heads are gonna rollKnow what it's likeWhen you're taken for grantedThere goes your lifeIt's so underhandedIf the man with the powerCan't keep it under controlSome heads are gonna rollSome heads are gonna rollSome heads are gonna rollSome heads are gonna rollSome heads are gonna rollNo, noNo, noNo, noSome heads are gonna rollNo, noNo, noSome heads are gonna rollNo, noNoSome heads are gonna rollNo, no
