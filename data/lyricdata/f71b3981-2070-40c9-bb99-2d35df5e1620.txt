Tearing beneath your feetFeel the ground split and crack and crumble beneath youCalamity serves a nightmareNever to wake from these dreams of destiny[Chorus:]All are buriedNew earth's eyes turn blackStruggle to cling to your mindGrasping at twines to hold your world togetherReplacing the truthBreathe in the proofAnd pray your god is forever[Chorus:]All are silentFull with old dirtAll are stifledEarth's hand turns to fistForget, erase, the monster you made and the hate that you saveIn time, you'll find, you'll learn to grow in the new worldUshering in the sunBarren earth smiles and greets it's warmth with awarenessGathering clouds, earth drinks the rainAnd plans the birth of it's New Godz[Chorus:]All arisingPurged of sicknessSoil transcendingCast fulfillingAll are presentBorn of earthNew Godz
