What is wrong with you,Can't we both just get alongI see the hesitation in your eyesTake me back againMaybe we can work it outYou know I hate to see you when you cry(Chorus)Slit my wrists and I'll just fade awayThe Carolina's where I want to layAnd if I walk away from here, I'll never be the sameCan't you see it's not about youI'm so sick of itOne more fight and all these problemsIs there anything you likeHave you had enoughI'd give my life for one last touchOpen up cause I'm comin' in(Chorus)Late night masqueradesA quite scene and your devotionYou fall asleep, I hold you closerTeenage waste land, aren't we crazy nowI can't carry on, don't you know that I still love youWe can make it here tonightLet's just run away, back to everything we lived forJust let go and close your eyesClose your eyes(Chorus X2)Can't you see it's not about you (X2)
