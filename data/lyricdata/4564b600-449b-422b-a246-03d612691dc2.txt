I am your inner fear,your kind refuse to hear.I am the light, I am the way,but the fallacies of menare easy to embrace.And I am purest form.I always weather every storm.And though you fail to see,the truth is the path that leads to me.Mankind's dishonesty lays them to waste.(I will divide.)I am the truth,and I walk alone.Human hypocrisy, exacting their fate.(I will devour.)I am the truth,and I walk alone.The flaws in your design,are breeding fear inside your mind.And lies lead to disgrace:a failure to inform, the failed true man.Mankind's dishonesty lays them to waste.(I will divide.)I am the truth,and I walk alone.Human hypocrisy, exacting their fate.(I will devour.)I am the truth,Mankind's dishonesty lays them to waste.(I will divide.)I am the truth,and I walk alone.Human hypocrisy, exacting their fate.(I will devour.)I am the truth,and I walk alone.
