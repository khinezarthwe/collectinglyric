Welcome a dawnSun shining downBut it's 3amICBMIt's getting so much hotterThe mercury singsGreen bricks, dirty soundsIt's time to make for safer groundAll, All aboard row heavy waterTo go homeClouds of white, they settle to dustFlowers spreading seedsOh and sick diseaseIf I could bury deep enoughStraight and arrow through the coreIt's time to leave for pearly shoresIt's time to make for safer ground
