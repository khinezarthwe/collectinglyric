Andy would bicycle across townIn the rain to bring you candyAnd John would buy the gownFor you to wear to the promWith Tom the astronomer, who'd name a star for youBut I'm the luckiest guyOn the Lower East Side'Cause I've got wheelsAnd you want to go for a rideHarry is the one I think you'll marryBut it's Chris that you kissed after schoolWell, I'm a fool, there's no doubtBut when the sun comes outAnd only when the sun comes outI'm the luckiest guyOn the Lower East Side'Cause I've got wheelsAnd you want to go for a rideThe day is beautiful and so are youMy car is ugly but then I'm ugly tooI know you'd never give me a second glanceBut when the weather's nice all the other guys don't stand a chanceI know Professor Blumen makes you feel like a womanBut when the wind is in your hair you laugh like a little girlSo you share secrets with Lou, but we've got secrets tooWell, one: I only keep this heap for you'Cause I'm the ugliest guyOn the Lower East SideBut I've got wheelsAnd you want to go for a rideWant to go for a ride?Want to go for a ride?Want to go for a ride?
