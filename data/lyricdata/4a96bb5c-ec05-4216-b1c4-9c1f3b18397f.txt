What started as a whisperSlowly turned into a screamSearching for an answerWhere the question is unseenI don't know where you came fromAnd I don't know where you've goneOld friends become old strangersBetween the darkness and the dawnAmen OmenWill I see your face againAmen OmenCan I find the place withinTo live my life without youI still hear you sayingAll of life is a chanceAnd is sweetestWhen at a glanceBut I live a hundredLifetimes in a dayBut I die a littleIn every breath that I takeAmen OmenWill I see your face againAmen OmenCan I find the place withinTo live my life without youI listen to a whisperSlowly drift awaySilence is the loudestParting word you never sayI put your worldInto my veinsNow a voiceless sympathyIs all that remainsAmen OmenWill I see your face againAmen OmenCan I find the place withinTo live my life without you
