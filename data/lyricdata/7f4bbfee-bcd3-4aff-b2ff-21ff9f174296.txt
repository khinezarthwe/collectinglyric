I live on the cracks in your fassadeMy nature is deceitI cheatAnd surrounded by snowflakesI turn up the heatA beautiful crystal in my eyeAmends my sightIntensifyMultiplyI might look into your faceBut I see the skyWithout you - day is nothing but a waste of lightWithout you - I am lost, I vanish in the nightWithout you - life is but a senseless waste of timeWithout you - everything I dream turns black and whiteI sit on the steps to your mansardMy fate is disbeliefI grieve(And) Surrounded by snowflakesYou turn off the heatI spin in the currents of my lifeLove shape whiteIntensifyMultiplyI don't look into your faceThere's no reason why
