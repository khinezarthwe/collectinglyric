Cradle me, I'll cradle youI'll win your heart with a woo-wooPulling shapes just for your eyesSo with toothpaste kisses and linesI'll be yours and you'll beLay with me, I'll lay with youWe'll do the things that lovers doPut the stars in our eyesAnd with heart shaped bruises and late night kissesDivine
