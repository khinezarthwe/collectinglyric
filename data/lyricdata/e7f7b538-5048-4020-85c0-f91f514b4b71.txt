A sad fact widely knownThe most impassionate songTo a lonely soulIs so easily outgrownBut don't forget the songsThat made you smileAnd the songs that made you cryWhen you lay in aweOn the bedroom floorAnd say: "Oh, smother me, Mother!"The passing of timeAnd all of its crimesIs making me sad againThe passing of timeAnd all of its sickening crimesIs making me sad againBut don't forget the songsThat made you cryAnd the songs that saved your lifeYes, you're older nowAnd you're a clever swineBut they were the only ones who ever stood by youThe passing of time leaves empty livesWaiting to be filledThe passing of timeLeaves empty livesWaiting to be filledI'm here with the causeI'm holding the torchIn the corner of your roomCan you hear me?And when you're dancing and laughingAnd finally livingHear my voice in your headAnd think of me kindlyDo you love meLike you used to?(You're cleverEverybody's clever nowadays)(You Are SleepingYou do not want to believeYou are sleeping)
