(Oh! Take me back to dear old Blighty,Put me on the train for London Town,Take me anywhere,Drop me anywhere,Liverpool, Leeds or Birmingham'Cause I don't care,I should like to see my...I don't bless them)(Farewell...)to this land's cheerless marshesHemmed in like a boar between archesHer very Lowness with her head in a slingI'm truly sorry but it sounds like a wonderful thingI say: "Charles, don't you ever craveTo appear on the front of the Daily MailDressed in your Mother's bridal veil?"And so I checked all the registered historical factsAnd I was shocked into shame to discoverHow I'm the 18th pale descendantOf some old queen or otherOh has the world changed or have I changed?Oh has the world changed or have I changed?As some 9-year old tough who peddles drugs(I swear to God, I swear)I never even knew what drugs wereAnd so I broke into the PalaceWith a sponge and a rusty spannerShe said: "Eh, I know you and you cannot sing!"I said: "That's nothing, you should hear me play piano!"We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dryAnd talk about precious thingsBut when you're tied to your Mother's apronNo one talks about castrationWe can go for a walk where it's quiet and dryAnd talk about precious thingsLike love and law and povertyOh, ohThese are the things that kill meWe can go for a walk where it's quiet and dryAnd talk about precious thingsBut the rain that flattens my hairOhThese are the things that kill me(All their life, they make love, and pierce through me)Passed the Pub that saps your bodyAnd the church who'll snatch your moneyThe Queen is dead, boysAnd it's so lonely on a limbPassed the Pub that wrecks your bodyAnd the church - all they want is your moneyThe Queen is dead, boysAnd it's so lonely on a limb(Life is very long when you're lonely)(Life is very long when you're lonely)(Life is very long when you're lonely)(Life is very long when you're lonely)
