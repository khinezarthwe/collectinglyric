Oh lord is it what we really want?I fear the bones inside your bodyI feel them grow.Oh lord there's a terror in the darkI fear there's nothing in our loveI feel it grow.In your limbs and arms and bonesI know that we're strongThinking "What's the harm?"There's a fire in my chestIt will extinguish when you're deadIt's you I love to holdBefore the bones they slowly grow.Oh lord is it what we really want?I fear the bones inside your bodyI feel them grow.Oh lord there's a terror in the darkI fear there's nothing in our loveI feel it grow.In your limbs and arms and bonesI know that we're strongThinking "What's the harm?"And I heard you'll grow oldYour muscles turn to bonesTrapped in a pretty poseAnd in your family homeI dreamt of our love aloneAnd singing to just oneIt's you I love to holdBefore the bones crush your throat.
