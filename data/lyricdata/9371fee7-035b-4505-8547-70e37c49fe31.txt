Rose lived on the south side of townUntil her landlord showed up with two hundred dollar billsA notice of eviction on the other handNow she don't live there no more,And everyone thinks he drowned,I pulled into Mecklenburg on them trainsInto a station that got flooded when they opened up the damAnd broke their connections to the railway linesSo they could blast into the quarry,And for every load of granite,We got a ton of worryOne night at the diner over eggs,Over easy she showed me the length of her legs,But that gold plated cross on her neck, it was realAnd you don't get that kind of money from pushing mealI should've told him that you were the one for me,But I lied, But I lied,To most any drifter whose looking for work is too weirdI met your sister and I married her in JulyBut if only to be closer to you, CarolinePercy and I moved down the streetUntil we lost two pretty girlsOne was seven and one was threeAlderman and Caroline owned the house right up the hillWhere we laid those babies downSo they could still see our houseSuspicion got the best of old Alderman HaintHe owned an auto parts store off the interstateBut the lord took him home in JulyAnd then Rose spilled the beans on the day that he diedand we was in troubleI should've told him that you were the one for meBut I lied, But I liedTied up to concrete at the bottom of the quarryWith a tattoo on his heart that spelled out "Caroline"He was silent but his rosary well itDrifted into the custodyOf a sheriff that was just deputizedAnd I was down at the banquet hallWhen two guys came up, pretty angry and drunkAnd I'm still here at the banquet hallAt the banquet hallWhere the gun went off, in the Carolina RainIn the Carolina Rain, in the Carolina RainOh, Caroline
