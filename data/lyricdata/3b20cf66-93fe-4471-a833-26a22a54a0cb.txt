Well I'm back in the class, falling out of your pastAll the letters I wrote and you thought as a jokeAnd the phone never rings when your cold and it stingsAll the holidays sucked *by myself* cause I'm fuckedAnd I'm dying, dying, dyingSo how does it feel, how does it feelCause it's tearing me apartSo how does it feel, how does it feelCause it's tearing me apartAnd I'm back for some more round two was a boreAnd you're driftin' away cause you want it that wayAnd I'm picking up pieces of hearts that completelyHave broken in twoSo it must've been youWhile you're lying in bed with somebodySo how does it feel, how does it feelCause it's tearing me apartSo how does it feel, how does it feelCause it's tearing me apartYou Cannot convince me anymoreYou Cannot control me like beforeYou Cannot convince me anymoreYou Cannot control me like beforeSo how does it feel, how does it feelHow does it feelHow does it feel, how does it feelHow does it feelAnd it's 1:45 and I'm feeling aliveI've got it all and its your last callThere's somebody new and she's better than youYou've been replaced by a prettier faceSo look who's crying nowWe don't wanna be the enemies of what we used to beWe don't wanna be the enemies of what we used to beSo how does it feel, how does it feelCause it's tearing me apartSo how does it feel, how does it feelCause it's tearing me apartSo how does it feel, how does it feel nowSo how does it feel, how does it feel now
