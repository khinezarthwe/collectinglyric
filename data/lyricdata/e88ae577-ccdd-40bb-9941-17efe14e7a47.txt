Man with a crown, the one that always frowns,I'd rather have a hat, than a broken back.Show you a man with a lot on his mind,I'll show you a self confessed trendsetter oh, because the man said no.Live like a king for a day, skint for the rest of the week.Say your nothing special, say your lying through your teeth.It's just our way, why should we throw away a sunny day?We should not!It's just our way, why should we throw away a sunny day?It's the realisation your not ten feet tall, the realisation you don't know it all.World domination makes you feel so small,Realisation of it all.Stealing, coppers off your mantelpiece.Stumbling through life without one good deed, and you're not living for tomorrow, dealing with some sorrow.Competing with the neighbours, waiting for that six number saviour oh.Buy some brew with some ill gained currency what a nice way to spend every day never had beamer, never been a dreamer.Your barks worse than, worse than your bite, why should we throw away a sunny day? The night has overcome your apocalyptic way.It's the realisation your not ten feet tall, the realisation you don't know it all.World domination makes you feel so small,Realisation of it all.Realisation your not ten feet tall, realisation you don't know it allWorld domination makes you feel so small,Realisation of it all.Take for granted Eagers omen,Stories lost its moment.Take for granted Eagers omen,Stories lost its moment.Take for granted Eagers omen,Dryburgh Stories lost its moment.
