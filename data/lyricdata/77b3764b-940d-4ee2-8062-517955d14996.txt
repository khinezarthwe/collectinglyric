Come back honest James, come back to your town,Take your shadow's mistress from our fertile ground.Never one to cry out, but it's gone on too long.Every song is empty without your friendly tongue.Come back honest James; your brother, he is here.He rode into the darkness and he needs you to be near.Why don't you just tell him what's inside your heart,Let love take over; you know the devil just ain't that smart.And I'll always love him...
