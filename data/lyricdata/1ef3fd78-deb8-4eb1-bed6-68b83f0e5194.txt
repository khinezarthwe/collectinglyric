I'm sorry that I never called you yesterdayIt wasn't that the kiss we shared didn't mean a thingI think about you constantly- you never leave my mindBu the nerve to ask you out again is just so hard to find'Cause you're just way too good for meThat you even look my way is hard to believeI don't know what you see in meA disappointment is all I'll ever beDon't say I didn't warn youwhen this whole thing falls apartJust try and take it easy when you let go of my heart'Cause you're just way too good for meThat you even look my way is hard to believeI don't know what you see in meA disappointment is all I'll ever be
