I was lost, I was hurtI was trapped out at seaI was swimming in circles of circlesIn the last place I wanted to beI was holding on to a love I did so longI thought it must be keeping me afloatOnly when I was dead andOnly when I was drowningI finally feel the hands on my throatI looked my fear in the eyesLooked at the water belowI knew I could love or liveI let it goI let it goI let it goOh-oh oh-ohI walked in the darkI walked in the rainI walked for miles and miles and yearsAll I knew was heartache and painI was waiting with the hate I held so longI thought it must be guiding me homeOnly when I was crossedOnly when I was lostThat I finally see it left me all aloneI looked my fear in the eyesLooked at the cold ground belowI knew I could love or dieI let it goI let it goI let it goOh-oh oh-ohI looked my fear in the eyesLooked at the cold ground belowI knew I could love or dieI let it goI let it goI let it goOh-oh oh-ohYeahI let it goI let it goPour on the floorTo in the airOut of the sandOut of the skyInto the globeI looked my fear in the eyeI looked at the water belowI knew I could love or liveI let it goI let it goI looked my fear in the eyesI looked at the water belowI knew I could love or dieI let it goI let it go
