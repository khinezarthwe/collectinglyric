Lord, you know I've cried a thousand tears tonight,But nothing seems to quench the thirst you keep on craving,But now I need an answer to my prayers and you're not there,So why I think you listen?Listen!Has no one told you, your cries are all in vain,And everyone keeps trying to take that all away,Has no one told you, your cries are all in vain.Your cries!Lord, I can't disguise the look inside my eyes,The more I try to look away the more I'm staring,But now I need an answer to my prayers and you're not there,So why I think you listen?Listen!Has no one told you, your cries are all in vain,And everyone keeps trying to take that all away,Has no one told you, your cries are all in vain.Your cries!You cries in vain.You cries in vain.You cries in vain.You cries in vain.I look away!Has no one told you, your cries are all in vain,And everyone keeps trying to take that all away,Has no one told you, your cries are all in vain.Your cries!Has nobody told you when you look away.The stories they told you still run through your veins.Has nobody told you when you look away.The stories they told you still run through your...Run through your veins!
