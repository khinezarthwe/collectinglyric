Maybe you want to give me kisses sweetBut only for one night with no repeatMaybe you'll go away and never callAnd a taste of honey is worse than none at allOh little girlIn that case I don't want no partI do believe that would only break my heartSo if you feel like loving meIf you've got that notionI second that emotionSo if you feel like giving meA life-time of devotionI second that emotionMaybe you think that love will tie you downAnd you don't seem to like to hang aroundOr maybe you think thot love was made for foolsSo it makes you wise to break the rulesI second that emotionI second that emotionI second that emotion(Oh little girl)
