So far awayCome on I'll take you far awayLet's get awayCome on let's make a get awayOnce you have loved someone this muchYou doubt it could fadeDespite how much you'd like it toGod how you'd like it to fadeLet's fade togetherLet’s fade foreverLet's fade togetherLet’s fade foreverLet's fade togetherIf we get awayYou know we might just stay awaySo stay awakeWhy the hell should I stay awake?When you're far awayOh god you are so far awayI looked at your wallSaw that old passport photographI look like I've just jumped the Berlin WallBerlin I love youI'm starting to fadeLet's fade togetherLet’s fade foreverLet's fade togetherLet’s fade foreverLet's fade togetherLet’s fade foreverLet's fade together
