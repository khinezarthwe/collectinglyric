This is the oneIn the early morning rainWith a dollar in my handAnd an aching in my heartAnd my pockets full of sandI'm a long way from homeLord, I miss my loved ones soIn the early morning rainWith no place to goOut on runway number nineSeven-O-seven set to goBut I'm stuck here on the groundWhere the cold wind blowsNow the liquor tasted goodAnd the women all were fastThere she goes my friendShe'll be rolling down at lastHear the mighty engines roarSee the silver bird on highShe's away and westward boundFar above the clouds she'll flyWhere the morning rain don't fallAnd the sun always shinesShe'll be flying over my homeIn about three hours timeSo the airports got me downIt's no earthly good to me'Cause I'm stuck here on the groundBored and drunk as I can beYou can't jump a jet planeLike you can a freight trainSo I'd best be on my wayIn the early morning rain
