How many words did you come up with today?How many words do you want to hear tonight?You flare up but beneath lies defeat.I see your eyes now and they are calm.I've answered enough phones for one life.I've worn too many ties around my neck.I wake up and I find a trace of you there.So sullen, your words haunt the airI wake up and I find a trace of you there.So sullenTaking long walks in perfect silence.Joined together in useless harmony.Your hard breath means that you're upset.An overheated North-West bliss.But I've answered enough phones for one life.I've worn too many ties around my neck.Just wait and see.I don't know much about braveryBut I'll raise you upWith my bad jokes and loose promises.She said to think of her when I'm aloneBut I'm never aloneWhen I want to be.I wake up and I find a trace of you there.So sullen, your words haunt the airI wake up and I find a trace of you there.So sullen, your words haunt the airYour words haunt the air
