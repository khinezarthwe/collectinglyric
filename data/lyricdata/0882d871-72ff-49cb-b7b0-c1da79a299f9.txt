Denial waits, it's here to claim me nowAs I crawl down to hell,For a chance that you'll come around,And lay down tonight.But I'm left telling myself that everything will be alrightRun away from the way that you love meWith no regretsJust walk away don't wanna hear that you're sorry,From words unsaidSo stay away, I know you wanna destroy meAnd fade awayCause I know.If I just closed my eyesI'll still see your lips saying "Everything will be alright."If I saw you right now, I'm embarrassed to sayI'd take you back and we could just pretend you never went awayRun away from the way that you love meWith no regretsJust walk away don't wanna hear that you're sorry,From words unsaidSo stay away, I know you wanna destroy meJust save your breathCause I know.Denial waits, it's here to claim you nowDenial waits, it's here to claim you nowRun away from the way that you love meWith no regretsJust walk away don't wanna hear that you're sorry,From words unsaidDenial waitsDenial waits
