Lost in the high street, where the dogs runRoaming suburban boysMother's got her hair-do to be doneShe says they're too old for toysStood by the bus stop with a felt penIn this suburban hellAnd in the distance a police carTo break the suburban spellLet's take a rideAnd run with the dogs tonightIn suburbiaYou can't hideRun with the dogs tonightIn suburbiaBreak the window by the Town HallListen, a siren screamsThere in the distanceLike a roll callOf all the suburban dreamsLet's take a rideAnd run with the dogs tonightIn suburbiaYou can't hideRun with the dogs tonightIn suburbiaI only wanted something else to do but hang aroundI only wanted something else to do but hang aroundIt's on the front page of the papersThis is their hour of needWhere's a policeman when you need oneTo blame the colour TV?Let's take a rideAnd run with the dogs tonightIn suburbiaYou can't hideRun with the dogs tonightIn suburbiaSuburbiaWhere the suburbs met utopiaWhat kind of dream was this?So easy to destroy?And who are were to blameFor the sins of the past?These slums of the future?SuburbiaWhere the suburbs met utopiaSuburbiaWhere the suburbs met utopia
