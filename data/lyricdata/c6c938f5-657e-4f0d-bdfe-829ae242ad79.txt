No one likes to be aloneComing down on the telephone.Across the city across the sea,Come back baby connect to me.Wrote you a letter sent to your heart,Backwards rewinds to the start:Sweet little words of therapyTo come back baby connect to me.And the phone callsAnd the shooting stars:We'll be fine.Oh, yeah, nevermind, just nevermind.And the phone callsAnd the shooting stars:We'll be fine.Oh, yeah, nevermind, just nevermind.And the phone callsAnd the shooting stars:We'll be fine.Oh, yeah, nevermind, just nevermind.No one likes to be alone,But coming down's better on your own.
