What'll I do if you never wanna come backSittin' in a city that is always on the attackWhat'll I do if you never want me backCome with me come back we'll live againAnd what if I'm only satisfied when I'm at homeSittin' in a city that'll never let me goWhat if I'm only satisfied when I'm at homeWhat'll I do if you never find me againSittin' in a Province a million miles from my friendsWhat'll I do if you never want me againCome with me come back we'll live againWhat if I'm only satisfied when I'm at homeSittin' in a city that'll never let me goWhat if I'm only satisfied when I'm aloneLate at nightSink your heart into mineI will never tryTo forget your northern lightsHey tonightSync your heartbeat to mineI will never tryTo forget your northern lightsRun away againFrom this Alberta penAnd I will never tryTo forget your northern eyesRun away againFrom this Alberta penAnd I will never tryTo forget your northern eyesMeet me there againUnder the lights at the ledgeAnd we will burn our eyesSeeking out these purple nightsMeet me there againUnder the lights at the LegAnd we will burn our eyesSeeking out these purple nights
