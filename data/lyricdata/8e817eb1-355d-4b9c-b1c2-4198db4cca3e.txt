The minute before we playI'm pacing, waiting anxiouslyI can't wait to hit the stageAnd say "hello" to jerseyAnd when the last note ringsAnd I've sung all i have to singEvery minute I will countTill the next show in the next townWhat can I sayThat can explainAll this timeI'm loving lifeThere's not a dayThat I can't sayAll this timeI'm living out my...The feeling of screaming outThe words of the things I think aboutHearing them coming backFrom the crowds mouth is perfectAnd when the curtains closeI'll realize how fast time could goThanks for everythingYou know how much this meansWhat can I sayThat can explainAll this timeI'm loving lifeThere's not a dayThat I can't sayAll this timeI'm living out my dreamWhat this is to meIs more than words could meanI guess dreams do come trueThis song itself is living proofWhat this means to meIs more than it may seemI guess dreams do come trueThis song itself is living proofWhat this is to meIs more than words could meanI guess dreams do come trueThis song itself is living proofWhat can I sayThat can explainAll this timeI'm loving lifeThere's not a dayThat I can't sayAll this timeI'm singing outA song aboutA dream that has come true
