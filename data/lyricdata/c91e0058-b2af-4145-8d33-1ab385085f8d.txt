If time is tight it's right to stay another nightYou know the score, I wouldn't want you sleeping on the floorCause living on your own is never any funA house is not a home when you make it what you want toIt's hard to tell if you should make the choice by yourselfCause on your own you only learn to like what you knowYou recognise the smell but as far as you can tellA house becomes hotel when you make it what you want toWhat's the use of going home againWhen it's always the sameIt's getting late so can you show me what I'm missingSay what you see, I'll let you be my refereeSend it through the post, the things you like the mostI'm sure I couldn't prove if you make me what you wanted toWhat's the point of moving home againWhat's the use of going back againWhat's the point of changing face and thenPacking boxes moving home againWhen it's always the same
