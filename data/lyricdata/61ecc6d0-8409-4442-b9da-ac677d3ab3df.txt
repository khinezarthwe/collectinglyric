We danced together on the roof at the partyFive stories removed from the troubles on the streetThe sun arose revealing goose bumps on your armA sign that we should move together somewhere warmWe danced togetherWe danced togetherWe danced togetherWe danced togetherWe danced togetherWe danced togetherWe danced togetherWe danced togetherWe moved to the street where they tried to hold curfewAnd ran among the debris as the bullets flewHelicopters circled overhead to get a better viewWe found a doorway, fell in and I held youWe danced togetherWe danced togetherWe danced togetherWe danced togetherWe danced togetherWe danced togetherWe danced togetherWe danced togetherWe didn't give a shit about what they would sayAnd stayed up until the light turned our eyes greyWe caned our money like it was our last dayTwo fingers up at those who won't miss us when we pass awayWe danced togetherWe danced together on the roof at the partyWe danced togetherWe danced togetherWe danced togetherWe danced togetherWe danced togetherWe danced togetherWe danced togetherWe danced together...We didn't have no where to goWaiting for the daylight to beginSinger, save our secular soulsHow can u have hope with no God?We didn't give a shit about what they would sayAnd stayed up until the light turned our world greyWe caned our money like it was our last dayTwo fingers up at those who won't miss us when we pass awayWe didn't have no where to goWaiting for the daylight to beginSinger, save our secular soulsHow can you have hope with no God?How can you have hope with no God?
