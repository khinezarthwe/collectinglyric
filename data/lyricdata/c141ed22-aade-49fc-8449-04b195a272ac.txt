You speak of loveBut you ain't no loverYou were a friendBut more like a brotherAs the miles passed beneath meThe sounds made so sweetlyCame to an endAnd no man can deny herBut now you're a liarAnd you've no room left to defendWhen I left, I should have known betterThe kind of man that you areYou'd have to get herAnd I know you got a lot of painThat's born inside youBut instead of growing strongerYou let it divide youHow could you be so carelessHow could you be so carelessAnd the waves that are crashingTrue lies and passionWashing on your shoreA line has been crossedA true love's been lostThat I can't get back anymoreAnd I'm sureThat we both still love herIt's a shame we both lost herAnd in turn lost each otherBut a trust has been brokenAnd words have been spokenBut it can't mendAnd no man can deny herAs you laid beside herI hope it felt good my friendHow could you be so carelessHow could you be so carelessHow could you be so carelessWith her heart
