What she saidShe said to meTake me high on a mountain sideShe was dressed up in leopard skinAnd her soul would never be deniedI met her down the disco in a beat up carShe was burning down the roadShe looked just like a star in a JaguarShe needs to lighten her loadAnd when you mightThink you're gonna cryIt will be alrightStep out tonightYou mightThink you're gonna cryIt will be alrightStep out tonightWhat I said I said to herI'm alive when you walk that wayCan you hear what I can hear?It's the sound of a brand new dayShe met me down a disco in a beat up carI was burning down the roadI can be a star in my JaguarI need to lighten my loadBecause you might think you're gonna cryIt will be alrightStep out tonightYou mightThink you're gonna cryIt will be alrightStep out tonightMy whole life's still sinking in the waterYea you're my bitch c'mon rescue me tonightYou mightThink you're gonna cryIt will be alrightStep out tonightYou mightThink you're gonna cryIt will be alrightStep out tonight
