Left alone, your voice once gave me the comfort to continue.2,000 miles, I'm hopeless and brokenYou're gutless and hopin' to run into hopeAnd this isn't getting any easierThey won't understand itWhat you've hidden from them,And this isn't getting any easier.So is this what you wanted?Too bad, it's what you got.So should this be my farewell?Come on, you know me too well.So is this what you wanted?Too bad, it's what you got.So should this be my farewell?Come on, you know me too well.Once again, your lies still give me the heartache to continue.1000 miles, you're coming closerIt's been so long I can hardly rememberThis is getting so much easierThey won't understand it,What you've hidden from themAnd this is getting so much easierSo is this what you wanted?Too bad, it's what you got.So should this be my farewell?Come on, you know me too well.So is this what you wanted?Too bad, it's what you got.So should this be my farewell?Come on, you know me too well.Once again, your lies still give me the heartache to continue.So is this what you wanted?Too bad, it's what you got.So should this be my farewell?Come on, you know me too well.So is this what you wanted?Too bad, it's what you got.So should this be my farewell?Come on, you know me too well.
