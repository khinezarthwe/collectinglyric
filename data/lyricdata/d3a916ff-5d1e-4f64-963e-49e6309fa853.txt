So lately, been wonderingWho will be there to take my place?When I'm gone you'll need loveTo light the shadows on your faceIf a great wave shall fallAnd fall upon us allThen between the sand and stoneCould you make it on your own?If I could then I wouldI'll go wherever you will goWay up high or down lowI'll go wherever you will goAnd maybe I'll find outA way to make it back somedayTo watch you, to guide youThrough the darkest of your daysIf a great wave shall fallAnd fall upon us allThen I hope there's someone out there, ohWho can bring me back to youIf I could then I wouldI'll go wherever you will goWay up high or down lowI'll go wherever you will goRun away with my heartRun away with my hopeRun away with my loveI know now just quite howMy life and love my still go onIn your heart, in your mindI'll stay with you for all of timeIf I could then I wouldI'll go wherever you will goWay up high or down lowI'll go wherever you will goIf I could turn back timeI'll go wherever you will goIf I could make you mineI'll go wherever you will goI'll go wherever you will go
