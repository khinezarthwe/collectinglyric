I should have turned backI should have known betterThan to walk away defeatedI'll say it tonightI'll say it foreverAnd this time I really swear I mean itOh I need you nowThe Earth fell fast asleepThis room is safe and soundWill you lay here with meAnd feel itI think I like todayI think its goodIt's something I can't get my head aroundTrue love is something that comes easyJust one kiss god I swear I want toI heard a pin drop and a nervous heartbeatHave you ever heard me scream I love youI need you nowThe Earth fell fast asleepThis room is safe and soundWill you lay here with me and feel itI think I like todayI think it's goodIt's something I can't get my head arounddadah da dah dah dadadahI think I like todayI think it's goodIt's something I can't get my head around
