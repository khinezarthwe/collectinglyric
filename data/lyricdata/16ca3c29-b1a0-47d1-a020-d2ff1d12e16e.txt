These words roll of my tongue like second nature.But I'm far from my womb, and you know I'm far from you.So when do I come back to you?Was this already written or have I fallen so far?I can't tell the light from the dark.I thought you had me forever.But I'm sure you thought the same about me.And I'm sorry, so sorry.These dreams run through my head that frolic through some tube of my brain.I'm going insane, I've forgotten my name.So I'll use yours, like a dropped friend I wish I never left.I wish I never left you. I wish I never left you.I can't tell the light from the dark.I thought you had me forever.But I'm sure you thought the same about me.And I'm sorry, so sorry.Winter's come early this year.Like a bird in the rain, I've tortured my everything.The rain falls, and I never meant to leave you standing.
