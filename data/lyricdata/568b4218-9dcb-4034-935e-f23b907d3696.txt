Baby!You don't wanna make me cryor I will fill you with the emptiness inside.Okay! Alright!Baby!You don't wanna say goodbyeor I will soak you in this rich formaldehyde.Cause you're beautiful tonightand the stars are burning bright.And I give this curse to youlike there is nothing else to do.So let the purple sky explode.Let it shower with us toads.Let the scarlet river floodso it can drown us all in blood.I just hope you don't,Hope you don't.It's funny,how crazy you make me feel sometimes.I'm so brokenI can barely even rhyme.Okay! Alright!Honey!It's crazy that you take up all my timeGot me sippin' at a gross amount of wine.But you're beautiful tonightand the stars are burning bright.And I give this curse to youlike there's nothing else to do.So let the purple sky explode.Let it shower with us toads.Let the scarlett river floodso it can drown us all in blood.Tonight, I guess, I'm human.So thank you for fightingAnd havin' sex with me.Tonight, I guess, I'm human.So thank you for fightingAnd havin' sex with me.Oh!
