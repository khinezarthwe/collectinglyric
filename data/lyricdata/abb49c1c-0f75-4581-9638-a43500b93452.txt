Nice day; out the window and,I see birds are flying around her,As she moves to the music in her head.Hot temp,Now I’m shivering; cold sweat,Blood raising through my head,Gotta see if I catch her if I can.Girl, girl, girl,You chew my mind up.Girl, girl,And spit my heart out.Blue eyes,Cutting through me like laser,Smile driving me crazy,It’s *something* as she walks by.I’m hooked,Girl, I gotta know your name,Hold her to my chest tonight,Take her with me and *holler/hold on?) to the starsGirl, girl, girl,You chew my mind up.Girl, girl,And spit my heart out.Girl, girl,You chew my mind up.Girl, girl,And spit my heart, baby.Gotta see if I catch her if I can.Girl, girl, girl,You chew my mind up.Girl, girl,And spit my heart out.Girl, girl,You chew my mind up,Girl, girl,And spit my heart, baby
