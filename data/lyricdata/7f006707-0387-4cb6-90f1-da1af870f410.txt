Down in the parkWhere the Machmen meetThe machines are playing 'kill-by-numbers'Down in the park with a friend called 'Fire'I was in a car crashOr was it the war?But I've never been quite the sameLittle white lies like, 'I was there'Come to 'Tom-Tom's'The place to eatLike it was built in one dayYou can watch the humans trying to runOh, look, there's a rape machineI'd go outside if it looked the other wayWouldn't believe the things they doDown in the parkWhere the chant is 'death, death, death''Til the sun cries morningDown in the park with friends of mine'We are not loversWe are not romanticsWe are here to serve you'A different face but the words never change
