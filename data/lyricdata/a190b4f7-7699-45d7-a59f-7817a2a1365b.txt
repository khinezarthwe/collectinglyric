Please don't cryFor the ghost and the storm outsideWill not invade this sacred shrineNor infiltrate your mindMy life down I shall lieIf the bogey-man should tryTo play tricks on your sacred mindTo tease, torment and tantaliseWavering shadows loomA piano plays in an empty roomThere'll be blood on the cleaver tonightAnd when darkness lifts and the room is brightI'll still be by your sideFor you are all that mattersAnd I'll love you till the day I dieThere never need be longing in your eyesAs long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mineCeiling shadows shimmy byAnd when the wardrobe towers like a beast of preyThere's sadness in your beautiful eyesYour untouched, unsoiled, wonderous eyesMy life down I shall lieShould restless spirits tryTo play tricks on your sacred mindI once had a child and it saved my lifeAnd I never even asked his nameI just looked into his wondrous eyesAnd said: "Never never never again"And all too soon I did returnJust like a moth to a flameSo rattle my bones all over the stonesI'm only a beggar-man whom nobody ownsOh see how words as old as sinFit me like a gloveI'm here and here I'll stayTogether we lie, together we prayThere never need be longing in your eyesAs long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mineAs long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mineClimb up on my knee, sonny boyAlthough you're only three, sonny boyYou're - you're mineAnd your mother she just never knewOh, your mother ...As long ... as long ... as longI did my best for herI did my best for herAs long ... as long ... as long asI did my best for herI did my best for her
