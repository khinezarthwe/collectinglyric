Stand looking for a friend,Someone I can rely on,All the people laugh at me,I hide in my room,They don´t understand me,Think that I have gone insane,These four walls are closing on me,Can´t they realize my painConfused, confused, confusedCan´t you see that I´m confusedThe wild state of affairs gets worse and worse day by day,Everybody seems to be confused,Noone ever knows the wayBut still life carries on,And you live a day and you just wait,You only get one chance, don´t let it just slip awayConfused, confused, confusedCan´t you see that I´m confused
