You can't escapeYou're gonna die, you wonder why??!!Might wings beat out thunderous gusts of windMegatron eyes explode in the skies, it begins!Talons like razors are shredding your bones to piecesIs this a dream or is God's telling you it's over?Mothra, Mothra, MothraBuildings are falling, black death is above youYou can't run there's nowhere to goRubble and stone block your pathYou can't escape from it's wrathHot flashes burst, melting down civilizationLeaving destruction and desolationYou're still alive but your luck is running outIt's not a dream God's told you it's overIt's over!!!What can we do?A creature of the nightAre we through?Will this be our plightPlease save us. pleaseWhat did we wrong to you?This holocaust is killing all of usI've sent this beast to purify your kindAnd for your world leave no life behindConquest complete, Mothra is nestingPopulation for future infestingPurification yes it's been achievedFor eternity Mothra reigns supreme
