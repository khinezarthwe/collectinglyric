So this ain't the end - I saw you again todayI had to turn my heart awaySmiled like the Sun - kisses for realAnd tales - it never fails!You lying so low in the weedsI bet you gonna ambush meYou'd have me down on my kneesNow wouldn't you, Barracuda?Back over Time we were all trying for freeMet up with porpoise and meNo right no wrong you're selling a Song - a nameWhisper gameIf the real thing don't do the trickYou better make up something quickYou gonna burn into the wickBarracuda"Sell me sell you" the porpoise saidDive down deep now save my headYou... I think you got the blues too.All that night and all the nextSwam without looking backMade for the western pools -silly foolsIf the real thing don't do the trick No!You better make up something quickYou gonna burn into the wackBarra-Barracuda
