When I was a little boyThey would say to meDon't go in the world and playIt's bad companyAll they had was child and faithLet him grow and let him waitJust to find out what it was to be freeBut now I'm over twenty oneGrowing up I've had my funAnd I know it's got to beBaby lying in a wombAre you free or in a tombLet me in,I feel I want to cry.Oh the road is thereOh the road is thereCome on back, back.Wash your hands and up to bedMind your mannersOr you're deadMind the cars cos you've got school on MondayPut my trust in GodWho is he I know not whatSomething mummy said to me one Sunday.Maybe love is life but life is notsomething I need plenty of.Oh! I wish I'd never lived a day.Now there's no one near me nowTell me what to do and howTake me let me sing my cares away.Oh! the road is thereOh that road is thereCome on back, back.Wash your hands and up to bedMind your mannersOr you're deadMind the cars cos you've got school on MondayBlack is black and white is whiteWhich to choose and which is rightGuide me to a place where I'll stay.Wrap me up and keep me warmHide myself far from the stormSleep and love will keep my mind at rest.Only now I realise what my parents had to try.Love you all and keep you all my life.Oh that road is thereOh the road is thereCome on back, back.
