When I pick up my guitarThis is the song that always comesDon't know what I'm singing 'bout andDon't know what forI think about youAnd I think about RosebudWish there was a song to singTo bring you backBut you can't get here from nowhere I guessRosebud's shipwrecked up on the OhioBehind a wall of glassTelling me to take care of myselfAnd my friendsYou sing to a field of treesAnd roses singing those melodiesSimple and easy where everything movesUnderneath youAnd Rosebud tooI wish there was a song to singTo get you backBut you can't get here from nowhere I guessRosebud's shipwrecked up on the OhioBehind a wall of glassTelling me to take it easyBut I took a photographAnd she's just a wooden machineBut you and Rosebud, you're still singing to me
