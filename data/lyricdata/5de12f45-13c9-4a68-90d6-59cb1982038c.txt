She says she loves meBut she comes and goes when she pleasesWhen the door shutsIt's like another papercutAnd now I'm stuck with a hand full of band-aidsUntil she comes back around like them ceiling fan bladesClaims she loves meBut she cuts me into piecesWhen I'm sewed upHere comes another papercutNow I'm stuck with a hand full of band-aidsUntil she comes back around like them ceiling fan bladesWe met 22 years backFresh out the wombNow she consumes meNo room for self these daysAnd she's so demandingDo this, do thatDon't forget to take your medicineI hate it when her face is invading my head againThe welcome mat reads "please take off your shoes"But she disregards the statementI've grown accustomed to bending my beliefs toSatisfy her needsBut I'm fed upWith plugging cuts every time they bleedSo I dip my pen in the puddleWhat a bloody mess it's beenTrying to end this struggleBut I love herShe's the reason for the lesionsMan I love herI start bleeding when she's leavingAnd every scar on my fingertip is a reminder ofAll the lessons learnedOn my missions to try to find her butI'll sit alone until she comes back homeAnd I'll be waiting by the phone(Phone rings: "Hello?")She says she loves meBut she comes and goes when she pleasesWhen the door shutsIt's like another papercutAnd I'm stuck with a hand full of band-aidsUntil she comes back around like them ceiling fan bladesClaims she loves me butShe cuts me into piecesWhen I'm sewed upHere comes another papercutNow I'm stuck with a hand full of band-aidsUntil she comes back around like them ceiling fan blades(On the Phone)She don't live here no moreI heard she's staying down the street with the dead beatThat don't treat her right with two bad ass kidsGuilt and RegretAnd I'm willing to betMy last album that she's wishing she was kissing meMan the nerve of this bitchPardon my FrenchBut it's been 10 daysAnd I'm getting kind of light headedMaybe I'll write her a letter in a gentleman's wayAnd send it with the hopes that she might get itI can't believe I let her run all over meBut all I think about isWhen she's here and holding meI love herShe's the reason for the lesionsMan I love herI start bleeding when she's leavingAnd every scar on my fingertip is a reminder ofAll the lessons learnedAll my missions trying to find her andI can't complainI kind of like the painShe ain't even got a nameShe just lives in my brainAnd saysShe loves meBut she comes and goes when she pleasesWhen the door shutsIt's like another papercutNow I'm stuck with a hand full of band-aidsUntil she comes back around like them ceiling fan bladesClaims she loves me butShe cuts me into piecesWhen I'm sewed upHere comes another papercutNow I'm stuck with a hand full of band-aidsUntil she comes back around like them ceiling fan bladesShe says she loves me but(She really thinks that I'm an asshole)She says she loves me but(My ears are too big)She says she loves me but(I pick my nose too much)She says she loves me but(She says I never really listen)She says she loves me but(I take too many pills)She says she loves me but(I never pay my bills)She says she loves me but(I wait until the last minute)She says she loves me but(I don't try hard enough)
