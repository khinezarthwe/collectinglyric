Eat Drink and be miserableWhile it's a miracle that we're still here at allAs we sink another belly-fullAnother cherryfalls bouncin' off the wallIf we live in the dead of nightThen it's a constant fight to be a social lad (?)Back tides through darkened roomsWith a look of gloom we'll never leave too soonWe're so scared of finding outWhat scares us and we're growing upAnd knowing what it meansTo be bursting at the seamsSouled up and fueled up to our earsTo leave our fears behindWe all know that that just cannot lastDon't live too fast...Smoke, joke and be unrestrainedAnd when the sun comes up we're gonna feel your painAs we piss it all down the drainFor another week of a tired campaignWe're so interchangableWhen you've seen one well you've seen us allBut that is just the way we like to beIn trouble but trouble-freeWe're so scared of finding outWhat scares us and we're growing upAnd knowing what it meansTo be bursting at the seamsSouled up and fueled up to our earsTo leave our fears behindWe all know that that just cannot lastDon't live too fast...Uh-uh ohhhWe're so scared of finding outWhat scares us and we're growing upAnd knowing what it meansTo be bursting at the seamsSouled up and fueled up to our earsTo leave our fears behindWe all know that that just cannot lastDon't live too fast...
