The octopus in your purseis cursing like an evil sailorBut remember the knife is worsefor the editors of movie trailersAnd if you want me toI'll help it's all the same to mejust tell me if you want me toIf you keep killing God in your eyepeople will think you're really callousBut no matter how hard you tryyou'll never be as weird as Uncle AliceAnd if you want me toI'll help it's all the same to mejust tell me if you want me toI'm not upset just confused and it's so toughI can't relate to this world I'm not bored enoughWatch out the music will complete the change in youTo sing this song in brailleyou have to be haunted by glass frecklesAnd if your color treatment failswell you can always talk to Erik Eckles
