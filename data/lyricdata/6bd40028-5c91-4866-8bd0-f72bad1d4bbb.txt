We talked long behind the Texaco todayShe took us driving down the road for a waysAnd it was fineMy valentineYou’re in my mindLet’s walk out underneath the treetopsYou’re such a heartache,You’re such a teaseSo please believe meWe held hands below the Texaco todayShe said words, yeah, that I reckon, well, just won’t staySo help me, help me, I’m possessed and I’m bizarreThe numbers tell the liesAnd I’m in my, driving my old carDriving my old carWe talked long behind the Texaco todayShe said she wished, yeah, but that she couldn’t stayAnd it’s not right,And it’s not wrongNo it’s somewhere in betweenThe times of yesterday and tomorrowWill she be gone?My valentineMy lovely valentine, will you be gone?Singing my old songsDriving my old carMy own valentineWe talked long behind the Texaco todayShe took us driving down the road for a waysAnd it was fineMy valentineYou’re in my mindLet’s walk out underneath the treetops
