I'm the sixth queenI'm the wrong queenI've got mascara running through my bloodstreamI'm on the hot stepI've got a broken heartI want to be a cherry lipped little cheap tartThere's a boy with a monobrow and club footAnd his family own all his villages hutsSo I'll travelled to New YorkAnd sold my crotch for a dollar and a shortBut there's a symphony in my heartAnd I've lost all my moralsDown an alleyway, boot polish, sky gazeBloody murder, my life has moved in strangewaysI was the sixth queen from the startBut I cast all my moralsOn a tube train, boot polish, sky gazeBloody murder my life has moved in strangewaysI've got secrets trapped in my fishnetsI'm a coward man that works in an office blockI was a child who craved for a new worldI was a boy who yearned to be a cover girlI learnt the history, and read about the six queensI decided life should be about playing for the other teamI broke society wit a lipstick shotNow my life has grown for old to hotBut there's a symphony in my heartAnd I've lost all my moralsDown an alleyway, boot polish, sky gazeBloody murder, my life has moved in strangewaysI was the sixth queen from the startBut I cast all my moralsOn a tube train, boot polish, sky gazeBloody murder my life has moved in strangewaysBut theres a tragedy in my heartBut I've lost all my moralsDown an alleyway, boot polish, sky gazeBloody murder, my life has moved in strangewaysI was the sixth queen from the startBut I cast all my moralsOn a tube train, boot polish, sky gazeBloody murder my life has moved in strangeways
