On scorched earth return me to be a simple manI am destined by the gods to walk this landAn embittered poet, a slave to this black bladeOh, my heart still searches for truth, a lost ageI have loved, I have lostI have killed those who have loved me soI have loved, at what costLord, I don't knowI'm living on borrowed timeI'm living on borrowed timeThese robes, purple royal, claim me their ownFrom a city lost in dust, I stand aloneEvil thoughts; evil minds; must I live like I do?Without fear, on borrowed time she helps me throughI have loved, I have lostI have killed those who have loved me soI have loved, at what costLord, I don't knowI'm living on borrowed timeI'm living on borrowed timeOn scorched earth return me to be a simple manI am destined by the gods to walk this landTo search for love, to search for loveAll in my heart, is this enough love...As Satan's child, I stand alone in handI'm a nomad of this desert, barren landsMy time is short, wild gods of air and seaStand by your corruption, and thrive by sorceryI have loved, I have lostI have killed those who have loved me soI have loved, at what costLord, I don't knowI'm living on borrowed timeI'm living on borrowed timeI'm living on borrowed timeI'm living on borrowed time
