Across the eerie watersMisty covered glass I spiedA sad procession snaking downThe dry and deathly trailAnd as my telescopic eyeFocused on the marching lineIt settled on the fallen crownNow covered with a veilThe heavy weight of mourningDrew each head to face the groundMuscles tight on bearers armsEach body cold and frailAnd through the muslin mistThe beating drums the only soundTwenty boats out in the bayAll ready to set sailAshes, take me back to earthWater, quench my human thirstAshes, take me back to earthWater, quench my human thirstMy bones soaked in the icy coldAnd fixed me where I layUntil each vessel left the shoreAnd made a line for meThere never was a breezeThe leaves were silent all that dayThey say the sails were ghostsThat stole the wind to set them freeI lay transfixedFelt nothing but the beating of my fearAs flames rose up and swallowed wholeGreatest of the fleetThe others circled roundAnd I heard chanting fill the airThe ashes lifted highWere falling back into the seaAshes, take me back to earthWater, quench my human thirstAshes, take me back to earthWater, quench my human thirst
