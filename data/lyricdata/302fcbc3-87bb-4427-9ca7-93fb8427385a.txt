It's like a makeover when the filming's overAnd she doesn't knowHow to fix it so that it'll stayAnd she can't figure outHow to tease out her hair that way herselfAnd when she wakes up all the make-upHas rubbed awayAnd she doesn't know how to find her faceIt was only for one single dayThat you looked so beautiful, babyNow your cheeks have gone paleAnd your roots dark grayAnd though they nod as they notice you're niceBaby, nobody's noticing twiceDim the lights as your memory of paradise fadesI'm like an architect who cashed his checkBut he doesn't let onThat it's the last one he'll getThough he knows the funds have run dryHe wants to have fun for one final nightStaring out at a skyline that he'll never changeThey're saying, "Though we like all things that you've madeNotice no one remembers your nameAs you float through timeFeel your powers decline day by dayYou're like a convert who goes back to workWhen he can't retrieve how the clarity actually feltWhen his co-workers ask him the words won't come outAnd in three weeks his new leaf has blown awayAnd it feels just like an average dayFacing walls talking into the phoneSitting dumbly in church all alone Picking back up the magazines he'd thrown awayWell, convert, what your god whispered into youl earYou forgot once that god disappearedAnd that life-changing dayWell, you just felt it fadeBut, of course you know, it's got to fadeYou know it's got to fadeOh you know, it's got to fade"And, falling down on the couch, he says"It's perfectly that way"
