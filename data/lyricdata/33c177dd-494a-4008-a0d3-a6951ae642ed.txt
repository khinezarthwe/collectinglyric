What we see it makes no sensewhy do we constantly believe?We have crumbled but within our bordersand I'm afraid help is out of reachThey've taken our voices and they've locked them outwith paper chains I'd like to burnI cannot even enjoy a sunsetwhen our world is on the vergeAll this weight has got my head hung lowa certain pride that gives the airI don't wanna be another discipleas they sit in their liars chairInformation has been bottled upin the news I never heardI cannot even sleep under the shining starswhen our world is on the verge(Solo)So I sit and watch this world go byjust like a lonesome birdI cannot even concentrate on my own thoughtswhen our world is on the vergewhen our world is on the verge
