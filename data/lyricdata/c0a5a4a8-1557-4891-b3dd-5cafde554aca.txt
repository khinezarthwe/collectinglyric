I heard a loud knock upon my doorA sweet stranger she entered inThe night was dark, the wind it roaredBeauty she did bringGreed and goldGreed and goldForever the loneliest roadWelcome fine lady, won't you stay this night?For fortunes may unfoldI see precious jewels you keep so tightLike a sweet child out from the coldGreed and goldGreed and goldForever the loneliest roadA silent room in the dead of nightTwo lovers lay there entwinedFrom a deep sleep to her bed I creepGreat treasures there I findThe midnight moon all across her faceIt steals her out from a dreamThe mirror smashed, sharp silver flashedBroken beauty she did scream, crying:Greed and goldGreed and goldForever the loneliest roadGreed and goldGreed and goldForever the loneliest roadEarly in the morn you will find me goneI'll seek a dark distant shoreI'll walk in fear but always hearHer knocking at my front doorShe's crying:Greed and goldGreed and goldForever the loneliest roadGreed and goldGreed and goldForever the loneliest road
