We were last kissing on a violet shoreDreaming in the color of the dress you woreI wake up haunted, wanting more about youI don't wanna… feel loveI don't wanna… feel nakedI don't wanna… feel love, without youWhen the dawn breaksI can feel the heat of your sun risingRising up inside meI can feel the waves of your heart rushingRushing over meRushing over meRushing over meRushing over meThe city stops movingAnd the subway diesThe clocks stop ticking and the traffic signsI can't keep living these strange goodbyesI need you (I need you)I don't wanna… feel loveI don't wanna… feel nakedI don't wanna… feel loveWithout youWhen the dawn breaksI can feel the heat of your sun risingRising up inside meI can feel the waves of your heart rushingRushing over meRushing over meRushing over meRushing over meI don't wanna… feel loveI don't wanna… feel nakedI don't wanna… feel loveWithout youWhen the dawn breaksI can feel the heat of your sun risingRising up inside meI can feel the crash of your heart breakingOh when the dawn breaksI can feel the heat of your sun risingRising up inside meI can feel the waves of your heart rushingRushing over me
