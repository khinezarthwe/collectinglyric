I've watched him walk away (watched him walk away)to climb the endless shadow side.I've watched him holding on (watched him holding on, watched him walk away).It was a thousand years, a thousand miles,a thousand dreams, a thousand endings with no goodbyes.He disappeared from me (a thousand miles, a thousand dreams, a thousand minutes, hold on!)as he climbed the highest peak of the dark mountain.Let the mountain sleep in the past with all our bad dreams.Was it a metaphorfor all the subtle ways that we'd grow apart?Was it mortalityclimbing him blind right off the edge of his life?Into the hands of a loving god,or the raging void where we get torn apart?With his hands in the air,was he laughing and dancingor only just trying to wave goodbye?Did he say a prayer for me (Hold on!)as he climbed the highest peak of the dark mountain?Let the mountain fall.Strike me down until I canâ€™t go on.Right now, let me fall downunder the ground.Do we go on alone?It felt like a thousand yearsIt was a thousand miles away.It was a thousand miles away.
