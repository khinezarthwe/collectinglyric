I want to be overcomeBut I can't, I am numbI want to see what's becomeClose my eyes, bite my tongueIf you'll believe in me I'll try not to dieIf work keeps me living its got to start giving me lifeNot just strifeI'm so tired of living hereI'm so tired of giving here(x2)I want to run and be freeBut I can't, I'm so weak (yeah)I want to hold you againIn my arms, my old friendI have just one more chance to feelWhat is realI can't keep on going I feel my mind slowingMy heart's torn apartI'm so tired of living hereI'm so tired of giving here(x2)
