When you see the spiral turning through aloneAnd you feel so heavy that you just can't stop itWhen this sea of madness turns you into stonePicture of your life shoots like a rocketAll the timePut 'me' in the equation it's alrightI've seen you moving in and out of sightMy friends tell me it's all cut through youFrom nowhere, to nowhereCut together, cutting throughI'm island-bound, a mote inside my eyeI can't see you breathing as beforeI am airless, a vacuum childI can't stand to reason at your doorIn this timePut 'me' in the equation it's alrightI've seen you moving in and out of sightMy friends tell me it's all cut through yoFrom nowhere, to nowhereCome togetherI'm down in the daytime out of sightComin' in from dreamland I'm on fireI can see it's all been here beforeDream a dream that lies right at your doorWhen the seasons circle sideways out of turnAnd words don't speak just fall across the carpetYou're just in time to watch the fires burnIt seems a crime but yr. face is bright you love itAll the time
