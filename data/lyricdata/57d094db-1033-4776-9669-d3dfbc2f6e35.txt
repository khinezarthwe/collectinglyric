There's a feast, well prepared, at the table,And a beast, licking holes, in your door,Make a break just as soon as your able,To run, get out of this hole, before it takes your soulI don't know how to hide,Keep my shadow alive,It's easy to defend,The logic of a friendAnd i don't know how to tell, is it heaven or hellThat i'll be going toJust as long as i'm there with you.Theres a clockTicking slow, on the tableAs the light, finds the cracks in your doorMake a break just as soon as your ableTo run, hold on to your soul, before it take you wholeI don't know how to hide,Keep my shadow alive,It's easy to defend,The logic of a friendAnd i don't know how to tell, if it's heaven or hellThat i'll be going toJust as long as i'm there with you.
