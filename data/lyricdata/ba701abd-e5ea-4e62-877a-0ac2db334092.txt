Sometimes we cry like dolls in a cageSometimes we smile like heroes in spaceHow many times they get to youLike iron butterflies...And disappear 'cause you wanna be someone elseAnd try to change to be the king of your lifeThere is not a hell for the drugsThere is not a heavenFor the only ones that are still prayin'But nowI've found a deep and sweet bomb in my heartCome to meWe'll disappear in a world without liesAnd nowI've found a deep and sweet bomb in my heartCome to meWe'll disappear in our worldHow many times they get to youLike iron butterflies...And disappear 'cause you wanna be someone elseAnd try to change to be the king of your lifeThere is not a hell for the drugsThere is not a heavenFor the only ones that are still prayin'('Cause they think they could be saved)But nowI've found a deep and sweet bomb in my heartCome to meWe'll disappear in a world without liesAnd nowI've found a deep and sweet bomb in my heartCome to meWe'll disappear in our worldThey get inside like iron butterfliesIn my heart...In my heart...a deep bomb...
