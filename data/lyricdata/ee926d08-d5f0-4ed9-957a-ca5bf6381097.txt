Losing a whole yearLosing a whole yearI remember you and me used to spendThe whole goddamned day in bedLosing a whole yearHiding in your room we'd lay like dogsAnd the phone would ring like a joke that's left unsaidLosing a whole yearRich daddy left you with a parachuteYour voice sounds like money and your face is cuteBut your daddy left you with no loveYou touch everything with the velvet glove andNow you want to try a life of sinYou want to be down with the down and inAlways copping my truthsI kind of get the feeling like I'm being usedAnd now I realize that you never heardOne goddamned word I ever saidLosing a whole yearLosing a whole yearI took your stuff and put it in the basementWhen I found out what the smile on your face meantI've seen you pop that check, babeCraning your neck at the car wreckAnd it always seemed the juice used to flowIn the car, in the kitchen, you were good to goNow we're stuck with the tubeA sink full of dishes and some aqua lubeAnd I remember you and me used to spendThe whole goddamned day in bedLosing a whole yearHey, why...Losing a whole yearIf it's not the defense then you're on the attackWhen you start talking I hear the ProzacConvinced you've found your placeWith the pierced queer teens in cyberspaceWhen you were yourself there it tasted sweetSours into a routine deceitWell this drama is a boreAnd I don't want to play no moreWhy, whyWhy, whyLosing a whole yearI remember you and me used to spendThe whole goddamned day in bedHey, whyHey, why
