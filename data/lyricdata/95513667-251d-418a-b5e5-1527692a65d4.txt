I hang my head down on Hollywood'Cause either way you look down it's just starsAnd I'm making my way down the CherokeeTo get drunk in a barAnd I know my friends, they worry about meI can see it written on their faceDespite anything that I said beforeThe bar is a beautiful place. . . . sha na na na, sha la la la la.I got a cold in my heart that the doctor can't feelHe said "go get you a beer"But they don't let the sunshine come in here.Sha la. Sha la la laWhere the hookers and thieves and the junkies playIt's a circus round here for sureAnd I worry about how I'm fitting inIf I only had herAnd I know my friends they worry about meI can see it written on their faceBut despite anything I might have said before,The bar is a beautiful place. . . . sha na na na, sha la la la la.Ain't it strange, I see your face in the window of a storeHolding me back from throwing my bottles out at the carsSha la. Sha la la laSo hey there, Mrs. SamuelsHey Laura, I'm thinking of youWould you take an old drunk as-isIf he was sweet to youAnd tomorrow, you'll probably give up on meI won't blame you, hell I'll celebrate'Cause despite anything you may have said to me
