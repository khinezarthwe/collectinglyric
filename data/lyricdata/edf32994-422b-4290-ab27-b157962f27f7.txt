I smile, you laugh, I look awayI sigh, you ask me why, I say,It's ok and I am just feeling' downYour hand on mine I hear the wordsIf only love had found us first,Our lives they would be different, ohSo I stand and wait, I am just a man, ohWhere would we be now baby,If we found each other first,Where would we be now baby,And now I must confess, that I am a sinking shipAnd I'm anchored by the weight of my heartCause its filled with these feelingsBut I keep my true thought locked, beside my hearts black boxAnd it wont be found, it won't survive through the smoke or the wreckageSo I crash and burn, I got a lot of things to learn, ohWhere would we be now baby,If we found each other firstWhat would you do now darling,If I said these simple wordsI'll wait, I'll waitAs long as you wantBut where would we be now babyI'll wait, I'll waitWhere would we be now baby,If we found each other firstWhat would you do now darling,If I said these simple wordsI'll wait, I'll waitAs long as you wantBut where would we be now babyI'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait
