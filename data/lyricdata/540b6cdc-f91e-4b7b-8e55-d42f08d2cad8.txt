Close your eyes, and I will be swimmingLullabies fill your room, and I will be singingSinging to only youDon't forget I'll hold your handWatch the night sky fading redBut as you sleep, and no one is listeningI will lift you off your feet, I'll keep you from sinkingDon't you wake up yet, cause soon I'll be leaving youSoon I'll be leaving you, but you won't be leaving meIn the car, the radio leaves me searching for your starA constellation of frustration driving hardSinging my thoughts back to me, and watching heartache on TVBut as you sleep, and no one is listeningI will lift you off your feet, I'll keep you from sinkingDon't you wake up yet, cause soon I'll be leaving youSoon I'll be leaving you, but you won't be leaving meDon't forget I'll hold your hand, watch the night sky fading redBut as you sleep, and no one is listeningI will lift you off your feet, I'll keep you from sinkingDon't you wake up yet, cause soon I'll be leaving youSoon I'll be leaving you, but you won't be leaving me
