In the white roomWith black curtainsNear the stationsBlackroof countryNo gold pavementsTired starlingsSilver horsesRan down moonbeamsIn your dark eyesDawn-light smilesOn you leavingMy contentmentI'll wait in this placeWhere the sun never shinesWait in this placeWhere the shadows run from themselvesYou said no stringsCould secure youAt the stationPlatform ticketsRestless dieselsGoodbye windowsI walked intoSuch a sad timeAt the stationAs I walked outFelt my own needJust beginningI'll wait in the queueWhen the trains come backLie with youWhere the shadows run from themselvesAt the partyShe was kindnessIn the hard crowdConsolationFor the old woundsNow forgottenYellow tigersCrouched in junglesIn her dark eyesShe's just dressingGoodbye windowsTired starlingsI'll sleep in this placeWith the lonely crowdLife in the darkWhere the shadows run from themselves
