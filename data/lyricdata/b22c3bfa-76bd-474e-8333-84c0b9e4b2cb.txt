So love me gently with a chainsaw, (Chainsaw)and take the glass against your wrists.You know I am your worst nightmareOh how you love my bloody kiss.But its time to die(Your worth more dead)Tell me your fantasiesI'll make you believeThat I really careI'll look into your eyes,I'll tell you all my lies.As I take you slow.So love me gently with a chainsaw (Chainsaw)I'll leave you like your father did.I'll bite your lip, so fucking, so hard.And watch the innocence just rip.Rip down your chest, and into mine.Tell me your fantasiesI'll make you believeThat I really careI'll look into your eyes,I'll tell you all my lies.As I take you slow.So take your tears and go awaySo take your tears and go awayA bitter ending from a slow decay.So take your tears and go away.And I'll sit here with a smile and a match.The pain, she cried, the heartache.The lies, she cried, the heartache.The life, she cried, the heartacheAnd your life, she cried.And the heartache.
