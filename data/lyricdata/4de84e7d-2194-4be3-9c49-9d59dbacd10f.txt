(No we can't)See the ruins of the old world belowThat's what our ancestors left us.Our robot masters will knowHow to clean this mess upAnd build a better worldFor man and machine alikeFor the boys and the girlsWho are slaves building spaceships at nightIn the fluorescent light.That's 2009.(No we can't, No we won't, No we can't, No we won't)On cold frosty Martian morningsThe chill on my breath is redRedder than my mother's bloodWhen she turned to me and said"This is not how we planned itBut we've gotten ahead of ourselvesComputers rule the planetAnd the moon and mars as wellWe lost the fight"That's 2009.I have a microchipImplanted in my heartSo if I try to escapeThe robots will blow me apartAnd my limbs will go flyingAnd land before the ones that I loveWho would wail and would weepBut the robots would keep them at bayWhile I shut my eyesFor the very last time.Citizens of tomorrow be forewarned.
