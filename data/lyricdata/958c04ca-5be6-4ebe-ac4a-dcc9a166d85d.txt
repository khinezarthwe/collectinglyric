To start out you were fineAlways holding my handAlways trying to understand and shareNow I'm no longer newIt's take me or leave meLike you don't want or need me, or careBut, baby, why should I settle for you?Now it's fight after fightNothing I do seems rightI stay in every night with youBut you're better than noneAnd you're no worse than someSo I guess the deal's done, it's trueBut baby why should I settle for you?And each time that I leaveI think I'll feel some reliefBut it's never the way I doI check out other guys but toMy surpriseNo one catches my eye but youBut baby why should I settle for you?
