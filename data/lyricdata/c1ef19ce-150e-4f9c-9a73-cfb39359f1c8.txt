Now I'm sitting on a plane, lonely flight back to LADon't come back with meSo I'll drink myself to sleep, cut my skin until I bleedHold my breath all the nightCause it's 5 o'clock, the hour stops the sunlightAnd the buildings shade the masquerade and kill timeHear the sound, she was naked on the groundTill I whispered in her earCome away, watch the dawn break through the dayTill the sun is underneathCause it's 5 o'clock, the hour stops the sunlightAnd the buildings shade the masquerade and kill timeHere we're nothing more than fools and whores and sad highsThrough the summer sand, we're living in a wastelandIt's a wasteland...It's a wasteland...It's a wasteland...For me...We're nothing more than fools and whores and sad highsThrough the summer sand, we're living in a wastelandWe're nothing more than fools and whores and sad highsThrough the summer sand, we're living in a wastelandIt's a wasteland...It's a wasteland...It's a wasteland...For me...For me...
