I'm in a lonely roomHank Williams sings a lovesick bluesWinter's walking up the avenueAnd I ain't seen the sun shine since the 6th of JuneBut I tell you thisDon't call the doctorI'm gonna get betterDon't run for the priestI'm gonna find some faithJust because I burned my bible babyIt don't mean I'm too sick to prayI'm in a crowded placeBut I can't recognize a single faceThey say the thrill is in the chaseWell I ain't got the legs, I ain't got the legs to run that raceBut I tell you thisDon't call the doctorI'm gonna get betterDon't run for the priestI'm gonna find some faithJust because I burned my bible babyIt don't mean I'm too sick to prayBetter burn a candle brightRaise up some ghosts tonightThey say I made my money messing up young mindsI stooped the congregation and left them all cryingIn the rain, yeah, left them with their painExit your boy with his ill-gotten gainsWell the blood runs deep and the blood runs coldAs the knife slits so... another sucker is bornThrown into this world aloneDoctor came knocking, wasn't nobody homeEase the painDon't call the doctorI'm gonna get betterDon't run for the priestI'm gonna find some faithJust because I burned my bible babyIt don't mean I'm too sick to prayDon't call the doctorI'm gonna get betterDon't run for the priestI'm gonna find some faithJust because I burned my bible babyIt don't meanIt don't meanI'm too sick to prayI'm too sick to pray
