I know when something's just not right,I know the way you lie to me,I've seen it beforethe way you let them get to you,change your ways and points of view,you're nothing but a foolIt's the last thing you needYou think they'll wait around for you,You think they're just the same as you,You mean nothing to themWants and needs are different beasts,They'll suck you dry until you bleed,Bleed from all sidesIt's the last thing you needIt's the last thing you need in your lifeOnly time lets you seethe way you change so easilyYou don't need no one elseJust believe in yourself
