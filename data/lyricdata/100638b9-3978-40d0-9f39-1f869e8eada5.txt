If I said that we could flyAround the world two thousand timesIf i said that baby your smileHad taken me by surpriseIf I had changed my mind, would I be hereYou groan to passing guestsYour car has run out of gasIf i said you're working to hardWould you be there in my mindIf I had changed my mind, would I be hereWould I be, could I be, here, come onIf I had changed my mind, would I be hereWould I be here
