(C. Murphy/Sloan)All the resumes were splendidBut she's the one they recommendedFor the job but starting late in lifeMeans she can't celebrateShe hasn't time or energyTo spend on friends and familyShe's got some catching up to doAnd precious hours are fewOh the life of a working girlI used to see her all the timeShe's young at heart but no teenagerEarly thirties I would wagerI came along a little laterSo I could merely carbon date herAge, she's not keen toIt's a trap, I a doorIn the stage she can go throughUntil the encoreNow she's the one who gives belatedBirthday wishes devastatedShe forgot it on the dayBut this is not a job that pays herBy the hour or she'd be setBefore the sun so she forgetsThese things like light upon her faceWho'll spring her from this placeOh the life of a working girlI used to see her all the timeOh the life of a working girlI used to see her all the timeNow someone's had a few successesWho, I'll give you twenty guessesTake some credit just admit itEverybody knows you did itIt's not that I'm not happy for herBut it's not easy to adore herFrom afar does she get lonelyLike I do if I could only see her all the timeSee her all the timeOh the life of a working girlI used to see her all the timeOh the life of a working girlI used to see her all the time
