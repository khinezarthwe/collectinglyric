by Paul WellerDreams Schemes and everythingsFill the dusty corners of your mind -As cars, boats and aeroplanesJust remind you of a better timeAs love's hopes and everyone'sAnyone worth a minute of your time -When unhampered by the agents,Of the governors of the faceless so opaque,As bare tree's and winter windsJust confine you to - a bitter placeA time you can't face-A peace of your mindWe should be playing in the sunshineHappy to be part of everything,Not handled, greedy handlersBrought down and destroyedBy their own ways-Liars! Liars! - smoking on pipes.dimwit firesWho Just throw it in their way-And how's your father todayWas he caught in the rainÂ ?Waiting on a BedPutting up with the painyour three wishes expirenow your back in the firelock the genie in the shedput a pistol to his headNot handcuffed to some wankerWho doesn't know me(and  doesn't see (that) our lives are made-(on) from all the efforts,of the masses,And all the people who deserve a better - fateThan a time you can't traceNo peace in your mindA time you can't placeNow your back in the race-Your three wishes expiredNow your back in the fire(your three wishes expired -Now your back in the fire)See you just can't playnow without a sayAlways got to be the manAlways got to have the plan-It doesn't run that wayInto the ether you'll say(your three wishes expired -Now your back in the fire)your three wishes expired -Now your back in the fire
