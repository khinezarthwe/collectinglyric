The beautiful lullThe dangerous tugWe get to feel smallFrom high up aboveAnd after a glimpseOver the topThe rest of the worldBecomes a gift shopThe pendulum swingsFor the horse like a manOut over the rimIs ice cream to himThe beautiful lullThe dangerous tugWe get to feel smallBut not out of place at allWe're forced to bedBut we're free to dreamAll us humans extrasAll us hearded beingsAnd after a glimpseOver the topThe rest of the worldBecomes a gift shopI don't know what to believeSometimes I even forgetAnd if it's a lieTerrorists made me say itThe beautiful lullThe dangerous tugWe get to feel smallFrom high up aboveFrom high up aboveFrom high up aboveFrom high up aboveFrom high up above
