Staying up late almost every night,Talking to you on the phoneLow in the dark in the coldAnd every moment gets shorter and shorterAnd everyone feels on their ownLet's go swim out in the moon's glowSleep in an igloo with youLook at the stars and the moonMy pace is glacialBut I'll take you to allThe places you've wanted to goI should've knownToo good too be trueBut for what it's worthIt won't stop untilIt's through with you, you, you, you, ooh ooh.Let's take a breakFrom the cold wind todayWalk up and down in the mallTrees aging red in the fallAnd all of the animals stare at you coldlyThey think you look tasty to eat.Let's goLook at the ocean againWater feels cold on my handsLeave all our things on the sandAnd I've got a feelingThat soon you'll be leavingDon't know if you'll be back again.I should've knownIt's too good to be trueFor what it's worthIt won't stop until it's through with you,You, you, you, you, ooh ooh.Most of the timeYou don't know what to doYou just walk in a straight lineAct like there's plenty of timeYou sweet talk yourself into going along with the plan that has already failedThere's not anything now left to doMany shouldn't have diedYou just got lucky and dumbAnd every life brings you closer and closerAnd everyone beats you in the end.
