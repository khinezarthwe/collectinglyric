Six lanes, tail lightsRed ants marching into the nightDisappear to the left and right againAnother supper from a sackA 99-cent heart attackI've got a pounding head and an achin backAnd the camels buried in the big straw stackI'm gonna live where the green grass growsWatch my corn pop up in rowsEvery night be tucked in close to youRaise our kids where the good Lord's blessedPoint our rocking chairs towards the WestAnd plant our dreams where the peaceful river flowsWhere the green grass growsWell I'm from a map dotA stop sign on a black topCaught the first bus I could hop from thereBut all of this glitter is getting darkThere's concrete growin in the city parkI don't know who my neighbors areThere's bars on the corners and bars on my heartI'm gonna live where the green grass growsWatch my corn pop up in rowsEvery night be tucked in close to youRaise our kids where the good Lord's blessedPoint our rocking chairs towards the westPlant our dreams where the peaceful river flowsWhere the green grass growsI'm gonna live where the green grass growsWatch my corn pop up in rowsEvery night be tucked in close to youRaise our kids where the good Lord's blessedPoint our rocking chairs towards the westPlant our dreams where the peaceful river flowsOh, where the green grass grows
