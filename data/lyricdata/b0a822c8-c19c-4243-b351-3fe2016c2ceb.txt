Transmission radio, radio...respond if your alive.Give me a sign of life.I need to say to you...I've found a way to fight.One hope for all mankind.We're gonna take control.Dancing is your weapon.Let the moves unfold.Kill 'em with your steppin'We can win this war.Its time to come togetherNow we're stronger then we were before.They're trying to take our lives.But we will survive.We're running out of time,the world ends tonight.Unless we dance or die. Dance or die.Transmission radio, radio...take back the night.Dance for your right.I am on my way to you, way to you...we can reunite.And watch the sky ignite.They couldn't take the sound.They fall harder when they're bigger.Yea they all crashed down.Our party pulled the trigger.We won this war.Because we came together.Made wish they were never born.They try to take your lives.You will survive.Look into my eyes.Don't say goodbye.You got to dance or die.Dance or die.One-two-three-four.I declare a dance war.Dance or die.Five-six-seven-eight.Now its time to celebrate.Dance or Die.
