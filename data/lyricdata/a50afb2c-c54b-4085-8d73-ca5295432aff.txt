Close your eyes and imagineThe soldier, at Valley ForgeThe suffering that he endured was realStarvation, total warYet in his eyes, the iron will to winAnd for the cause he won't relentChorus:Would he look upon us now in anger and disgust?His providence, our birthright and our creedWill we let ignorance and laziness bring our demise?Complacency, we're blinded by our greedStanding barefoot, frozen bloody handsHis musket clutched in iron gripBut for the cause he has but one regretHe's only got one life to giveChorusIt's time for us to open up our eyesAnd cherish the lives we all can haveAnd to the ones who kept our freedom freeWords can't express all that you've doneChorus
