I don't wanna sayIf it goes awayAnd I don't wanna tryYou don't have to lieAnd I don't think I saidWhat I should have saidI never caught you outThough I had my doubtsWaitWhen there's nothing left to wasteOn a promise I can makeYou don't want no one this wayWaitAnd I don't see insideWhere you try to hideAnd I don't wanna doWhat you asked me toWaitWhen there's nothing left to wasteOn a promise I can makeYou don't want no one this wayWaitWe see each other from the corners of the roomI think that when this mess is overNever make a moveWhen all I see is broken down to every sizeI will remember how I got hereLove in every eyeI don't remember if the rest are ever good enoughAnd I don't remember if the rest will ever mean as muchAnd I don't wanna sayIf it goes awayAnd I don't wanna tryYou don't have to lie
