So this is permanence, love's shattered prideWhat once was innocence, turned on its sideA cloud hangs over me, marks every moveDeep in the memory of what once was loveOh, how I realised how I wanted timePut into perspective, tried so hard to findJust for one moment, thought I'd found my wayDestiny unfolded, I watched it slip awayExcessive flash points beyond all reachSolitary demands for all I'd like to keepLet's take a ride out, see what we can findA valueless collection of hopes and past desiresI never realised the lengths I'd have to goAll the darkest corners of a sense I didn't knowJust for one moment, I heard somebody callLooked beyond the day in hand, there's nothing there at allNow that I've realised how it's all gone wrongGotta find some therapy, this treatment takes too longDeep in the heart of where sympathy held swayGotta find my destiny before it gets too late
