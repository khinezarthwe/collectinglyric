Have you been headwiredWere you satisfiedDid it free the feelings in your spineSleeping way inside all this timeWill you meet your mind where the night collidesWill you greet yourself when the sun arrivesI'll just stay behind, I've met mineBetter than a bullet being firedTangled in your headwires nowBetter than a bullet being firedTangled in your headwire, headwires nowHelp you feed the wires when your head unwindsAnd if our headlines become entwinedYou can have all mine, I'll be fineThere's a reason why keeping me aliveThere's a cure in me that I wish were mineAs long as I can fight, I'll surviveBetter than a bullet being firedTangled in your headwires nowBetter than a bullet being firedTangled in your headwire, headwireStationed on the wire, one day I'll let goTell them all hello, tell them all helloStationed on the wire, one day I'll let goTell them all hello, tell them all helloHeadwireHello...The sun is on ArlandriaThe sun is on Arlandria, headwireThe sun is on ArlandriaThe sun is on Arlandria, headwireThe sun is on ArlandriaThe sun is on Arlandria, headwireHeadwire
