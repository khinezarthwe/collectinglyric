Another day, another fantasyI've been hidden for a long timeBehind a solitary doorAnd I was screaming aloneAnd I was searching for another placeTo perceive other thingsAnd to see other facesSo far, so far away...Be my lips, and you'll taste the unrealBe my eyes and you'll see the unrealBe my hands and you'll keep the unrealBe what you want...unrealThis is me, my realityMaybe you think that I am insaneAnyway, I need to be myselfAnd I don't know what you're living nowBut I know that I am far away...Away from your cityFrom your identityI am born againBe my lips, and you'll taste the unrealBe my eyes and you'll see the unrealBe my hands and you'll keep the unrealBe what you want...unrealMarking my skin like in a déjà-vuThat I cannot live withoutMercury's flowing throughIs flowing through my veins...Be my lips, and you'll taste the unrealBe my eyes and you'll see the unreal
