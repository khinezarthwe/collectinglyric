I gave up my eyes to a man who was blindand I gave all my strength to a man who was tiredI gave my desire to a man with more fireand I lost my good looks to a girl I admiredI lent out my voice to a small group of choir boysand I gave up my hands to a man who made toysand all that I kept was the heart in my chestand I hoped that someday I could give it awaybut before my chance came, you broke it in twobut if you had just asked, I would've given it to youI went to great lengths for a cause that was spentand I lost all my friends to a lack of commitmentI gave my best clothes to a man who proposedto a woman I loved, but I didn't really knowand all I have left is the heart in my chestand I'd give it to you if I thought you'd be impressedbut what would you do with a heart split in two?and a heart that won't work is of no use to youso I laid my heart down in a box in the groundand I threw on some earth, and I tried to forgetthat a heart that won't work is not even wortha glimpse of your smile or an hour of your timea heart that won't work, it's not even wortha glimpse of your smile or an hour of your time
