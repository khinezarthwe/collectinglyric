Facing forwards, sinking in thin airHelp me to learn to breath againI know I’ve lost my waySo show meThere are demons inside my headI always let them winI have to learn to suffocate themThe lost ask for a handBut I can’t stop, I never stopI’ve been losing my footing hereI’m all mixed up in thisI need some kind of changeGod make it stop, I can’t make it stopThis place is getting smallerEverything in your darkest thoughts about me might be trueI hear the words you say, I still feel nothingI put my voice out there for you to hearBut the words never made much sense to youI’ve lost my pathI’m fading fastTime is shortTime is upThis is really my planTo get out in one pieceIs this really your planTo keep me lost and on my kneesI say redemptionCan someone help me hold on
