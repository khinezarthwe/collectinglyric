I've been lonelyI've been waiting for youI'm pretending and that's all I can doThe love I'm sendingAin't making it through to your heartYou've been hiding, never letting it showAlways trying to keep it under controlYou got it down and you're wellOn the way to the topBut there's something that you forgotWhat about love?Don't you want someone to care about you?What about love?Don't let it slip awayWhat about love?I only want to share it with youYou might need it somedayI can't tell you what you're feeling insideI can't sell you what you don't want to buySomething's missing and you got toLook back on your lifeYou know something here just ain't rightWhat about love?Don't you want someone to care about you?What about love?Don't let it slip awayWhat about love?I only want to share it with youWhat about love?Don't you want someone to care about you?What about love?Don't let it slip awayWhat about love?I only want to share it with you
