I told you todayI'd listen to whatever you sayAnd dance to the songs you playI told you todayI love who you areUniverse shines from afarYou gave birth to every starI love who you areI know who I amI was helpless as they made their demandsNow I'm tearing down all of their plansI know who I amBeautiful lightMade shadows on the walls tonightTwo loever one soul insightBeautiful lightI sing for youYou sing for meI told you beforeDon't want to be alone anymoreWant to show you everything that I sawI told you beforeI cannot pretendI know beginning middle and the endThis riddle like a letter to sendI cannot pretendDimension of tearsWe suffer through these endless yearsTime and purpose disappearsDimension of tearsAll of us standOn a hill overlooking the sandEndless ocean in the palm of the handAll of us stand
