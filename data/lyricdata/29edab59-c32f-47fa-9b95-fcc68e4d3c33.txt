My, oh, my, walkin' by;Who's the apple of my eye?Why, it's my very own Clonie...Oh, if I should stroll the 'hood,Who knew I could look so goodJust talkin' on the phone to Clonie?We are pals, it's cool 'cause we're not lonely;Shallow gene pool - There's nothing to my only Clonie...Me and you, hustlin' through, holdin' on through thick and thin;Just day by day, our DNA, 'cause the Olsen twins got nothin' on us...We'll survive, side by side...Mother Nature, don't you call her phony - She's my Clonie...Was wealthy, but not healthy,Had no one to dwell with me,So look who I got born - Clonie...Far from broke, bored rich folk,We don't need no natural yolk;Our babies come full formed - Clonie...We'll be huggable, get a publicist and show them;Be the most lovable thing since fucking Eminem - Oh, my friend...Multiply, we're a franchise, like Walt Disney or Hannibal Lechter;We can tell our cancer cells are more benign than old Phil Spector...We'll survive, side by side...Should have signed with Verve instead of Sony - You're my Clonie...Oh, Clonie, how I love you.Ha! I'm the only person I ever loved!Gee, that's swell!I guess you're just my fatal attractionie - You're my Clonie...
