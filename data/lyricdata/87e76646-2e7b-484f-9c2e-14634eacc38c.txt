Now buildings are starting to fallBricks beginning to breakYour steps are leaving cracks in the sidewalksLeaving trails of empty streetsAnd I'm going blind from staring at your eyesBecause they release the fire of a thousand sunsBut I've grown so numb I can barely shed a tearEven if you cut the strings that hold my head upYou're pulling teethRipping flesh so you can lick the blood from your fingersSo break these bones taste my skinLet my death sing the end of itSo you can do no more damageSo you collect no more trophiesLet me be the lastLet no one feel how I feelThis tragedy began with meSo let it end with meFrom your hell I've become this numbI wish this pain on no oneBehind your smileBeneath your lungsI hope your darkness comesThis tragedy began with meSo let it end with meI tried to be what you wanted me to beAnd I'm sorry that I can never be perfect for youBut everytime I look in the the mirrorI see your eyes staring right back at meAnd I dont want it anymoreI hope you're fucking happy
