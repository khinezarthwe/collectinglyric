Now the party's overI'm so tiredThen I see you comingOut of nowhereMuch communicationIn a motionWithout conversationOr a notionAvalonWhen the samba takes youOut of nowhereAnd the background's fadingOut of focusYes, the picture's changingEvery momentAnd your destinationYou don't know itAvalon(Dancing, dancing)(Dancing, dancing)When you bossa novaThere's no holdingWould you have me dancingOut of nowhereAvalon
