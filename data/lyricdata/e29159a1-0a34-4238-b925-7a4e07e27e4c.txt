I'm a band in a show about a man holding hands with his wifeOn a therapist's couch, with his face to the ground after fucking around countless nightsAnd there's this one episode, close-up cameras are showing him cryingHis red head and his red eyesI'm a band in a show about a boy being buried aliveFrom his head to his toes, by a criminal, but with a sensitive soul, with a set of raccoon eyesAnd there's this scene in the show when a hustler knows he's gonna dieThe ground opens and he climbs insideAnd as he speaks his last line, a thought falls from his mind, and I pick it up right through the TVOh, ohIs there a hand to take hold of the scene?I'm a man in a dream and there, dancing in front of my eyesIs a queen formed out of flaws, with her eyes all gone odd and a rod bolted into her spineShe rises up like a yawn, grips my heart like a claw, splits apart like a jaw, like an eyeAnd she asks me with a sigh"When we're so far from right, when we're losing the fight, when we are letting the light weaken its beamOh, ohIs there a hand to take hold of the scene?"I want a smile like a glistening shardI want a kiss that's as sharp as a knifeThe day expiresAnd the dry, cracked, trembling lipsGod saw fit to put this kiss insideI lift them up to youI'd like to bear witness toA light that is fine and is filling the cryingest eyesGrace in each face that is making the wastedest, brokenest ones fairly flyLove that is innocent of that old cynical, covetous, cancerous vibeAnd a beauty that annihilates all lifeLike it's lived in these nights, holding your hatred tight like a sign that you're right or you're strongWhen your doors are shut tight, I will dream you tonight and my dream will just sweep you alongWhen all fires are fanned, when we're shucking our plans, when we're too weak to stand on our two feetOh, ohIs there a hand to take hold of the scene?
