Here it goes again,Put on that deserving toneand don't forget that this was all your fault.It's breathing down your neck,you know you've got to let this go.You're such a wreck and now it starts to show.Cause all you can't deny is held insideAnd when we go, we say goodbye,and then we run, we run away.From all we can't deny is just a lie.And when we try to just get byWe just can't get past ourselves.Cause where you are is where you'll be:always wanting everything.It's all the same that you can't ignoreCause all you want is just "to be more".It's creeping up again.(It's all been considered.)(It's a game and you're not the winner)It's a haunting memory.Cause all you can't deny is held insideAnd when we go, we say goodbyeand then we run, we run away.From all we can't deny is just a lie.And when we try to just get byWe just can't get past ourselves.Cause where you are is where you'll be:always wanting everything.It's all the same- that you can't ignoreCause all you want is just "to be more".Cause who you are is who you'll be,and that is really everything.It's all the same that you can relate.Cause what you want's not what you're getting.It's just a matter of timeIt's just a matter of timeIt's just a matter of timeIt's just a matter of timeIt's just a matter of time'Til you know you'll be somebody tonight.It's just a matter of time (where you are is where you'll be)It's just a matter of time (and that is really everything)It's just a matter of time (it's all the same that you can relate)'Til you know you'll be somebody tonight. (cause what you want's not what you're getting)It's just a matter of timeIt's just a matter of time
