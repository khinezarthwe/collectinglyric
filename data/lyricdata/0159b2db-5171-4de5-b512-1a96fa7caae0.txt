We are the syncronizersSend messages through time codeMidi clock rings in my mindMachines gave me some freedomSynthesizers gave me some wingsThey drop me through twelve bit samplersWe are electronic performersWe are electronicsWe need to use envelope filtersTo say how we feelRiding on magnetic wavesWe search new programs for your pleasureI want to patch my soul on your brainBPM controls yoour heartbeatsWe are the syncronizersWe are electronic performers
