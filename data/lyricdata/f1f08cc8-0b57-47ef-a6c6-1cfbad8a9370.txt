You were a nightmare in your youthNow you're a woman, you deserve the truthI remember that little black top you wore to trap meI remember you falling asleep and when you woke up you said you had to leaveOh, you were a nightmare back in the daysNow you're a woman, but my pain ain't gone awayI remember baring my heart like a martyr sticking his throat out for attackAnd you turning like you had no part in itOh, but you were a nightmare and you dogged me all the whileYou were a nightmare and you never even triedI remember all those kisses felt like love to meBut to you they were nothing atallthose kisses felt like love to meI don't wanna hurt youI just wanna make you feel what we could have beenAll those kisses felt like love to meI don't wanna hurt youI just wanna make you feel what we could have beenAll those kisses felt like love to meI don't wanna hurt youI just wanna make you feel what we could have been
