Just give me a second, darling, to clear my headJust put down those scissors, baby, on this single bedThe sand in the hour glass is running lowI came through thunder, the cold wind, the rain, and the snowTo find you awake by your windowsillA sight for sore eyes and a view to killI broke down in horror at you standing thereThe glow from the moon shone through cracks in your hairI shouted with passion, "I love you so much", butFeeling my skin, it was cold to the touchYou whispered, "Where are you?", I questioned your doubtBut soon realised you're talking to God nowYou've got blood on your hands and I know it's mineI just need more timeSo get off your low, let's dance like we used toBut there's a light in the distance, waiting for meI will wait for youSo get off your low, let's kiss like we used toI looked in the mirror but something was wrongI saw you behind but my reflection was goneThere was smoke in the fireplace as white as the snowA voice beckoned gently, "Now it's time to go"A requiem played as you begged for forgiveness"Don't touch me", I screamed, "I've got unfinished business"You got blood on your hands and I know it's mineI just need more timeSo get off your low, let's dance like we used toBut there's a light in the distance, waiting for meI will wait for youSo get off your low, let's kiss like we used toYou got blood on your hands and I know it's mineI just need more timeSo get off your low, let's dance like we used toBut there's a light in the distance, waiting for meI will wait for youSo get off your low, let's kiss like we used to
