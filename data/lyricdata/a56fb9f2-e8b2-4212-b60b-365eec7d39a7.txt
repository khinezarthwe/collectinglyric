I can feel, there is a storm coming from the seaBring me where there's no one in betweenFound a way to be out of sightI Found a spaceship made of iceFound a Captain yelling goodbyeSaw three ships come sailing byI Found a pair of shoes glued on the floorI Found a suitcase with a throneI saw the king looking for the queen, she was lost somewhere at seaI can feel there is a thunder hanging above meAnd I don't need a secret map to find you...to find you...to find you...I Found a way to be out of sightI Found a spaceship made of iceI Found a Captain yelling goodbyeI Saw three ships come sailing byI Found a pair of shoes glued on theI Found a suitcase with a throneI saw the king looking for the queen, she was lost somewhere at seaFound a way to be out of sightFound a spaceship made of iceI Found a Captain yelling goodbyeI Saw three ships come sailing byFound a pair of shoes glued on the floorI Found a suitcase with a throneI saw the king looking for the queen, she was lost somewhere at sea...somewhere at sea...
