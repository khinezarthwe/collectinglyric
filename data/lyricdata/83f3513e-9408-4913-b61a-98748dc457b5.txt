All eyes must be on you.It's a pity you're addicted too.Now go ahead, manipulate them.Initiating doubt, a new dynamic found.By sharing all your weightless problems.All on the outside looking in.Take this moment to see what you've begun.Display this moment to see what you've become.Defined by what you sell, those lies packaged well.But you know that we can see right through you.Attention's wearing thin so type it out again.I hope this all made you happy.Forfeit all of your integrity for a temporary high.Lay it all out for the world to see.Manufacture one more lie.
