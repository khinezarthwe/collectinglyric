It was a beautiful day, the sun beat downI had the radio on, I was drivingTrees went by, me and Del were singing'Little Runaway', I was flyin'Yeah, runnin' down a dreamIt never would come to meWorking on a mysteryGoing wherever it leadsRunnin' down a dreamI felt so good, like anything was possibleHit cruise control and rubbed my eyesThe last three days the rain was unstoppableIt was always cold, no sunshineYeah, runnin' down a dreamIt never would come to meWorking on a mysteryGoing wherever it leadsRunnin' down a dreamI rolled on, the sky grew darkI put the pedal down to make some timeThere's something good waiting down this roadI'm picking up whatever is mineI'm runnin' down a dreamIt never would come to meWorking on a mysteryGoing wherever it leadsRunnin' down a dreamYeah, I'm runnin' down a dreamIt never would come to meWorking on a mysteryGoing wherever it leadsI'm runnin' down a dream
