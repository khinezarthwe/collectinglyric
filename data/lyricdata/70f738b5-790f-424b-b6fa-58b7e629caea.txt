She makes me shudderShe makes me shakeAt night i think and i want to take her awayRainbows are on her faceVisions of tattooed chainsEgyptian rain in my worldA princess on her throneChorusÂ :Queen of the nileLove me like an earthquakeQueen of the nilePlease let me be your kingDown by the quiet seaNo tide of hatred call to meQueens last on through the timeI hope the stars say that she's mineMysterious, delirious, i wonder if she knowsMindtamer, magicmaker, fortuneteller of long agoChorusQueen of the nileI dream all over youSave me from all i fearMy pyramids they wait for you
