Why do they come when you're always raining?And why can't they make a sound?And seeing the other ones fall back downBecause you're so far from homeAnd you're wailingAnd why do they come when you're always raining?And why can't they make a sound?And seeing the other ones fall back downBecause you're so far from homeAnd you're wailingYou're so far from homeAnd you're wailingAnd watched it grow in a small dark cornerAnd why can't they make a sound?And watching the other ones fall back downAnd I've watched you go coldAnd there's no tears leftAnd why do they come when the light stops raining?And where have the colours gone?And wiping their way across and now it's all goneBecause you're so far from homeAnd you're wailing
