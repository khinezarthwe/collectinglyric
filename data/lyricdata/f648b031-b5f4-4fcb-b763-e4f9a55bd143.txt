Nineteen years gone away, the kids have grown upThese trains don't run anymoreHow the view from the window's changedOn mobile phones people talk and talkDo we all complain too much?You'd see so much more of the world today if you'd taken to sleepwalkingThe last thing that you heard must have been all change, all change, all changeTime travelling makes an antique of yourselfThe curtain's pulled wide, the unveiling of a museum pieceSmall price to pay, small price to pay for this freedom of choiceYou'd see so much more of the world today if you'd taken to sleepwalkingThe last thing that you heard must have been all change, all change, all changeOut of date, in the right place at the wrong time, stolen, taken awayOut of place, but a lucky escape, rescued at lastYou'd see so much more of the world today if you'd taken to sleepwalkingThe last thing that you heard must have been all change, all change, all change
