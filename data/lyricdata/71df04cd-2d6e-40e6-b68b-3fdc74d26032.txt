What's the point in building a house hereThe nearest light is five miles awayThe woods are still in controlWhat's the point in sending your thoughts hereTo work by night and just die hereFailing to reach a resultWhat's your chance of storming a fortressWhen all you do is distortedYou're running out of timeI'm so sorryFor all the strain the worryDon't be cross about itPlease don't ask me to stand stillI can't hate you for being just whatEverybody thinks you areI'm no worse than the restBut I'm easily impressedYou've seen my file
