This wasn't just another night alone,My mind has cornered me against the wall.Bleeding, scratching, fingernails are gone,The scars on my wall tell this song.I'm feeling like the worst is yet to come,Because the night has just begun.Please let me breathe,You're choking me,And my feelings.This is my fault,Downward I fall.My mind's slipping,My mind's slipping away...I never thought this night could come again,My mind has proven me wrong in the end.The confidence in me is wearing thin,No matter what my mind will win.Please let me breathe,You're choking me,And my feelings.This is my fault,Downward I fall.My mind's slipping,My mind's slipping away...Please let me breathe,You're choking meAnd my feelings.Please let me breathe,You're choking me,And my feelings,My feelings.This is my fault.Downward I fall,My mind's slipping,My mind's slipping away...
