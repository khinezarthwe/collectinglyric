I see your wishes on the wallAnd that's all right with meI see you run to make a callPutting up to someone freeYour life and my life they don't touch at allAnd that's no way to beWe've never seemed so farWhat's real? What's true?I ain't turning my back on youWhere're you goin'? Where've you been?Making wishes, watching dreamsIt might be simple, it might be trueI might be overwhelmed by youYou might be emptyThe way your eyes just look right throughIt's such a mess now anywayWish fulfillment every dayI don't believe youNow I can't hear a word you sayI see you shaking in the lightReading the headline newsThe others they're not quite so rightWe want them to choose youI could almost see your face tonightSinging simple rhythm'n'bluesYou'll always be a starShake it babyCome on screamJust seen your face in a magazineDon't doubt itLeaves 'em soreI can't stand it anymoreIt's my favorite shot of youYou look so pretty your eyes were trueI'm still on your sideIn spite of everything you doWe're only blood on blood on lifeNew pretty pictures every nightCome wish beside meDon't you know you know what's right
