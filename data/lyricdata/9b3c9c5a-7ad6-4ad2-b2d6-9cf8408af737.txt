A simple hug keeps you safe from the frost,We love to love when were living with the both of us.As this twin channel is the symphony.This is love it's fallen from above,Maybe I don't say it enough no,But you know you mean the world to me.Done a lot of growing up in this last year,I've lost my mind and I fear so,Will I be dead and buried?I never claimed to be no angel though,I tell you in the songs I wrote,The glass went smash that was in the past but hay.......you know you mean the world to me.I was in a bad place sent on a goose chase,Was running on the long blue mile of sweet disgrace,I'm taking this time to say sorry,This time to say sorry(Full of drunken sorry's)Wasted tears cast shadows on the years,And silhouettes of arguments are always near,A most unnecessary worry,(Unnecessary worry)The fear creates the spaces for the races we can never win.I never claimed to be no angel though,I tell you in the songs I wrote,The glass went smash that was in the past n hay.You know you mean the world to meYou know you mean the world to meYou know you mean the world to meYou know you mean the world.So I'll try,Something spontaneous,Maybe a little obscene,And hilarious,But with empathy,The most caring way I know how to say coz it's change today.Titans clashed did you have a good laugh?I was in the wrong place when the glass went smash.I never claimed to be no angel though oh oh oh,We've done this,We've done that,It's all gone off the railings shouldn't think about that!!!!!We've done this,We've done that,It's all gone off the railings shouldn't think about that!!!!!Never claimed to be an angel though,I tell you in the songs I wrote.The glass went smash that was in the past but hey!!!!!!!!!!!!We should never dim the lights
