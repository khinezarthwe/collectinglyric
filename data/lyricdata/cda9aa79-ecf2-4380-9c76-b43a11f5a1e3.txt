I love you even whenI don't even know I'm doing itDismiss it out of hand'Cause I don't even know I'm doing itBut your finger starts to wiggleAnd landscapes emergeCan you spare some change, dearWe've only got three hundred feet to goRoses are worth more dried than aliveSuch a you thing to sayHow I adore you when you reinventThe rosy clich√©Can you spare some change, dearWe've only got three hundred feet to goAnd with impossibilium for a payloadWe lift the rocketOut of the pocketNothing can stop itRoses are difficult everywhereYou must promise me you'll stayThese long stems are freakish if anythingBut we can cut them down for the vaseCan you spare some change, dearWe've only got three hundred feet to goAnd with impossibilium for a payloadWe lift the rocketOut of the pocketNothing can stop itWe can only watch it
