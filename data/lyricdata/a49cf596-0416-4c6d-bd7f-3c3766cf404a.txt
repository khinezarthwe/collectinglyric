Maybe if I lay real stillIt will go away, maybe it willMaybe this time I won't budgeMaybe I just need a little nudgeMaybe this time I won't flinchMaybe this time it might be a sinchMaybe this time I won't runMaybe I'll own up to what I've doneWhat have I done?What have I done?Maybe I'm just damaged goodsAnd, baby, you're a babe in the woodsAnd me, I'm just a little lost lambBut you love me wherever I amAnd maybe I've been caught red-handedMaking off like a lucky banditAnd this wasn't how I planned itMaybe this time I could stayAnd let myself get carried awayMaybe this time it's too lateWe could make a move or we could waitMaybe she will understandAnd not expect too much from one manMaybe she canOr maybe she can'tMaybe when I've changed my tuneI'll come out of my solitudeAnd start to live my life anewAnd spend the rest of my days pleasing youAnd on the path to righteousnessI'll swept the dustWhatever it takes to gain your trustI'll do what I mustI'll do what I must (I'll do what I must)I'll do what I must (I'll do what I must)I'll do what I mustMaybe I'm just damaged goodsAnd, baby, you're a babe in the woodsAnd me, I'm just a little lost lambBut you love me wherever I amAnd maybe I've been caught red-handedMaking off like a lucky banditAnd now I walk this planetForever in search of, the alternative to loveForever in search of, the alternative to love
