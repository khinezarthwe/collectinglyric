Wishing someone would break my legsA burden too heavy to bearI've tasted the lips of the ancientsAnd witnessed the fall of hopeHopeLike saviors to the planet we have risenTaking out anyone in our pathInfiltrate the heart of the enemyAs they suck the stream of lifeFrom the decapitation of JenovaTo the drowning of Aeris (of Aeris)Don't come even a little bit closerOr I'll show you what this ultimate weapon is capable ofInfecting our soldiersPetty experiments solely to findThe strongest breed of chaosTo further corrupt our worldFailed
