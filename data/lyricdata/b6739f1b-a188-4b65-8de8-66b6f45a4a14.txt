Haunted nights for halcyon daysCan't sleep to the scraping of his voiceNature's way struck grief in meAnd I became a ghost in sicknessWillingly guided into heresyBeneath the surface, stark emptinessAnd you'd pity my convictionWhereas I thought of myself as a leaderYou'd cling to your pleasant hopeIt is twisted fascinationWhile I'd ruin the obstacles into despairAnd I'm praising deathLost love of the heartIn a holocaust scene memoryDecrepit body wearing transparent skinInside, the smoke of failureWept for solace and submit to faithIn his shadow I'm chokingYet flourishingMasterA delusion made me strongerYet I'm draped in pale withering fleshI sacrificed more than I hadAnd left my woes beneath the mire
