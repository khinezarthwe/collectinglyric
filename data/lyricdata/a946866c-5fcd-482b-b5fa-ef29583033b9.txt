Well I got a problemAnd it just won't waitI've been getting on oneWith the man who guards your gateWhen he says you're sleepingIn your hideawayIt is what he's keeping backThat gives your game awayCome quit your crazy lowdown waysYou're walking astrayCome quit your weary worn out waysYou're walking astrayAnd I'd like to sayThat I like thisMore than I do todayYes I've got a problemLike you've never seenI've been getting botheredBy the man who locks your screenWhen he says you're hidingAnd in your room you'll stayIt is what he's holding backThat says what he can't sayCome quit your crazy lowdown waysYou're walking astrayCome quit your weary worn out waysYou're walking astrayAnd I'd like to sayThat I like thisMore than I do todayI'm just a lazy manWho has to hear the truthAnd I hear what's true from youCome quit your crazy lowdown waysYou're walking astrayCome quit your weary worn out waysYou're walking astrayAnd I'd like to sayThat I like thisMore than I do todayLa la la la la la la laLa la la la la la la la
