When the time comesThat you're no longer thereFall down to my kneesBegin my nightmareWords spill from my drunken mouthI just can't keep them all inI keep up with the racing ratsAnd do my best to winSlow down, little oneYou can't keep running awayYou mustn't go outside yetIt's not your time to playStanding at the edge of your townWith the skylight in your eyesReaching out to godsThe sun says its goodbyesIf a plane were to fall from the skyHow big a hole would it leaveIn the surface of the earthLet's pretend we never metLet's pretend we're on our ownWe live different livesUntil our cover's blownI push my hand up to the skyShade my eyes from the sunAs the dust settles around meSuddenly nightime has begunIf a plane were to fall from the skyHow big a hole would it leaveIn the surface of the earthThe surface of the earthCome on nowYou knew you were lostBut you carried on anywayOh, come on nowYou knew you had no timeBut you let the day drift awayIf a plane were to fall from the skyHow big a hole would it leaveIf a plane were to fall from the skyHow big a hole would it makeIn the surface of the earthThe surface of the earthThe surface of the earth
