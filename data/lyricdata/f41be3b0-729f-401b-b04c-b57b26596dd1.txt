High above the bordertownI can see the golden groundIf I wasn't looking downI might have lost you in the milesOcean blue and foaming whitesurround the body of my flightas I flew out of sightYou were turning in the stilesand I know what it means to youand I know what it means to meand I know how it feels to beburned by the sun, the sunI love the sunNow I'm sleeping on the sandof an unfamiliar landAnd I'm dreaming up a planto get you on the breezeAnd I'm staring at the speckOf the map laid on the deckIt's time to make a trekOn forgiving seasand I know what it means to youand I know what it means to meand I know how it feels to beburned by the sun, the sunI love the sunand I know what it means to youand I know what it means to meand I know we all want to beBurned by the sun
