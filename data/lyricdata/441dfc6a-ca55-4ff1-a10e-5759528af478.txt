Tears of Ice, falling down. My cheeksforming a lake, in it's surface,I see your face and I watch it 'til it's gone.There were times, all I did was cry out your name.Only thing I feel now is pain...Tears of Ice, frozen heart, icy drops fall to the ground.Forming stream, golden dreamthat will lead me to your door.There were times all I did was cry out your name.Only thing I feel now is pain...Baby you should see, what you did to me,Now I am crying Tears of IceBaby you should feel, like I felt in those days,Now I am crying Tears of Ice
