Sophia looked at me and she just said that,Things were so different when we first metThe strange dancing boy at the camden barfly talking to strangers in the middle of the nightAs everybody brushes up on the dancefloorAll the pretty girls are screaming out for moreAs the boy with no top on plays the guitarAll the pretty girls are screaming take off your pantsIf you go back to where we first met it will only break your heartAnd if you go back to where we first met it will only break your heartAs everybody stares at the boy on the stage i get kicked out for looking under ageHitting pots and pans as i nod my head listenin to DJs playing shit recordsIf you go back to where we first met it will only break your heartAnd if you go back to where we first met it will only break your heartIf you go back to where we first met it will only break your heartIf you go back to where we first met it will only break your heart
