Sitting in your little car, it's feels like something's pulling us apartMaybe it's just gravity, some force of nature bigger than the two of usBut if we wait and see,We could live like this forever and never really seeThat you and are not meant to be aloneFloating in the nightDon't tell me that we're not connectedDon't tell me that we're not the sameDon't say that we'll be the only ones floating all aloneIt's Not you, it's not me, not usMaybe it's the hand of god, the twist of fateThe lucky break that never comes,Sitting in your little car, feels like something's pulling us apartBut if we wait and seeWe could live like this forever and never really seeThat you and are not meant to be aloneFloating in the nightDon't tell me that we're not connectedDon't tell me that we're not the sameDon't say that we'll be the only ones floating all aloneIt's Not you, it's not me, not usBut if we wait and seeWe could live like this forever and never really seeThat you and are not meant to be alonefloating in the sky until the morning sun comes upWe don't have the timeTo wonder what connects us to each others livesI guess we'll never knowSo don't compromise, what we have now
