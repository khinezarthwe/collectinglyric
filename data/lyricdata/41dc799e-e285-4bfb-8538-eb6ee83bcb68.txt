This town is coming like a ghost townAll the clubs have been closed downThis place is coming like a ghost townBands won't play no moreToo much fighting on the dance floorDo you remember the good old daysBefore the ghost town?We danced and sangAnd the music played inna de boomtownThis town is coming like a ghost townThis place is coming like a ghost townCan't go on no moreThe people getting angryThis town is coming like a ghost townThis town is coming like a ghost townThis town is coming like a ghost townThis town is coming like a ghost town
