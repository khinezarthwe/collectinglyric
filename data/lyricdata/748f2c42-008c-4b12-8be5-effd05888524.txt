The girl who works in the record shopShe says that I am not avant garde enoughWell so whatShe only works in a record shopShe only works in a record shopAnd I don’t give a fuck what she says or she thinks about meWell we shot fake plastic ducks in the parkAnd drank cheap plastic wine out of cheap plastic glasses until it got darkAnd the only thing we had to decideWas whether and where we were going to sleep together that nightSometimes I think that I don’t know anything at all  x2And now the queen is waving to meAs I walk down the street trying to mind my own business I wishThat the queen would leave me aloneThere are so many things that are far more important to me going onAnd the girl who works in the record shopShe says that i am not avant garde enoughWell so whatShe only works in a record shopShe only works in a record shopAnd i don’t give a fuck what she says or she thinks about meAnd now i’m strapped in an aeroplaneFlying ten thousand miles over frozen mountains to see you againBut the only thing i learned from the flightWas watching the birds in the bay of San Francisco at nightSometimes I think that I don’t know anything at all  x2
