Johnny, how's the Navy? I hear you're doing well. Didn't you get trained to fly those fighter planes? They'll send you to kosovo in a week or two. Johnny, why you gonna go? Do you really know? You say no. There's a war that's going on, they say it's a brand new Vietnam. Don't you feel proud to be an American now? The same GI bill that put you through college put amillions boys in the graves. Dont you feel proud to be an American now? God bless the good ole USA.
