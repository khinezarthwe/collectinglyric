Follow me into the desertAs thirsty as you areCrack a smile and cut your mouthAnd drown in alcohol'Cause down below the truth is lyingBeneath the riverbedSo quench yourself and drink the waterThat flows below her headOh noThere she goesOut in the sunshineThe sun is mineSun is mineI shot my love todayWould you cry for me?I lost my head againWould you lie for me?Close your eyes and bow your headI need a little sympathy'Cause fear is strong and love's for everyoneWho isn't meSo kill your health and kill yourselfAnd kill everything you loveAnd if you live you can fall to piecesAnd suffer with my ghostI shot my love todayWould you cry for me?I lost my head againWould you lie for me?I left her in the sandJust a burden in my handI lost my head againWould you cry for me?So follow me into the desertAs desperate as you areWhere the moon is glued to a picture of heavenAnd all the little pigs have goneOh noThere she goesOut in the sunshineThe sun is mineSun is mineI shot my love todayWould you cry for me?I lost my head againWould you lie for me?I left her in the sandJust a burden in my handI lost my head againWould you cry for me?Yeah, would you cry for me?
