Where is the real stuff and when do you knowI got a pocket full of money and no place to goAnd I'm sure that its hard, but I was too slowI got a head full of something and nothing to showTook a casual walk to let off some steamAnd I found out that maybe were not what we seemWhy was it always the land and fear of the seaIt maybe too late but you could've just asked meI always find myself stranded with cuts on my faceIn some strange part of town where I don't know my placeBut I've never left normal, if that were the caseI could never come back if my footsteps erasedAnd the houses are all sleeping all down your blockAnd I'll probably give up just so we can talkI've got a head full of something and nothing to showFor a pocket full of money and no place to goMy brother he's walked from New Zealand to RomeI crawled to the city and I couldn't find my way homeHe might never come back from the way that he talksWhereas he always returned from causal walks
