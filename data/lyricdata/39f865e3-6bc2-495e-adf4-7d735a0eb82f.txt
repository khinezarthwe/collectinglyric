Cause you bleed all the time.The pieces of a broken heart are wasted time.And I can't forgive myself for all the things I've done.But you, you do.Bleed one more time for me.'Cause my heart is filled with loneliness.And this world is filled with loneliness.Bleed one more time for me.'Cause the struggles of this world are blistering. Blistering.Your cells run through my veins.The times you lifted a dead man. That's me again.And I can't forgive myself for all the things I've done.But you, you do.Bleed one more time for me.'Cause my heart is filled with loneliness.And this world is filled with loneliness.Bleed one more time for me.'Cause the struggles of this world are blistering.Bleed one more time for me.'Cause the struggles of this world are blistering. Blistering.
