Can't you see, my darling,That the harder I tryThe more we grow apartPlease believe meThe sweeter the kissThe colder turn your armsAnd the colder grows your heartAnd, baby, more I love youI see it in your eyesI feel it in your touchI taste it from your lipsAnd, baby, more I love youI see it in your eyesI feel it in your touchI taste it from your lipsAnd, baby, more I love youAnd tonight, my darling,The closer I getThe more you're out of loveDon't you feel it?The colder your touchThe more it turns me onAnd the faster beats my heartAnd, baby, more I love youI see it in your eyesI feel it in your touchI taste it from your lipsAnd, baby, more I love you
