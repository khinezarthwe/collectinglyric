You got your piecesAnd you got your pawnsYou got devastation handsAnd a life that leads like insanityWhat you need is you needA little something that will take the edge offJust a little a push to get you to the ledgeYou can jump it fromAnd when you're jumpingOnly you would ever know againYou live for loveBut the love's all goneSurround yourself with geniusBut the meanness is enough to kill someoneSo you learn what you learnYou drink your blessingsAnd you take your pillsYou look for something betterBut you've lost your will to save yourselfSo the hurt keeps comingOnly you would ever know who was your friendI knowWhat you needYou need someone to help you tonightOnly when you're here can I feel like thisWhen I put my arms around youOnly when you smile does it hurt like thisJust let somebody love you
