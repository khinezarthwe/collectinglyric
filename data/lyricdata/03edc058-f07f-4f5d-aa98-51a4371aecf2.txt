Tambourines are shaking but I don't hear a soundIt's my favorite song but I don't like the crowdWish I was able to see what you seeAnd turn all the words into poetrySo I close my eyesAnd focus on whatever's spinning in my mindAnd I try to find a signBut I've never learned to read between the linesI know that sometimes my eyes are too blueBut I am still counting on the stars for a clueWish I was able to see what you seeI don't want it to be all chemistrySo I close my eyesAnd focus on whatever's spinning in my mindAnd I try to find a signBut I've never learned to read between the linesTambourines are shaking but I don't hear a soundIt's my favorite song but I don't like the crowdWish I was able to see what you seeAnd turn all the words into poetrySo I close my eyesAnd focus on whatever's spinning in my mindAnd I try to find a signBut I've never learned to read between the lines
