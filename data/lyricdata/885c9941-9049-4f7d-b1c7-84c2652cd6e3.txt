In Santa Monica, in the wintertime,the lazy streets so undemandingI walk into the crowdIn Santa Monica, you get your coffee fromthe coolest places on the promenadeWhere people dress just soBeauty so unavoidable,everywhere you turn it's there.I sit and wonder what am I doing hereBut on the telephone line I am anyone,I am anything I want to be.I could be a super model or Norman MailerAnd you wouldn't know the differenceWould you?In Santa Monica,all the people gotmodern names like Jake or MandyAnd modern bodies tooIn Santa Monica,on the boulevard,you'll have to dodge those in-line skatersOr they'll knock you downI never felt so lonelyNever felt so out of placeI never wanted something more than thisBut on the telephone line I am anyone,I am anything I want to beI could be a super model or Norman MailerAnd you wouldn't know the differenceOn the telephone line I am any height,I am any age I want to beI could be a caped crusader, or space invaderAnd you wouldn't know the differenceOr would you?Or would you?(repeat chorus 1 till end)
