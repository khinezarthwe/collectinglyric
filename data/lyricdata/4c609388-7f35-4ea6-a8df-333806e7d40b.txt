I don't want to be, part of the problem.I try so hard, to get roughed up.Fists on up, its looks that easy.Looks that way to me, looks that way to you.But then theres you, telling me I can.But then theres you, screaming say something.I want the ocean right now, I want the ocean right now.I get so jealous, that I cant even work.I get so jealous, that I cant even work.There I am in the morning, I dont like what I see.There I am in the morning, I dont like what I see.I dont know how, its become such a problem.Keep you up all night if I, try to remain calm.How can they ask, why I feel so angry,do you see my problem, if I never explain it.But then theres you, asking how long,say something, its taking me so long.I want the ocean right now, I want the ocean right now.I get so jealous, that I cant even work.I get so jealous, that I cant even work.I get so jealous, that I cant even work.I get so jealous, that I cant even work.There I am in the morning, I dont like what I see.There I am in the morning, I dont like what I see.
