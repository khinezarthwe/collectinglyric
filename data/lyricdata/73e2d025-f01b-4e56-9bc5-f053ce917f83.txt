Well, I thought about the armyDad said, "Son, you're fucking high"And I thought, "Yeah, there's a first for everything"So I took my old man's adviceThree sad semestersIt was only 15 grandSpent in bed, I thought about the armyI dropped out and joined a band insteadGrew a mustache and a mulletGot a job at Chick-Fil-ACiting artistic differencesThe band broke up in MayAnd in June reformed without meAnd they got a different nameI nuked another Grandma's apple pieAnd hung my head in shame, noBeen thinking a lot todayBeen thinking a lot todayOh, think I'll write a screenplayOh, think I'll take you to L.A.Oh, think I'll get it done yesterdayAw, shitIn this time of introspectionOn the eve of my electionI say to my reflection"God, please spare me more rejection"'Cause my peers, they criticize meAnd my ex-wives all despise meTry to put it all behind meBut my redneck past is nipping at my heelsThinking a lot todayBeen thinking a lot todayBeen thinking a lot todayI thought about the army
