I go out walkin' after midnightOut in the moonlight just like we used to doI'm always walkin' after midnight searchin' for youI walk for miles along the highwayWell, that's just my way of sayin' I love youI'm always walkin' after midnight searchin' for youI stop to see a weepin' willow cryin' on his pillowMaybe he's cryin' for meAnd as the skies turn gloomy and night winds whisper to meI'm lonesome as I can beI go out walkin' after midnightOut in the moonlight just hopin' you may beSomewhere walkin' after midnight searchin' for meI stop to see a weepin' willow cryin' on his pillowMaybe he's cryin' for meAnd as the skies turn gloomy and night winds whisper to meI'm lonesome as I can beI go out walkin' after midnightOut in the moonlight just hopin' you may beSomewhere walkin' after midnight searchin' for me
