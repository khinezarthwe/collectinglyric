A week went by, and then anotherAnd not a word from youI remember when a day would be unusualI saw the spring become the summerAs the spring is wont to doAnd I began to find the boredom almost beautifulOh, I must admit I welcomed itAs a month unfolded into a fewI thought of you now and thenI glimpsed you once but you were gone againWhen the autumn turned to winterAs autumn ought to doI thought Oh! What if the sun never shoneAnd then you sprang to mind unbiddenWhen it didn’tIt might have been the music from next doorReminded me I should have missed you moreA song I’ve heard a hundred times beforeA year went by, and yet anotherAnd not a word from youI remember when a day would be unusualBut I bumped into your brotherIn the supermarket queueAnd he wondered if the feeling wasn’t mutualThen, from in the wings, a neighbour singsIt might have been the music from next doorReminded me I should have missed you moreA song I’ve heard a hundred times before
