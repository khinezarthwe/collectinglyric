Tighten your tie, boyYou're something to die forBut don't hold your breath nowYou're just killing timeTonight you can dream, boyImagine a whisperIf you can keep secretsThen I'll tell you mineRemember a promise you couldn't hold on toThough it brings me to tears nowI need you to knowLook in my eyes, boyNothing like yours nowIt seems that a lifetimeIs passing us bySo open your eyes...This is forever but it won't last longThis is a memory that fades away in neverendingIn the death of allThat's long been said and done beforeWe'll wish that we were something moreStop wasting time, boyYou're late all your life, boyThey won't have the patienceFor someone like youYour memory's fadingI'll love you foreverI'll try to rememberI'll try to hold onYou're standing alone, boyWaiting for dreams, boyWaiting for somethingTo make them come trueDon't ever leave, boyI'd miss you too much, boyI'll never forget youAs long as I'm here
