I knew that something must be upI'm not as daft as I might lookBut if you can't be good be carefulIf you don't brush your coat that hair willGive the game awayI knew you'd think of going thereOh I can lend you both the fareBut if you've got a choice then use itYou don't know what you need until you lose itI've done the same myselfI wish you knew for sureI don't understand you anymoreBefore you slam that doorThere's so much to lose and you will lose it allOh you will lose it allYou know that I'll always stand byBut don't ask me if I'll lieI don't see any guilt on your faceI wouldn't like to be in your placeYou don't know when you're well offI wish I knew for sureI don't understand you anymoreBefore you slam that doorThere's so much to lose and we will lose it allOh we will lose it all
