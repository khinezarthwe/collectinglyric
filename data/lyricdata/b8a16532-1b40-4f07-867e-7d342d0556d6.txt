Oh, what a shame that your pockets did bleed on St. Valentine'sAnd you sat in a chair thinkin' "Boy I'm such a prince"Well life's a train that goes from February on day by dayBut it's makin' a stop on April firstAnd you will believe in loveAnd all that it's supposed to beBut just until the fish start to smellAnd you're struck down by a hammerSure you were swift when the handsome Greek boys dropped by with giftsYou are suave thanks to ribbons that opened sesameBut in the stars and closer to home in every planetIt ain't hard for me and dear JoJo to seeThat you will believe in loveAnd all that it's supposed to beBut just until the fish start to smellAnd you're struck down by a hammerSo let it all go byLookin' at the skyWonderin' if there's clouds and stuff in hellLet it all go by (Looking at the sky)Lookin' at the sky (Wonderin' if there's clouds and stuff in hell)Wondering if there are clouds in hellAnd you will believe in loveAnd all that it's supposed to beYes you will believe in loveGirl you will believe in loveAnd all that it's supposed to beYes you will believe in loveBut you will believe in loveAnd all that it's supposed to beYes you will believe in loveAnd you will believe in loveAnd all that it's supposed to beYes you will believe in love
