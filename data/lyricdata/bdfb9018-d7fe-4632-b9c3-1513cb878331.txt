As soon as I get my head round youI come around catching sparks off youI get an electric charge from youThat second hand living it just won't doAnd the way I feel tonightI could die and I wouldn't mindAnd there's something going on insideMakes you want to feel makes you want to tryMakes you want to blow the stars from the skyI can't stand up I can't cool downI can't get my head off the groundAs soon as I get my head round youI come around catching sparks off youAnd all I ever got from youWas all I ever took from youAnd the world could die in painAnd I wouldn't feel no shameAnd there's nothing holding me to blameMakes you want to feel makes you want to tryMakes you want to blow the stars from the skyI'm taking myself to the dirty part of townWhere all my troubles can't be found
