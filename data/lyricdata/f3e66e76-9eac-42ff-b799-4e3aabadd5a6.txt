Loose tie-rods and a fire full of coalblowing smoke out the earsAs I head for the holewithout a ten-foot poleI don't like the feeling of beingout of controlYou knew the reason but you let it startThis vice would be your endAnd now the end has comeYou're feeling really dumbbut you deserve itYou had no choiceIt falls apart,in little pieces on the floortoo wild to keep togetherso you want it moreIt falls apart, falls apart, falls apartYou talked a bluestreak, but you never gaveGo ahead, crawl in the caveAnd now the end has comeYou're feeling really dumbbut you deserve itYou had no choiceIt falls apart,in little pieces on the floortoo wild to keep togetherso you want it moreIt falls apart, falls apart, falls apart
