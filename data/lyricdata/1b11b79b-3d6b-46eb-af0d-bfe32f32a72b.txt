Fear of tomorrow - we're waiting for the final crashThe lost illusion - there ain't no light for us to seeOur gods commandments - we once forgot and threw awayHumiliating - our lifes on earth will fade awayA hopeless challenge - we're on our kneesTime's getting nearerWe thought we were wise but we cannot survive on this earthWe challenged nature - we made it fall instead of riseOur mighty empire - is surely built on sinkin' groundA hopeless challenge - we're on our kneesTime's getting nearerWe thought we were wise but we cannot survive on this earthInnocent dreams turned to nightmarePalace of glass, turned to dustDay turned to night, don't you careLife turned to death, forever lost.
