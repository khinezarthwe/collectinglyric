If I could see into your heartThen would I know just where to start?'Cause I'm lost and I need to be foundCrazy as it sounds, I need you aroundIf I could stand to be on my ownThen I would probably just leave you aloneBut I'm gonna feel this way till I'm six feet undergroundCrazy as it sounds, I need you aroundTurning, tossing and turningMy love is burning me downIf I could change one thing in this worldI'd change your mind and make you my girl'Cause I'm lost and I need to be foundCrazy as it sounds, I need you aroundI'm gonna feel this way till I'm six feet undergroundCrazy as it sounds, I need you aroundI need you around, I need you around, I need you around
