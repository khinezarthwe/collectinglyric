My best friend gave me the best adviceHe said each day's a gift and not a given rightLeave no stone unturned, Leave your fears behindAnd try to take the path less traveled byThat first step you take is the longest strideIf today was your last dayAnd tomorrow was too lateCould you say goodbye to yesterday?Would you live each moment like your last?Leave old pictures in the pastDonate every dime you have?If today was your last day,If today was your last day.Against the grain should be a way of lifeWhat's worth the price is always worth the fightEvery second counts 'cause there's no second try,So live like you'll never live it twiceDon't take the free ride in your own lifeIf today was your last dayAnd tomorrow was too lateCould you say goodbye to yesterday?Would you live each moment like your last?Leave old pictures in the pastDonate every dime you have?Would you call old friends you never see?Reminisce old memoriesWould you forgive your enemies?Would you find that one you're dreamin' ofSwear up and down to God aboveThat you finally fall in loveIf today was your last dayIf today was your last day...Would you make your markBy mending a broken heart?You know it's never too lateTo shoot for the stars,Regardless of who you areSo do whatever it takes'cause you can't rewindA moment in this lifeLet nothin' stand in your way'cause the hands of timeAre never on your sideIf today was your last dayAnd tomorrow was too late,Could you say goodbye to yesterday?Would you live each moment like your last?Leave old pictures in the pastDonate every dime you have?Would you call old friends you never see?Reminisce old memoriesWould you forgive your enemies?Would you find that one you're dreamin' ofSwear up and down to God aboveThat you finally fall in loveIf today was your last day
