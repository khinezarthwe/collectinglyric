[Lee]Stretch me to the point where I stopRun ten thousand miles and then think of meI think you know the place we should meetDon't worry if it's dark and I'm lateRun me out a thin wireHelp me to kill this, loveI'll join you tonight at the bottom of the wellJust feel around in the dark until you get the ideaI'm not moving doesn't mean I can'tFlame on in my headMy best friend sucked his wife's blood an shriveled upHe was mistaken for saneWe move and groove and cut loose from fearWe should kill time, we'll shut it downI've got a pipeline straight to the heart of youOpening in my headBright glass on a chain being wound around usThe toiling of idle handsDripping,with guiltA secret form of punishmentAxes through skullsShadow of futilityEndlessRevoltThe shifting of light and shadowsDividing each existenceNo one is rightNothing is solidNothing can be held in my hands for longDiscontinuitySandy beachesBridges sinking into the seaBeautiful confusionYou're a fading memoryWe should kill time
