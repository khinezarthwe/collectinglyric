I still hear your voice when you sleep next to meI still feel your touch in my dreamsForgive me my weakness, but I don't know whyWithout you it's hard to survive'Cause everytime we touch I get this feelingAnd everytime we kiss I swear I could flyCan't you feel my heart beat fast, I want this to lastNeed you by my side'Cause everytime we touch I feel this staticAnd everytime we kiss I reach for the skyCan't you hear my heart beat so, I can't let you goWant you in my lifeYour arms are my castle, your heart is my skyThey wipe away tears that I cryThe good and the bad times, we've been through them allYou make me rise when I fall'Cause everytime we touch I get this feelingAnd everytime we kiss I swear I could flyCan't you feel my heart beat fast, I want this to lastNeed you by my side'Cause everytime we touch I feel this staticAnd everytime we kiss I reach for the skyCan't you hear my heart beat so, I can't let you goWant you in my life'Cause everytime we touch I get this feelingAnd everytime we kiss I swear I could flyCan't you feel my heart beat fast, I want this to lastNeed you by my side'Cause everytime we touch I feel this staticAnd everytime we kiss I reach for the skyCan't you hear my heart beat so, I can't let you goWant you in my life
