I woke up with a loved one's eyes upon meLoved one's arms around meOh, she's my one and onlyI grew up in the bosom of my familyEight strong arms around meOh, from the seed they've grown meAnd I thank those, those who kept me companyThey are a wall of arms around meOh, it is they who are my armyOh, it is they who are my armyThrough these eyes, there's no god above meNo devil below me, no purgatory, no pearly gates, the worms are what await meIt's only me that can forgive meAnd I have faith, oh, I have faithI have faith, oh, I have faithIn those who putUp with meShe's my one and onlyIf I'm the seed they've grown meThey who are my armyThe wall of arms around meShe's my one and onlyIf I'm the seed they've grown meThey who are my armyThe wall of arms around me
