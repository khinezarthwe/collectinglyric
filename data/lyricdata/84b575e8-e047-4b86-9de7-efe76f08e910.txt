No friend of mine with the future eyes,Woulda wished my vaca on the Yucatan.Oh, but that longish ruddy hair,I might love her if I dared,And I'd probably lose my legs.My baby, wants bad things.I'm trapped in the middle of a labyrinth.Small hope for the quick unwind,Well now I come to find,That she's a lion in disguise.She's a crazy animal when she screams.But in my head I wanted this, it seems.OhShe's a crazy animal when she screams.But in my head I wanted this, it seems.I'll have revenge with an honest hand,When she's buried neck-down in that golden sand,Oh-oh-oh,Make peace, in your eyes I spy the beast,But those beachgoers might save ya,If they got the guts to brave ya, my darling.Nobody, knows nothin,Dear friends keep it quiet like coffins.I'm sunk if she hears, I'm through.You'd find my body cold,No, this goes best the less she knows.She's a crazy animal when she screams.But in my head I wanted this, it seems.She's a crazy animal when she screams.But in my head I wanted this, it seems.She's a crazy animal when she screams.But in my head I wanted this, it seems.OhShe's a crazy animal when she screams.But in my head I wanted this, it seems.
