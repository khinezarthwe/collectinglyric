I would like to leave this cityThis old town don't smell too pretty andI can feel the warning signs running around myMindAnd when I leave this island I'll book myself into a soul asylumAnd I can feel the warning signs running around my mindSo here I go still scratching around the same old holeMy body feels young but my mind is very oldSo what do you say?You can't give me the dreams that are mine anywayYou're half the world awayHalf the world awayHalf the world awayI've been lost I've been found but I don't feel down.And when I leave this planet, y'know I'd stay but I just can't stand itAnd I can feel the warning signs, running around my mindAnd if I could leave this spirit, find me a hole and I will dig itAnd I can feel the warning signs, running around my mindSo here I go still scratching around in the same old holeMy body feels young but my mind if very oldSo what do you say?You can't give me the dreams that are mine anywayYou're half the world awayHalf the world awayHalf the world awayI've been lost I've been found but I don't feel downNo I don't feel down (x2)I don't feel down (x4)
