Shout! Shout! Shout!Shout at the devilShout! Shout! Shout!Shout at the devilHe's the wolf screaming lonely in the nightHe's the blood stain on the stageHe's the tear in your eyeBeen tempted by his lieHe's the knife in your backHe's rageHe's the razor to the knifeOh, lonely is our livesMy head's spinnin' 'round and 'roundBut in the seasons of witherWe'll stand and deliverBe strong and laugh andShout! Shout! Shout!Shout at the devilShout! Shout! Shout!Shout at the devilHe'll be the love in your eyesHe'll be the blood between your thighsAnd then have you cry for moreHe'll put strength to the testHe'll put the thrill back in bedSure you've heard it all beforeHe'll be the risk in the kissMight be anger on your lipsMight run scared for the doorBut in seasons of witherWe'll stand and deliverBe strong and laugh andShout!
