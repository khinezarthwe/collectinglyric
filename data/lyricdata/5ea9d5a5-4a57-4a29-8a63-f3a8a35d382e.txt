So now we seeComes burying my burnt remainsThese puddled cloudsOh I, I understand nowBut darkness falls likes shattered piecesDangling, shimmeringTorn and tattered yet crownedOh I'll not be told "No" to no moreYou must believe to hear me sing theseMessy morsels of my self-assuring loveOh it's painful kneadingYes, I lie and I wrangle with prospective anglesThat glare me down and face me with all I do wrongWhy do they all look like me?So I try and I scream and I beg and I sighJust to prove I'm aliveAnd it's alrightCause tonight there's a way I'll make lightOf my treacherous lifeIf I had hands I'd hold up highMy lofty dreams and my alibi's real nameBut I have no strengthSo I toss and I turn and I spit in the urnThere's a ghost in your eyeThere is someone that knows more than IBut I'm quick to denySo I try and I scream and I beg and I sighJust to prove I'm aliveAnd it's alrightCause tonight there's a way I'll make lightOf my treacherous lifeMake Light!
