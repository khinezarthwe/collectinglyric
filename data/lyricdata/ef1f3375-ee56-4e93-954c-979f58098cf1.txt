Who maddest one on the M1Who hasn't stopped sucking his thumbWho very straight and never grinsWho cares what car he's driving inHe is because he saw it on a commercial breakAnd if he doesn't get what he wantsThen he get a headache'Cos he needs itWants itAlmostLoves itHe's here on his ownOn globe aloneHere on his ownWho joined health club to glistenInto hi-fi precisionWho mobile phone gives him the boneWho very keen on Sharon StoneAnd then he says...Who eats at the new brasserieWho only ever gets merryWho wouldn't be seen at bedtimeWithout putting Calvin Kleins on
