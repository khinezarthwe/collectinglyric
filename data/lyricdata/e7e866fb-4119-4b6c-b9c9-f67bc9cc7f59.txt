Put on your shoes, let's go outside.It's easy for the brilliant light.Avoiding phone calls and long goodbyes.The city skylines always bring big smiles to me,As we sit in our cars, divided by white lines and signs in between.Electronic letters screaming it all gets betterAnd I'm just waiting for you to sing.It's nice to be alive and feel nothing at all.Full credit for the right.Don't shout I hear you.It's gonna be hard.I've already said that to myself it's not worth repeating.You better speak up before the drive.Everyone's hiding something, there's nothing like you said.When you're holding nothing, no one trusts a prayer.Hang from your words and guard your heart,This is just a new found transition.But without reason, I found youWith so much outside my window.You're not here, by my side,So that you could see how little it matters.I'm yours now, you brought me things that I've waited to dream.But it's over when you say so
