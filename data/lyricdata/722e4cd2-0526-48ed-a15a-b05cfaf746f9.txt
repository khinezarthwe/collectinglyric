You mesmerize slowlyTill I can't believe my eyesEcstasy controls meWhat you give just serves me rightWithout warning you're hereLike magic you appearI taste the fearI'm so afraidBut I still feed the flameIn the night, come to meYou know I want your touch of evilIn the night, please set me freeI can't resist a touch of evilAroused with desireYou put me in a tranceA vision of fireI never had a chanceA dark angel of sinPreying deep from withinCome take me inI'm so afraidBut I still feed the flameIn the night, come to meYou know I want your touch of evilIn the night, please set me freeI can't resist a touch of evilArousing me now with a sense of desirePossessing my soul till my body's on fireA dark angel of sinPreying deep from withinCome take me inYou're possessing meIn the night, come to meYou know I want your touch of evilIn the night, please set me freeI can't resist a touch of evilIn the night, come to meYou know I want your touch of evilIn the night, please set me freeI can't resist a touch of evilA touch of evilA touch of evilA touch of evilTouch
