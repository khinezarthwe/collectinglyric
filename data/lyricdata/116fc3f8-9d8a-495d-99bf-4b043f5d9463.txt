This is my hour, I'm never going to bed.The sky is still black, but begs to be red.I just put my book down, but it begs to be readI'm not nod, I'm not napper, never rest my head.Some days I feel I'm getting smaller and smaller,But some nights, I seem to grow taller and taller.And we keep shrinkin' and shrinkin' but this will not finish.You're never nothing, if you didn't disappear.Just when I discovered the meaning of life, they change it.Just when I'm loving life, it seems to start raining.I pulled the sail safe switch, sea sail and I'm aimed at the stars.I love the rain on my scars. The sky's now red, my eyes reflect jest.Smiling at this blessing, this life is the best.(Refrain)I came to this world with nothingAnd I leave with nothing but loveEverything else is just borrowedI want to notice chances I've passed without noticeI want to see details previously veiled.I want to grab that chance, carry it homeSo I can marry and knowThat I noticed every chanceThat I could have passed without noticeI saw details that to all were veiled.And I grabbed those chances, carried them homeAnd then I'll have had it with roaming(Refrain)I came to this world with nothingAnd I leave with nothing but loveEverything else is just borrowedI want to speak every cliche but tweak if I've seen changeIn a new way it could be said.If it's bleak, or if the week's leaking down the streetor if any days wasted I want to face facts.My time on this earth is my only penny,Wise is the gent counting every moment spent.I don't want to explain things, don't wanna fill in the gaps,I want to look at my friends and, in that minute, be at.(Girl singing)Memories are times we borrowFor spending tomorrow.Memories are times we borrowFor spending tomorrow.(Refrain)I came to this world with nothingAnd I leave with nothing but loveEverything else is just borrowedIt's a bit like luck, you can only seemTo borrow it, you can't keep it.When the wind of change whistles into playWill I blink or flinch away?The wind of change won't whistle me awayIf I spin my tails and sail.And sail away, let yesterday become today.(Refrain)I came to this world with nothingAnd i leave with nothing but loveEverything else is just borrowedAs time will say nothing but'I told you so'(Girl singing)Memories are times we borrowfor spending tomorrow.
