Ain't nobody gonna steal this heart awayAin't nobody gonna steal this heart awayWhen the war is overGot to get awayPack my bag to no placeIn no time no dayYou and I we used each other's shoulderStill so young but somehow so much olderHow can I go home and not getBlown awayYou and I had our sights setOn somethingHope this doesn't mean our days are numberedI got plans for more than a wanted manAll around this chaos and madnessCan't help feeling nothing more than sadnessOnly choice to face it the best I canWhen the war is overGot to start againTry to hold a trace of what it wasBack thenYou and I we sent each other storiesJust a page I'm lost in all its gloryHow can I go home and not get blown awayAin't nobody gonna steal this heart awayAin't nobody gonna steal this heart awayAin't nobody gonna steal this heart awayAin't nobody gonna steal this heart awayAin't nobody gonna steal this heart awayAin't nobody gonna steal this heart away
