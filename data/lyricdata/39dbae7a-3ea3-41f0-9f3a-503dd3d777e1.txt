GoSo here we go again,Another time but it feels the sameGot sick of waiting hereSet sail on concrete wavesNo survivors left to saveToo late for the walking deadWe'll make it on our ownBreathing our own airCus no one else will careNo one really knowsNeed more room to shoutTime is running outBut even through your doubtsWe will still be here(We will still be here)Seeing all I seeAND I still killStill kill the old wayIm gonna die before I fallDon't try to save meMoving on to a different placePeople hide but I see their faceOne that's full of hateTheir apathy is not affecting usMaybe they ride on a different busRealized I would never changeWe'll make it on our ownBreathing our own airCus no one else will careNo one really knowsNeed more room to shoutTime is running outAnd even through your doubtsWe will still be here(We will still be here)Seeing all I see and,And I still killStill kill the old wayIm gonna die before I falldon't try to save meooohh wohh X3Last time Ill fallOhhh WohhOhhh Wohh WohhThis is the last time Ill fallSeeing all I seeAnd I still killStill kill the old wayIm gonna die before I fallNo one save me.....Seeing all I seeAnd I still killStill kill the old wayIm gonna die before I fall.Don't try to save me
