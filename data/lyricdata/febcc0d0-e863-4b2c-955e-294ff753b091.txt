Got my pants caught in the chainYeah me & my bicycle were falling downShe's one of the girls who likes to playBut she don't like cards, rumi cubeOr the guess who gameHow the wolf roams through the nightHow she tends to remind me how to close the doorBut excuse me mary but are your sheep whiteCause you better run tell the shepherd not anymoreHow much of you is real?How much of you did they steal?How much of you is in those pills?How much of you is real?How much of you is real?I know you're here but you're just not thereThe simple thing of it is thatIt just kicked in my mind now there's no turningIt just kicked in my mindNow there's no turning back
