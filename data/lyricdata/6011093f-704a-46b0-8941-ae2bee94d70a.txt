(Music & Lyrics: Kurt Cobain)Portray sincerity, act out of loyaltyDefend every country, wish away painHand out lobotomies to save little familiesSurrealistic fantasy bland, boring, plain.Hold me down in restitutionLiving out your date with fusion.Is the whole thing shun in bastard?Don't feel guilty masturbating.Somebody said that they're not much like I amI know I canMake enough of the words as you go alongI sink then some.Slippery pessimist, hypocrite masterConservative Communist, apocalyptic bastardThank you, dear God, for putting me on this EarthI feel very privileged in debt for my thirst.Hold me down in restitutionLiving out your date with fusion.Is the whole fleece shun in bastard?Don't feel guilty masturbating.Somebody said that they're not much like I amI know I canMake enough of the words as you go alongI sing then some.
