Too self obsessed and too much TVUnderneath this avalanche of golden teethI didn't get much sleep at the start of the weekUnderneath this avalanche of golden teethIt's like my chest is caving inA starch black dress on a CEOAnd as you stretch your skin for another photoYour face is caving inIf I'm paid for my time, it'll be just fineWatch me dip my hand in the iodineMy chest is caving inLong time no see, where have you beenBefore I get to say it you get taken awayYou never go but you never stayMy secrets smell like spit and everybody knowsI'll hang myself with the cord of the telephoneMy chest is caving inI get so bored that my teeth start to hurtIn this museum of neon t-shirtsThis room is caving inWhen we're both coming down but you still come aroundYou can sleep on the bed and I'll sleep on the groundMy heart is caving in
