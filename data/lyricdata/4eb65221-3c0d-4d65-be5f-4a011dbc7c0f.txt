Yeah safe man, you ok?Just calling to ensure you got back inHope you coped yesterday, cos I felt well damn grimBut yeah in the air on the plane my stomach was turningMan I was hanginghead-to-sted on the headrest in painPrayed away all my bad sinsLost count of the plain chardonnays before the fourth or maybe the fifthIn future I need to abstainIf only id had a bit of disciplineBut worth every bit of spare changePure clowning down to the last drink(Hang on let me slam the door mate; just pause that thought for a bit)Why did I have to go and do a stupid thing like thatCoz yeah it felt like we were through thoughBut I could've ruined it, I'm such a twatI've been pacing the place well paralysed since I got back in with my bags thoughYeah I'm too aware that last night was way mad slackI knowCarried in a gang I lost sight of SimoneOn her own back at homeDistracted from the fact it weren't rightcould have raised up the hand but noSimone was moaning and that about me playing away on this holidayShe was watching the box at her dad's housethere, preparing spliffs awayAs I'm smacking glasses down at George Bests best session rate(Can you hear me? Na sorry mate your fuzzy mate I can't hear ya)Why did I have to go and do a stupid thing like thatCoz yeah it felt like we were through thoughBut I could've ruined it, I'm such a twat(I lost you for a minute yeah yeah I can hear you now)See I mean that the true thing though I suppose I chose myself to allowI was weak and stupid but as far as I viewed anyhowShe couldn't have been it for me, the only girl id ever go out withI didn't want to waste my youth in a girl's house to the sound of spliffsAnd when she got in a mood with me in that text about that thingI just switched off the phone when she started shoutingComing to a conclusion I couldn't be bothered with anymore rowingWhy did I have to go and do a stupid thing like thatCoz yeah it felt like we were through thoughBut I could've ruined it, I'm such a twat(Nah nah nah)And then after shots made me lose the plotIt all got a bit bizarreAnd that incident with the ice cream I forgot, it all ended in our vodkaWhat I can remembers a blotchI got a fat bruise on my armShe weren't even much too hot but she totally mugged me up like rahShe knew exactly what she was doing and it all went a bit too farShe was with that bloke in the white top in McDonalds car parkAnd then she let me chat her up later on in that lovely little bar(Hello?
