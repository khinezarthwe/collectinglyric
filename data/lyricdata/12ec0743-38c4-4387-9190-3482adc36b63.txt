Morbid fascination instilled within our youngRaised and weaned on cold steel, the damage it has brungLittle plastic war toys always within reachReplicas of war, what lessons do they teachPre-chorus:Minimal control, that's why this land is greatAccidental death, the lesson learned too lateEscalating tensions sweeping 'cross our landA gun beneath your pillow you fail to understandImages of violence flicker on the screenTaken in by young eyes unsure of what it meansViolent heritage echoed in their gamesCountless shattered lives, no one learns their namesRepeat pre-chorusChorus:Violent by nature (4x)Solo: LykinsChildren raised on violence, soon no place to runSetting fights with bullets, the nightmare's just begunStaring out the window, your child plays with friendsWaving plastic pistols, the circle never endsRepeat pre-chorusRepeat chorus
