Help, my sonbreak these words like breadonto the fieldand when January all so warmWith this, confusion buildsAnd I host their dayAnd I brought those nightsBut then suddenlyit all came down to the fightTurn your head you were held by nothingand across your face we could all read everythingGive a kiss to enemyand free them from your fateHow can this be they danceand we, we are the sameAnd I host their dayAnd I brought them sightBut then suddenlyit all came down to the fightTurn your head you were held by nothingand across your face we could all read everythingYou could be, you could be anythingLa la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la laTurn your head you were held by nothingand across your face we could all read everythingYou could be, you could be anything
