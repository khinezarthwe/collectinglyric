One day in El PasoThe cops go into the crowdUnder a glaring bladder of lightAnd the music is so loudAnd the tourists take their t-shirts offA busload of kids gives you the fingerAfternoon when the sidewalk's hotAnd the shadow's too chilly to lingerWalk past damaged goods and ugly trendsPast a straw man making a purchaseDown town where the river bendsThey're just waiting for you to resurfaceTake a look at this photographClearly his teeth were baredHe could have been yawning or snarlingThe story was never clearOne night in El PasoThe cops go into the crowdUnder a throbbing bladder of lightAnd the music is just so loudAnd the tourists turn their TV's offAnd a bat sees a bug with the sound of a lingerNight time when the shadows coughAnd you're chilled to the tips of your fingersWalk past damaged goods and ugly trendsPast old straw man making a purchaseDown town where the river bendsThey're just waiting for you to resurfaceTake a look at this photographClearly his teeth were baredHe could have been yawning or snarlingThis could have been anywhereTake a look at this photographClearly his teeth were baredHe could have been yawning or snarlingThe story was never clear
