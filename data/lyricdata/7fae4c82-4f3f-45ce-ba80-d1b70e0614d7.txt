Chorus:Heyah Heyah Heyah Heyah Hey,i'm thinking about you, i'm a loveshy babegot to got to get together be strongcuz i know our love will be coming and i won't be loveshy anymoreVerse 1:Sometimes I run when I wanna stay,Cause of the life that were living,You gotta watch what your saying,And when I see you I wanna hide,I'm a little afraid of the feeling,But what you you want your losingAnd deep inside is a love,Caling out your name,But I'm not the kinda boy,To pay the price thay you say,Dont think that i dont wanna get involed with you,Cause all I wanna do is try to understand baby,ChorusVerse 2:Try to be patient I know its hard,But what do you want from a writer,Whos still kinda single,And when you think of attention straight,Remember the love is a waiter,Cause its a life dont confuse itYou know I spend the first saturday nights,In the telephone where I can get in touch and then say things,For the emotion takes my mind out all the time,For now the sun is shining I wont be love shy anymore,Chorus x2Ive be watching you watching me,And I know your on it,I'm a little love shy boy,So why dont you put your number on this paper,Maybe I will call you later,I need love I need trust,Anything you got for its all good,I like it like this I like it like that,I know your shy boy,I know you like this,Give me your number come on over be my souljah boy,Ill give you my number,I will show you how you shout it boy.Chorus x 2
