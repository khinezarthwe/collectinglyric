Lips bleed from the ringsAll these little bruisesThe little thingsThat provoke the segregationLead the separationCage and clip the wingsLittle noisesThe little screamsThat stop the operationConscious amputationJust do what you doWhat you doWhat you did to meNow I'm stuck in betweenA rock and nowhereWith nothingWith no oneJust do what you doWhat you doWhat you've done to meDraw the chalk lineAround the scene, it's overNow it's all overBroken heart that's lost its beatA little boy, that softly weepsOverwhelmed with emotionViews burns through explosionLost the forest through the treesLittle whispers, the little dreamsThat sparked the recollectionConstant suffocationJust do what you doWhat you doWhat you did to meNow I'm stuck in betweenA rock and nowhereWith nothingWith no oneJust do what you doWhat you doWhat you've done to meDraw the chalk lineAround the scene, it's overNow it's all overI can feel my life is changingChangingI can feel my heart is jadedJadedLeft the sticks, left the stonesWords don't hurt, mend the bonesI can feel my life is changing-Solo-Just do what you doWhat you doWhat you did to meNow I'm stuck in betweenA rock and nowhereWith nothingWith no oneJust do what you doWhat you doWhat you've done to meDraw the chalk lineAround the scene, it's overNow it's all overErase the past and leave the painCleanse the wounds and forget the nameLost the will, ran far awaySo it's all overSpread the ash and fill the graveLost the tongue and make my wayDo what you do and go awayNow it's all over
