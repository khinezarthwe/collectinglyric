She lights a candleBut she doesn't know whyShe wants to save meBut I'm barely aliveMy soul is thirstyI just wanna get high andMake her go awayNow I'm hitting the wallAnd she begs me to quitAnd she drags me to churchBut I'm scared to commitAnd I'm losing my mind'Cause she hides all my shitShe won't go awayAnd all I ask of her isPray for me'Cause I don't want toPray for meIf you love meCross your heart andHope that I won't dieBefore the best day of my lifeJust pray for me tonightI drug myself outOf the bed that she madeAnd I escape herIn a black motorcadeShe's pushing BiblesAnd a clean bill of healthI can't make her go awayNow I'm hitting the wallAnd she begs me to quitAnd she drags me to churchBut I'm scared to commitAnd I'm losing my mind'Cause she hides all my shitShe won't go awayAnd all I ask of her isPray for me'Cause I don't want toPray for meIf you love meCross your heart andHope that I won't dieBefore the best day of my lifeJust pray for me tonight
