It's who dares wins in the citySit prettyLocked On not TripoliGet dressed for the partyAs i spit simile after simileGot the latest Nikes on my feetThe streets merely reflect this bass line and beatLock on to 102.6 the streetsKronenburg double doves and herbs actions speak louder than wordsGet fucked up sat on the curbStreet geezersAccept me as your ownLet me make myself at homeI just ain't a cloneStill got the monsta boy ring tone thoughRaised as a northern starWith a London underground travel card.
