When you see me you can't resistYou want my name on your telephone listIn your dreams and on your mindTonight's the night I could make you mineLater on just me and youI could make your dreams come trueYou say for you I'm number oneJust meeting me is such funOh no, you won't go, don't know what you're missinYou say, you won't stay, you stop me when we're kissinStop me when we're kissinYou come backstage to talk awhileI wanna party 'cause that's my styleYoung & tight you're what I needYour fantasies I wanna feedSo come with me, back to my placeYou know you've got such a pretty faceI'll show you how it is to beHanging around with a rocker like meTellin me you've gotta runCuttin out before the damage is doneCome on babe that ain't no fun for meCuttin down ain't where it's atYou're just a tease and that's a factNo more talk it's going nowhereAnd neither are you, you just sit and stareTime to go I'll say goodbyeI thought I saw tears in your eyesYou watch me leave in my limousineAnd you go home to your poster dreams
