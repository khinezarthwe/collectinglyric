Each evening the sun sets in five billion placesSeen by ten billion eyes set in five billion facesThen they close in a daze and wait for the dawningBut the daylight and sunriseAre brighter in our eyesWhere night cannot devour golden solar powerOnce we were dammned, now I guess we are angelsFor we passed though the dark and avoided the dangersThen I awoke with a start to startling changesAll the tension is endedThe sentance suspendedAnd darkenss now sparkles and gleamsAnd it all seems larger than life to meI find it rather hard rather hard to believeSo I stand as the sound goes straight through my bodyI'm so bloated up, happy, and I throw things around meAnd I'm growing in stages, and have been for agesJust singing and floating and freeDum de dum dumIt's a heavenly pop hitIf anyone wants itDum de dum dumIt's a heavenly pop hitIt's something that we're humming asWe swoop low on trees, or we sweep under carpetsWe can dive into suns, though it's not recommendedWe can hover, silent, and listen, closely...It all seems (all seems)Larger than life to meI find it (find it)Hard to believeSo where was our homeWell, our home was in tearsFor its fruit has gone badThey'd been that way for yearsYet their lives are elasticThey should be fantasticThey should be expandingDum de dum dumDum de dum dumIt's a heavenly pop hitIf anyone wants itDum de dum dumDum de dum dumIt's a heavenly pop hitFor anybodyFor those that still want it
