I'm out on my own againFace down in the porcelainFeeling so high but looking so lowParty favors on the floorGroup of girls banging on the doorSo many new fair-weather friendsOh, oh, ohHave you ever been so lost?Known the way and still so lost?Caught in the eye of a hurricaneSlowly waving goodbye like a pageant paradeSo sick of this town pulling me down, ohMy mother says I should come back homeBut can't find the way 'cause the way is goneSo, if I pray, am I just sending words into outer space?Have you ever been so lost?Known the way and still so lostAnother night waiting for someone to take me homeHave you ever been so lost?Is there a light?Is there a lightAt the end of the road?I'm pushing everyone away'Cause I can't feel this anymoreCan't feel this anymoreHave you ever been so lost?Know the way and still so lostAnother night waiting for someone to take me homeHave you ever been so lost?Have you ever been so lost?
