I should be calling collect from jailFor the things I commit each night in my headLike last night in my sleep, I got to snuff youBut then I woke up again, safe in my little bedNo one is safeWhen I close my eyesI come to take your lifeI get to force your untimely disappearanceEach night in my dreams, when I'm fast asleepI close my eyes and you just vanishSoon as I lay down my head, when I'm dead to the whole wide worldNo one is safeWhen I close my eyesI come to take your lifeAnd then I wake up againAnd it was all just a dreamAnd everything is the same(Sleepwalker) Did I give you concrete shoesAnd throw your body off of a bridge?(Sleepwalker) When I lay down to sleep, pray your soul is mine to keepI feel you near me(Go to sleep... Go to sleep... Go to sleep...)(Sleepwalker)(Go to sleep... Go to sleep... Go to sleep...)Just taking a stroll...Don't go to sleep!Here's some toothpicks for your eyes!You always make an excellent cadaverI roll up your body in a carpet to make musicIn the trunk of my limousine, wrapped up in a rugA fitting end is that I send you up the river like a punkNo one is safeWhen I close my eyesI come to take your lifeThe angel of death is pissed off at me againJust because I got to put you out of my miseryIt doesn't matter, I am without fearNow that you're dead, I won't shed another bloody tear for youNo one is safeWhen I close my eyesI come to take your lifeI'm calling down the thunderThen you'll sleep with the fishesThe answer to all of my wishes(Sleepwalker) Did I tell you I was in moviesThen dump you garotted, lying naked in a ditch?(Sleepwalker) Everyday, another wayI know you can hear meI think you'd look nice in a Colombian necktieShould stop your tongue from wagging the dogNo more stupidity from you, as I pull your tongue throughFor a smile from ear to ear, now there's nothing to hearNo one is safeWhen I close my eyesI come to take your lifeAnd then I wake up againAnd it was all just a dreamAnd everything is still the same(Sleepwalker) Did I give you concrete shoesAnd throw your body off of a bridge?(Sleepwalker) When I lay down to sleep, pray your soul is mine to keepI feel you near me(Sleepwalker) Or did I tell you I was in moviesThen dump you garotted, lying naked in a ditch?(Sleepwalker) Everyday, another wayI know you can hear me(Sleepwalker) Did I buy you the farm?Put a horse head in your bed?(Sleepwalker) When I lay down to sleep, pray your soul is mine to keepI feel you near me(Sleepwalker) EverydayEveryday, another way(Sleepwalker) When I lay down to sleep, pray your soul is mine to keepI know you can hear me(Sleepwalker)(Sleepwalker)(Sleepwalker)
