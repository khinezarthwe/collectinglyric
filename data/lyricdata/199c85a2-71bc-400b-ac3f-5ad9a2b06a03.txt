We've had a good timeEasy living like on a summerdayWe got along fineEven though we haven't had a lot to sayIt's been alrightBut much to my regretI know that if I remain by your sideI might as well be deadSo glad we made itTime will never change itBut finallyI have to get on with my lifeLife is a gameThat one plays according to the rulesForget my nameMaybe it will help you feeling coolI have to move outGot to carry onDon't you know that only time will tellIf I'm right or wrongÂ ?So glad we made itTime will never change itBut finallyI have to get on with my lifeI feel a rush in my bloodWhile I listen to the sound of musicWho you are and what you want to beIt doesn't matter much to meSo glad we made itTime will never change itBut finallyI have to get on with my lifeFinallyI have to get on with my lifeFinallyI have to get on with my lifeFinallyI have to get on with my lifeFinallyI have to get on with my life
