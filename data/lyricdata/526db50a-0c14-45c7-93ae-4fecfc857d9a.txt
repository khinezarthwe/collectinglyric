In a trance in France I learned to danceIn a trance in France I learned to danceAnd got me a piece of tailThey put my body in a hotel lobbyAnd my soul in a neon jailBig dealYou're gonna be a big, big dealTrained seals are always a real big dealThey put me in a cage and they put me on stageAnd they told me I could never go homeThe government paid for a place in the shadeAnd then my mouth began to foamBig dealNobody cares how you feelBig dealYou're gonna be a big big dealAll your little actionsAre just tourist attractionsAnd the kids are gonna gobble you upThey're gonna stand in a crowdThey will yell very loudAnd they've think they've fallenFallen in loveI'm totally certain a big red curtain'sGonna rise at Carnegie HallAnd everybody that I hate isGonna find out too late that I've becomeA big dealYou're gonna be a big, big dealTrained seals are always a real big dealBig dealYou're gonna be a big, big dealTrained seals are always a real big dealA bloody mess, and I'm still bleedingBut I am alive, my heart is beatingA bloody mess, and I'm still bleedingBut I am alive, my heart is beating
