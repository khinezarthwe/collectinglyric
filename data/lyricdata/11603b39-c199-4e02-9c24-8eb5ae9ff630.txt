Trying to rise the waterIt was a love that filled the seaDreamt it kept on risingA haunted love was sheDreamt of raging firesSwept around the bendDreamt I had a nightmareThe cities burning down againThe cities burning down againAnd the storm it kept on comingAll the while I saw the sunThen the earth made a soundAnd I heard it tempt meThe cities burning down againThe cities burning down againSo help me out pleaseSo help me out pleaseOh, ITrying to rise the waterIt was a love that filled the seaDreamt I had a nightmareThe cities falling down on meThe cities falling down on meThe cities burning down againThe cities burning down again
