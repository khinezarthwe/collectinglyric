You've got discomfort on your skin and it's conquered youDiscontent down your spine has got you beatI've seen you dance, laugh and sing with no sense of abandonAnd when you go,You'll make sure it's slow so people knowI've seen you, you show itI've seen you, you shown itYou've got discomfort on your skin and it's conquered youDiscontent down your spine has got you beatI've seen you dance, laugh and sing with no sense of abandon'Cause then when you go,You'll make sure it's slow so people knowI've seen you, you show itI've seen you, you shown itYou've got no sense of abandon'Cause I've seen you, you show itI've been watching you waste it away'Cause it shows in your smileNo one can tell you what's best for youSo play dead, embrace your feetYou've been taught to sing but you can't buy abandonDon't forget to strive,You should never deprive yourself of prideI've seen you, you show itI've seen you, you show it
