After we spoke I had a dream that I brokeThe teeth from a mouth of a snakeThen I choked on the teethThey were mine all alongI picked up the pieces when I wokePut them in a boat made of things that I don't want to seeI blew on the sailWatched it drift out to seaThe further it drifted the closer it came to meI can't explainSo I took it apart in a billion boxesThere was only one thingYou might think I'm your enemyBut that don't make you mineAnd all I have now is sympathyI wish that you'd stop tryingOh, please stop lyingStop la la la la la la laLa la la la la…The hatred in the box then I locked itThe strongest one I madeI buried it all, grew a tree without thornsSat beneath its shadeYou might think I'm your enemyBut that don't make you mineAnd all I have now is sympathyI wish that you'd stop tryingOh please stop lyingPlease stop la la la la la laLa la la la la…La la la la la la la…La la la la la…
