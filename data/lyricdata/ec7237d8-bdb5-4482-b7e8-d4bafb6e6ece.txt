I've been waiting all night long,I've been waiting to sing your song,Tonight, you help me,Just help me find your key.I run my hands down your neck,Cross your back to another fret,I know you're fragile,You're bound to self destructI can see right through your skin,Your bones are hollow, they're paper thin.Tonight, you're weightless,I know the way you feelSo tryTry lifting all your weightFor a manA man you're grownAnd tryTry wasting all your daysOn a manA man like meOur love is a lot like yours,It's been crippled by the wars,We wage, we're hopeless,We're on the losing side.We never speak when we're making love,You never mean it when you come to me,With your arms stretched,Defenseless and aloneSo tryTry lifting all your weightFor a manA man you're grownAnd tryTry wasting all your daysOn a manA man like meI taste you on my fingersAnd I smell you on my lipsI don't know where you're goingBut you're going to slipHey honey better save yourselfYou're never gonna make itHey honey, honey better save yourselfYou're never gonna make itSo tryTry lifting all your weightFor a manA man you're grownAnd tryTry wasting all your daysOn a manA man like me
