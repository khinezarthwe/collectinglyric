Now as the summer fades, I let you slip awayYou say I'm not your type, but I can make you swayIt makes you burn to learn you're not the only oneI'd let you be if you put down your blazing gunNow you've gone somewhere else far awayI don't know if I will find you (Find you, find you)But you feel my breath on your neckCan't believe I'm right behind you (Right behind you)'Cause you keep me coming back for moreAnd I feel a little better than I did beforeIf I never see your face again, I don't mind'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonightSometimes you move so well it's hard not to give inI'm lost, I can't tell where you end and I beginIt makes me burn to learn you're with another manÂ¹I wonder if he's half the lover that I amNow you've gone somewhere else far awayI don't know if I will find you (Find you, find you)But you feel my breath on your neckCan't believe I'm right behind you (Right behind you)'Cause you keep me coming back for moreAnd I feel a little better than I did beforeIf I never see your face again, I don't mind'Cause we've gone much further than I thought we'd get tonightBaby, baby, please believe meFind it in your heart to reach mePromise not to leave me behind (Promise not to leave me behind)Take me down, but take it easyMake me think, but don't deceive meTorture me by taking your time (Torture me, torture me)'Cause you keep me coming back for moreAnd I feel a little better than I did beforeIf I never see your face again, I don't mind'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight (Torture me, torture me)You keep me coming back for moreAnd I feel a little better than I did beforeIf I never see your face again, I don't mind'Cause we've gone much further than I thought we'd get tonight
