He is the angel with the scabbed wings,Hard drug face, wanna powder his noseHe will deflower the freshest cropDry up all the wombs with his rock and roll sores(Rock and roll sores)(Rock and roll sores)DeadIs what he is, he does what he pleaseThe things that he has you're never gonna seeWhat you're never gonna be nowSketch a little keyhole for the looking-glass people.You don't want to see him,You only want to be him.Mommy's got a scare crow, gotta let the corn grow.Man can't always reap what he sow."He is the maker"(He is the taker)"He is the saviour"(He is the raper)DeadIs what he is, he does what he pleaseThe things that he has you're never gonna seeWhat you're never gonna be nowSketch a little keyhole for the looking-glass people.You don't want to see him,You only want to be him.Mommy's got a scare crow, gotta let the corn grow.Man can't always reap what he sow.(chorus)Get back you're never gonna leave himGet back, you're always gonna please him.He is the angel with the scabbed wings,Hard drug face, wanna powder his noseHe will deflower the freshest cropDry up all the wombs with hisRock and roll sores.Rock and roll sores.Rock and roll sores.Rock and roll sores.Rock and roll sores.Rock and roll sores.Rock and roll sores.Rock and roll sores.Rock and roll sores.Rock and roll sores.
