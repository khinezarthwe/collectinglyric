Tears fill up my eyesI'm washed away with sorrowAnd somewhere in my mindI know there's no tomorrowI see you're leaving soonI guess you've had your fillBut if I can't change your mindThen no one willAnd all throughout the yearsI've never strayed from you my dearBut you suspect I'm somewhere elseYou're feeling sorry for yourselfLeaving with a broken heartI love you even stillBut if I can't change your mindThen no one willEven though my heart keeps breakingDon't you know that I'll be waitingHere for youThen when you returnWhen will you returnI hope you see I'm dedicatedLook how long that I have waitedIf you come back then you will findA different personIf you change your mindHow can I explain awaySomething that I haven't doneAnd if you can't trust me nowYou'll never trust in anyoneWith all the crazy doubts you've gotI love you even stillBut if I can't change your mindThen no one willSomeday you'll see I've been trueI'll stay that way untilBut if I can't change your mindThen no one will
