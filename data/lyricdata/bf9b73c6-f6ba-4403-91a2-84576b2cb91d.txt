As pretty as a songA song could ever beLike Christmas on a riverWithout a boat or Christmas treeThis afternoon with you was something like a letterThe kind that someone writes but never sendsAnd when you look at me like thatI know someday it's gonna endAnd when you get oldI bet you miss your friendsAs angry as a breezeTugging hard upon the sailsI been moving through these streets foreverFrom Baltimore to AmsterdamThese things inside me they repeat like broken recordsSpinning pretty somethings behind my eyesAnd when I can't look at youI can paint your picture perfectly in my mindAnd when I get oldI'm gonna miss you all the timeThat wind up in the treesScattering bluebirds all over the placeShuffling children in the piles of leavesI wish I was the wind, I'd touch your faceThis afternoon with you was something like a letterThe kind that someone writes but never sendsAnd when you're good to meIt makes me blue cause someday it's gonna endAnd when we pass onI bet you miss your friendsBet you miss your friendsI bet you miss your friends
