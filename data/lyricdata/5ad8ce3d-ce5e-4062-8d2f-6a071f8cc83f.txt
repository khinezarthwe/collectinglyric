Waiting out on the bloodlineYou know I heard the callTry to make this experienceIt doesn't work at allAnd now I try to recallJust one reason why I started at allDon't know why I even started at allWell I'm a mess when I'm hungryYou better leave me aloneAnd to me you're the dearestThat's why I'm off on my ownAnd now I try to recallJust one reason why I started at allDon't know why I even started at allIn the eveningI find myself just waiting for the coming afternoonI put all my trust in youYou were my only chanceMy final chanceAnd now I knowThat when it's overI'll be standing here with nothing at allStanding silent with my back to the wallAnd you say why did I bother at allDon't know why I even bothered at allNothing at allNothing at all
