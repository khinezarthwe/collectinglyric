Here it comes againLike the first time againI can't sleepI watch the rainBut I'm happy againHow can this beWhy did this feelingCreep on up on me?I can't be sureYou never canBut the signs I knowWhere does it come from?Where does it go?Why does it kill youPainful and slow?I'm out of the fireI'm into your homeI wanna feel you, feel you, feel youFeel you againIt makes you a cheatIt makes you a liarStep out of the fireIt gives a spring in the stepSmile on the faceSing like a birdYa running the race againWhat makes you badMakes you feel much betterThan you ever canYou can't touch it, see it, breathe itFeel it's all you canIt makes the world go roundIt makes you homeward boundIt makes you want it moreLook around every cornerTo see if there's more aroundYou wanna take it all, it's never quite enoughYou know ya need it all!You wanna feel it, feel it, feel itFeel it againIt kill you in the endBut not to have itYou haven't livedIt will break youMake youTake youHate you, againFrom me to youFrom you to meLook out your windowAnd you will feel it, feel it, feel itFeel it more, more, moreHere it comes againThat feeling againI can't sleepSit and watch the rainAgain...watch the rainAgain...
