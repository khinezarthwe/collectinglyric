So far so good,The obstacles fall where they should.The sky is clear for miles,And Judy erupts with a smile.She's free from her uglier ways.Breakdown - abandon all that you know.Breakdown - let your bitterness go.The Curse of having it all,Would creep up like a brick wall."Nothing's good enough" she'd say,Until nothing's what she'd do all day.Hostile and sad,He made her turn bad.Breakdown - abandon all that you know.Smile now - it's over and time to go home.
