Voices are calling from somewhere bellowmelting on the eastern shoreRain is falling down on me,been waiting for eternity...I'll be there!Freedom for us all!And I wonder why, why my heart still yearnsand I wonder why, why the earth still turnsand I wonder why, why the sky turns blackStill I wonder why, but there is no turning backFor all eternity, for all the world to seewe're riding high across the windand when the storm begins, to wash away all sinswe'll find a place where we'll beginThere's something wrong with the world today,only the people that are fighting for......a better place in the world today,they don't believe that they gone too far,...they're falling down.By moonlight there's a way... for rebellionhere, the world has gone astray... revolutionNow, the time has come to pray... hallelujahdeep, inside our minds we wait... for rebellionHere in dreamland we will not obey the masters... and the earth still turns but I'm on my way,he is on the way, as my heart still yearns... I'm on my way, now he is on the way,and I cry for moreYes I'm on my way, now he is on the way,gonna find the secret wallI have seen the secret dreamsof those who know eternityand makes me feel like a shadow sneaking inIn my sleep I'm searching for a way to findthe open door leading me to where it all beginsThere's nothing wrong with the world today...By moonlight there's a way... for rebellionhere, the world has gone astray... revolutionNow, the time has come to pray... hallelujahdeep, inside our minds we wait... for rebellionHere in dreamland we will not obey the mastersSOLO: KaiNow I'm riding through the airgoing to where no one dareson the way I'll cross the line forevermore.For once in life, I do not carenothing matters, now I dareOn the ride I'll cross the lineforever to be freeHave no fear, Rebellion is here!
