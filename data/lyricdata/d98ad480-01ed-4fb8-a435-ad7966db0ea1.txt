"I'm feeling this timeAs bad as never beforeA bleeding wag is fading awayOnce you needed meFor spending delightBut below the funny maskThere's a crying faceThe way that I smile is the way that I cryBut you'll never realizeMy reputation is the one of a foolNow watch how poet diesHear his cries(Chorus)And I dedicate my roses to no oneCause there is no mind to help me to seeThe reason we needA light for the lonesomeAnd no none to drinkThe blood that I bleedThe poet inside - wasn't given a chanceSo he had to live apartAnd I realized - my best friend am IAnd not those parasitesWho try to stare into my heartThe way that I feel is the way that I healMy body and soul and my lifeAnd I know you just think I'm a foolNow watch how a poet flies, see me rise(Chorus)And I dedicate my roses to no oneCause there is no mind to help to seeThe reason we needA light for the lonesomeAnd no one to drinkThe blood that I bleed(Solo: Jens)(Chorus)And I dedicate my roses to no oneCause there's no mind to help me to seeThe reason we needA light for the lonesomeAnd no one to drink the blood that I bleedAnd I dedicate my roses to no oneCause there's no mind to help me to seeThe reason we needA light for the lonesomeAnd no one to drink the blood that I bleed"
