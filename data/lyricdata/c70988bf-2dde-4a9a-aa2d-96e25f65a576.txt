I don't know why I let you goYou said you'd wait I said I'd hope you wouldWe talked 'til late until we walked awayWhat's meant to be will be the sameAnd I feel like stoneYes I feel ice coldI pick myself up from the groundSick to death of lying downAnd now I have to find you once againYou're in my soulYou're in my mindBut I don't know where you are nowYou're in my soulYou're in my mindBut I don't know where you are nowDriving round and round until its dawnTo look for you in rooms we used to goI held you back, I had to set you freeBut now I know what's meant to beAnd I feel like stoneYes I feel ice coldI pick myself up from the groundSick to death of lying downAnd now I have to find you once againYou're in my soulYou're in my mindBut I don't know where you are nowYou're in my soulYou're in my mindBut I don't know where you are nowYou're in my soulYou're in my mindBut I don't know where you are nowYou're in my soulYou're in my mindBut I don't know where you are now
