And we stare each other downLike victims in the grindProbing all the weakness and hurt still left behindAnd we cryThese tears of pearlsWe do it. Oh we do it.Is love really the tragedyThe way you might describe?Or would a thousand loversStill leave you cold inside?Make you cry...These tears of pearlsChorus:All these mixed emotionsWe keep locked awayLike stolen pearlsStolen pearl devotionsWe keep locked away from all the worldYour kisses are like pearls,So different and so rareBut anger stole the jewels awayAnd love has left you bare,Made you cry...These tears of pearlsWell I could be the tired jokerPour my heart to get you inSacrifice my happinessJust so I could winMaybe cry...These tears of pearlsChorus:All these mixed emotionsWe keep locked away like stolen pearlsStolen pearl devotionsWe keep locked away from all the worldWe twist and turn where angels burnLike fallen soldiers, we will learnThat once forgotten, twice removedLove will be the death,the death of you...Baby!C'mon darlin'Mm, mm, mm, mm... Yeah...Chorus:All these mixed emotionsWe keep locked away like stolen pearlsStolen pearl devotionsWe keep locked away from all the worldAll these mixed emotionsWe keep locked away like stolen pearlsStolen pearl devotionsWe keep locked away from all the world
