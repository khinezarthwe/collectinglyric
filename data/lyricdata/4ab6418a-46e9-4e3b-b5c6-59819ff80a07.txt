Looking through my window shadeStare at streets that bare no nameNow it all looks strange to meYesterday seems like a dreamBut I often try too hardTo break the routine of my dayTurn around see what I seeCan't help wishing it couldChange change againUnchain myself I willSee the faces in the crowdBusy streets they move aroundUnderground seems such a dragWaiting still and then we changeChange change againUnchain myself I willThe more I see the more it hurtsThe more we change it all seems worseTomorrow till tomorrow comesAs it drags me there I feelA sense of urgency unveilWhats in store for us todayRead the papers drift awayChange change againUnchain myself I willOh how I hate to feel this wayThe more I wait to see changeThe more I see the more it hurtsThe more we change it all seems worse
