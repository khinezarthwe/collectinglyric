[Exodus][Intro- Tom Skid]Voices inside my head are making me go madNow I'm afraid to sleep from nightmares that I've hadI feel I'm on the edge, I need some kind of cureNow I've gone and killed someone, I'm mentally disturbed![chorus]They can't keep me locked awayMy psychiatrist says I'm okThey think that they've got me trainedBut I know I'm really deranged!Arrested for murder, my casecomes to trialProsecution's accusing me of things sick and vileI admit I'm guilty, but plead insanitySix months at Bellevue, then I'm walking free[repeat chorus][solo- Gary][solo- Rick]They want to calm me so they feed me thorazineIt doesn't make me calmer, it only makes me meanNow they let me loose, back in societyWith some psychiatric help and a lobotomyBut I've got them fooled, I'm playing at their gameI'm more psycho than before, I don't even know my nameI know they should have killed me when they had the chanceBut the system let me off with a little song and dance!
