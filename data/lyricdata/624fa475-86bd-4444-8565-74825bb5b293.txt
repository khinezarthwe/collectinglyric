Oh, hiyaWatch this! Watch this!We'll suck you inPast its burgundy death grinCrushing boat (rot) cross your facePulling your brains out of your skinWatch this! watch this!Lets have a wander,To poke the matted brick face.I'll show what to think of,Stand behind you, stand behind you just incase!Watch this! watch this!And you can't stop the grins,Dripping off on-top of you.No you you cant stop the coins from spinning, and spinning and spinning.. ..can't stop the coins from spinningI swear this thing will take you in - watch.The gloss is gone to a backwards torch,Cos we're chomping at the bits and they're crushedCos we're running out of time (we're running out of time)We demand yr attention soWatch this! Watch this!1 2 3 4 ,1234I swear this thing will take you in - watch.Now we're back in the grid,Chance to become what we did.(And now we're stuck screaming out)You saw the jaws rattle in a vacuum,You saw the smiles stamped on,You saw them hold you up like a prize in the throbbing gloss of the body.You saw the sky rupture in a heart beatYou saw the rattle of a newbornYou saw these hands as they forced it down, to the slither of an 8 ballScream and shoutTire you outStretch you outThere's no doubt
