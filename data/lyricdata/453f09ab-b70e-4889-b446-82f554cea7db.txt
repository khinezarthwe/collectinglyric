I'm the desperateAnd you're the SaviorI'm the desperateAnd you're the SaviorThere's been somethingSomething else talkin' in my earSomeone save meWhen I speak, it begins to decayI'm not about to bury myselfOh God, my hands are shaking againCalm downCalm DownNow I can't feel the floor and my visionTakes it's toll on meI'm the desperateAnd you're the SaviorI'm the desperateAnd you're the SaviorOh God it's racing through my veinsI'm afraid there must be some kinda mistakeOh I'm in over my head againReach in and grab a hold of meI'm so scared that I've started to slip.They say that I'll never changeI'll prove 'em wrongProve 'em wrongIt's overIt's overI hear the calling but it's passing throughClean me up show me how to liveI hear the calling but it's passing throughClean me up show me how to liveTear me downLet me start again
