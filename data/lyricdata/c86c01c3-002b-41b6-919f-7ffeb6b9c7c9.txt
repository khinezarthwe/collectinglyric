I still get lost, caught in a dazeTongue tied, just like the very first day...I saw you & I'm so amazed'Cause the look that got me twisted still hasn't changed.Your sexy eyes never lieBaby, I lose myself, when they openGirl, forget about goin' outBaby, I'd rather not. So, I'm hopin'.Chorus:I could just Stare At You forever.Oh baby.I could be here with you doin' whatever.My lady.It's not the way you look that brings me to my kneesIt's the way you look at meI could just Stare At You foreverIf forever you were starin' at me.What do you see? I can't figure it outYour talkin' to my heart without makin' a soundI can't lose when I'm caught in your eyesI feel like superman, Got me up in the sky.Your sexy eyes never lieBaby, I lose my ground...Your so gorgeous, oh...Girl, forget about goin' outBaby, I want you now...Chorus:I could just Stare At You forever.Oh baby.I could be here with you doin' whatever.My lady.It's not the way you look that brings me to my kneesIt's the way you look at meI could just Stare At You foreverIf forever you were starin' at me.Baby, keep the lights onI'm gonna Stare At You all night long& we'll keep rockin' 'til the sun shinesWaitin' 'til the moonlight to do it again.Chorus:I could just Stare At You forever.Oh baby.I could be here with you doin' whatever.My lady.It's not the way you look that brings me to my kneesIt's the way you look at meI could just Stare At You foreverIf forever you were starin' at me.[Song ends:][Outro:][Donnie:]You know the name of Daddy's group?Daddy's singing group?You don't know the name?[Donnie's son:]Mm-mm.[Donnie:]The Block?[Donnie's son:]I thought it was all the New Kids On The Block.[Donnie:]That's right.
