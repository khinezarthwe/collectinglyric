I've come to wish you an unhappy birthdayI've come to wish you an unhappy birthdayBecause you're evil and you lieAnd if you should die, I may feel slightly sad but I won't cryLoved and lost and some may sayWhen usually it's nothing, surely you're happy it should be this way?I say no, I'm gonna kill my dogMay the lines sag, the lines sag heavy and deep tonightI've come to wish you an unhappy birthdayI've come to wish you an unhappy birthdayBecause you're evil and you lieAnd if you should die, I may feel slightly sad but I won't cryLoved and lost and some may sayWhen usually it's nothing, surely you're happy it should be this way?I said no and then I shot myselfSo drink, drink, drink and be ill tonightFrom the one you left behindFrom the one you left behindFrom the one you left behindFrom the one you left behindBehind, behind, behindBehind, behind, behindOh, unhappy birthday
