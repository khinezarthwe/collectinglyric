I'm waiting in my cold cell when the bell begins to chimeReflecting on my past life and it doesn't have much timeCos at 5 o'clock they take me to the Gallows PoleThe sands of time for me are running lowWhen the priest comes to read me the last ritesI take a look through the bars at the last sightsOf a world that has gone very wrong for meCan it be there's some sort of errorHard to stop the surmounting terrorIs it really the end not some crazy dreamSomebody please tell me that I'm dreamingIt's not so easy to stop from screamingBut words escape me when I try to speakTears they flow but why am I cryingAfter all I am not afraid of dyingDon't believe that there is never an endAs the guards march me out to the courtyardSomeone calls from a cell "God be with you"If there's a God then why has he let me die?As I walk all my life drifts before meAnd though the end is near I'm not sorryCatch my soul cos it's willing to fly awayMark my words please believe my soul lives onPlease don't worry now that I have goneI've gone beyond to see the truthWhen you know that your time is close at handMaybe then you'll begin to understandLife down there is just a strange illusion
