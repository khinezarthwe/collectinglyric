Can I stay at you house?I'll sleep on the floor,My home is war zone,I've no stomach for more,You can't hold a candle,To what I saw today,More than I can handle,So I'm running away.And those home fires burn,Scorching a hole through me,And I am welcome no more.It's the harrowing story,Of one man's mistake,And the names have been left out,For the innocents sake,That man who would save us,From the hurt the world brings,Neglected to mention,Who would save us from him?And those home fires burn,Scorching a hole through me,It's like the third degree,And I am welcome no more.Now I've no one to turn to,I guess I'm at my wits end,I'm beginning to learn who,Are really my friends.And those home fires burn,Scorching a hole through me,It's like the third degree,And I am welcome no more.Home fires burn,Scorching a hole through me,It's like the third degree,And I am welcome no more.
