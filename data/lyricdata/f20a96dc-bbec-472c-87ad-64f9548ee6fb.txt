I can't imagine how you feel, and this is how you feelYou say your name like you're no longer convincedBut now they're strapping you in, and closing the lidAnd they're dropping you in, what's done you didThe bell's picking up speed, there's water leaking inThat old equilibrium just starts to spin and spinDo you like to be judged or liked?Do you like it inside a barrelAnd plunging over the falls?Curious and grimWe wrestle at the rimWe wonder all about himAnd the point of it allI'll be short and brief and to the pointThe fighting has resumedIn that tone of voiceThe plague is exhumedHe said, "What I'm going throughIs essentially all trueMade no less amazing by the fact that it's see through"Do you like to be judged or liked?Do you like it inside a barrelAnd plunging over the falls?Strong and green and dimIt wrestled him like nothingOut, out, out and in-To the thrill of them allAnd the real wonder of the worldIs that we don't jump tooAnd the real wonder of the worldIs that we don't jump tooAnd the real wonder of the worldIs that we don't jump too
