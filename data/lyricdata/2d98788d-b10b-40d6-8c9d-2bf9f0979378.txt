Flocking to the seaCrowds of people wait for meSea gulls scavengeSteal ice creamWorries vanishWithin my dreamI left my soul thereDown by the seaI lost control hereLiving freeI left my soul thereDown by the seaI lost control hereLiving freeFishing boats sail past the shoreNo singing may-day any moreThe sun is shiningThe Water's clearJust you and I walk along the pierI left my soul thereDown by the seaI lost control hereLiving freeI left my soul thereDown by the seaI lost control hereLiving freeA cool breeze flows but mind the waspSome get stung it's worth the costI'd love to stayThe city calls me homeMore hassles fuss and lies on the phoneI left my soul thereDown by the seaI lost control hereLiving freeI left my soul thereDown by the seaI lost control hereLiving freeI left my soul thereDown by the seaI lost control hereLiving freeI left my soul thereDown by the seaI lost control with youAnd living, livingAnd I, living, by the sea
