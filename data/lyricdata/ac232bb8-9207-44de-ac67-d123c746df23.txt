I see you come out of a strobe, you come out of a strobeWe stop and try to catch some breath, we try to catch some breathI lost it, I can't remember thatWe mean well but it never does (one two three four)And after all this time who would've thought I'd meet you here?And after all this time who would've thought I'd meet you here?I heard you got somebody new, you got somebody newBut what made you think of coming back? You got me coming backI held you, I can remember thatThe walk home, we stood out in the coldAnd after all this time who would've thought I'd meet you here?And after all this time who would've thought I'd meet you here?And you melt white snow before you let me knowAnd after all this time who would've thought I'd meet you here?
