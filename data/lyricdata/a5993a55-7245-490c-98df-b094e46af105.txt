I reach and I reach for youIt's so surrealAnd I'm not sureI breathe each breath for youNow I'm afraidWhat can I doClose my eyes and it will go awayClose my eyes and it will goI seeYet I'm blindI'm not aloneWhat can I sayI feelYet I'm numbI'm so immuneI bleed for youClose my eyes and it will go awayLook inside - what do you seeDefine your own realityClose my eyes and it will goIllusion, so confusingDreamingNo conclusionSoothe yourSoothe your aching mindI reachAnd I reach down underIn the dreamIt pulls me underI reach for you
