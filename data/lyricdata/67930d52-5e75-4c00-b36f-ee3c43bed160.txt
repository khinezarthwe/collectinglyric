At my feeding timeShe pushed food through the doorAnd I crawl towards the crack of lightSometimes I can't find my wayNewspapers spread around soaking all that they canA cleaning is due again, a good hosing downThe lady whom I feel maternal love forCan not look me in the eyesBut I see hers and they are blueAnd they cock and twitch and masturbateAahhhhI said soI said soI said soNirvanaNirvanaNirvanaNirvanaNirvanaNirvanaBlack windows of paint I scratched with my nailsI see others just like me, why do they not try to escape?They bring out the older ones, they point in my wayThey come with a flash of light and take my family awayAnd very later I have learned toAccept some friends or ridiculeMy whole existence is for your amusementAnd that is why I'm here with youTo takeMe withYou're rightNirvanaNirvanaNirvanaNirvanaNirvanaNirvanaNirvanaNirvana
