Mary belongs to the words of a songI try to be strong for her, try not to be wrong for herBut she will not wait for me, anymore, anymoreWhy did I say all those things before? I was sure(She is the one), but I have a purpose(She is the one), and I have to fight this(She is the one), a villain I can't knock downI see your face with every punch I takeAnd every bone I break, it's all for youAnd my worst pains are words I cannot sayStill I will always fight on for youMary's alive in the bright New York sky,The city lights shine for her, above them I cry for herEverything's small on the ground below, down belowWhat if I fall, then where would I go, would she know?(She is the one), all that I wanted(She is the one), and I will be haunted(She is the one), this gift is my curse for nowI see your face with every punch I takeAnd every bone I break, it's all for youAnd my worst pains are words I cannot sayStill I will always fight on for youI see your face with every punch I takeAnd every bone I break, it's all for youAnd my worst pains are words I cannot sayStill I will always fight on for youFight on for you, fight on for you
