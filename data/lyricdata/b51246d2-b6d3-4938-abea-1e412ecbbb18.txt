Nobody on the road, nobody on the beachI feel it in the air, the summer's out of reachEmpty lake, empty streets, the sun goes down aloneI'm driving by your house, though I know you're not homeBut I can see you, your brown skin shinin' in the sunYou got your hair combed back and your sunglasses on, babyI can tell you my love for you will still be strongAfter the boys of summer have goneI never will forget those nights, I wonder if it was a dreamRemember how you made me crazy, remember how I made you screamNow I don't understand what happened to our loveBut babe, I'm gonna get you back, I'm gonna show you what I'm made ofI can see you, your brown skin shinin' in the sunI see you walkin' real slow, and smilin' at everyoneI can tell you my love for you will still be strongAfter the boys of summer have goneOut on the road today, I saw a Deadhead sticker on a CadillacA little voice inside my head said, "don't look back, you can never look back"I thought I knew what love was, what did I know?Those days are gone forever, I should just let them go, butI can see you, your brown skin shinin' in the sunYou got the top pulled down and the radio on, babyI can tell you my love for you will still be strongAfter the boys of summer have goneI can see you, your brown skin shinin' in the sunYou got that hair slicked back and those Wayfarers on, babyI can tell you my love for you will still be strongAfter the boys of summer have gone
