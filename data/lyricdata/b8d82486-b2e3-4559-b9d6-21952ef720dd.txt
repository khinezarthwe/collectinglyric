I know the sugar plum fairy her name is MaryShe's up inside my arm, halfway does great half harmSo she charmed herself into a toilet and fucked herself gold holySilver beads shot out her eyesWhen the rain comesWhen the rain comesBut then it got worseI know you wellI wear your smellNailed at the hipsI, I see you are me1 2 3 4 5Glad you're not alive6 7 8 9 10Back to hell againThis sick charadeThis ditch I've spadeI've come to playI, I see you are me1 2 3 4 5Glad you're not alive6 7 8 9 10Back to hell againCatatonic planetI won't have it!
