We can fight our desiresOoh, but when we start making firesWe get ever so hotOoh, whether we like it or notThey say we can love who we trustOoh, but what is love without lust?Two hearts with accurate devotionsOoh, but what are feelings without emotions?I'm going in for the killI'm doing it for a thrillOh I'm hoping you'll understandAnd not let go of my handI'm going in for the killI'm doing it for a thrillOh I'm hoping you'll understandAnd not let go of my handI hang my hopes out on the lineOoh, will they be ready for you in time?If you leave them out too longOoh, they'll be withered by the sunFull stops and exclamation marksOoh, my words stumble before I startHow far can you send emotions?Ooh, can this bridge cross the ocean?I'm going in for the killI'm doing it for a thrillOh I'm hoping you'll understandAnd not let go of my handI'm going in for the killI'm doing it for a thrillOh I'm hoping you'll understandAnd not let go of my handLet's go to war to make peaceLet's be cold to create heatI hope in darkness we can seeAnd you're not blinded by the light from meI'm going in for the killI'm doing it for a thrillOh I'm hoping you'll understandAnd not let go of my hand
