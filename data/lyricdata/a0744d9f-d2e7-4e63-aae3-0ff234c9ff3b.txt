Nobody likes youEveryone left youThey're all out without youHaving funWhere have all the bastards gone?The underbelly stacks up ten highThe dummy failed the crash test, collecting unemployment checksA flunky only along for the rideWhere have all the riots gone?As this city's motto gets pulverized"Once in love, is now in debt" on your birth certificateSo strike the fucking match to light this fuseThe town bishop's an extortionistAnd he don't even know that you existStanding still when it's do or dieYou'd better run for your fucking lifeIt's not over 'til you're undergroundIt's not over before it's too lateThis city's burning, it's not my burdenIt's not over before it's too lateThere is nothing left to analyzeWhere will all the martyrs go when the virus cures itself?And where will we all go when it's too late?And don't look back...You're not the Jesus of SuburbiaThe St. Jimmy is a figment ofYour father's rage and your mother's loveMade me the idiot AmericaIt's not over 'til you're undergroundIt's not over before it's too lateThis city's burning, it's not my burdenIt's not over before it's too lateWell, she said "I can't take this placeI'm leaving it behind"Well, she said "I can't take this townI'm leaving you tonight"
