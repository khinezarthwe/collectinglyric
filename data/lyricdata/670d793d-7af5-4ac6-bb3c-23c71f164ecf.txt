Sweat drips in my eyesScreams of lust we cryTonight you are everythingYou're everything...You're everything to me no moreAs I wake from this perfect dreamI'll escape from Eden's wallsCan I not stay and live this lie?Go away and I'll think only of myselfAnd to think that you would not be scared or surprised if I'd severed all these tiesthis is the end...I'll lose myself in anguish for tonightHelp me get over youI feel so numb to see this bitter end of beautiful illusions...would this be the same?Broken pieces will not mend to save our past now...go away...I'll lose myself in anguish for tonightHelp me get over youOne last false apologyHelp me get over youNow we must let goUrgency overwhelms me as I must restrain my flood of tearsI refuse to be slave to your false beauty againI'll lose myself in anguish for tonightHelp me get over youOne last false apologyHelp me get over youIn my mind Blood drips from your eyesa beautiful last goodbye
