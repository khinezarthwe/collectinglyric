Pay your respects to a greater intellectYou're just a pawn, does this confession turn you on?I know your kind, you'd do me from behindAnd when everybody stares, their eyes will bare the sharpest glareEverybody knows beneath your clothesStarring at your toes is just a poseEverybody good knows how hard you blowEverybody knowsYou did me wrong, I grinned and played alongThose days are gone, does this confession turn you on?I'd see you stoned, lawn chair to gilded throneYou cut your tiny ties and now you're dangling by a lieEverybody knows beneath your clothesStarring at your toes is just a poseEverybody good knows how hard you blowEverybody knowsYou think you're Jesus ChristYou're not my Jesus Christ
