I wanted to take a train to the nearest awakeningTook a bullet the speed of light, into infinite timeI noticed a wake, the face was mineWhere was I?I wanted to take a break at the next gatheringMade a change to white and light to the snap on my behindI noticed a face, the mother was mineWhere was I?I wanted to kick dust on the road I'm travelingRaking time in my mind like leaves, weaved in suffer and cryI noticed your face, I was looking at mineWhere was I?I wanted to ask someone but who's listeningMistake in the belief that all I see is with my eyesI noticed no one could see my face and I knew that I was flying.-in an instant-I knew were I was again.I was taking another train to the nearest awakening...
