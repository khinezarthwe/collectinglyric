Show me moonlight on the sunriseI've seen so many planets dancingI've seen too many people hidingShow me sunset and I won't forgetThat I am one of two planets dancingI am part of two planets dancingShallow man!Sign your nameOn my sun!The song of SolomonDied in the battlegroundThe song of SolomonDied in love's battlegroundI am fullShattered by this sinning timeFor all your suffering by nightOh warm, but under brightAnd life is so much dark and lightDay cannot exist without a nightAnd you are not separate from meI am a heart that's full of lifeAnd to be sharedOn this nightFeel my handsFeel my lifeFor the SunAnd the starsAre my MotherAnd my sisterI know where the form is changingI know that the stars will follow me..
