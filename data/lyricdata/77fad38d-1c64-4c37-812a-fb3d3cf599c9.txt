Crimson flames tied through my yearsFlowing high and mighty trappedCountless fire and flaming roadsUsing ideas as my maps"We'll meet on edges soon", said IProud 'neath heated browAh, but I was so much older thenI'm younger than that nowHalf-wracked prejudice leaped forth"Rip down all hate", I screamedLies that life is black and whiteSpoke from my skull, I dreamedRomantic flanks of musketeersFoundationed deep, somehowAh, but I was so much older thenI'm younger than that nowIn a soldier's stance I aimed my handAt the mongrel dogs who teachFearing not I'd become my enemyIn the instant that I preachSisters fled by confusion boatsMutiny from stern to bowAh, but I was so much older thenI'm younger than that nowAh, but I was so much older thenI'm younger than that nowMy guard stood hard when abstract threatsToo noble to neglectDeceived me into thinkingI had something to protectGood and bad, I define these termsQuite clear, no doubt, somehowAh, but I was so much older thenI'm younger than that now
