One murder coming onSay I'm wrong for all I've doneAre you god to judge us all?Prophet false with a jury hungHome, an empty shell of a living hellA human zoo full of cannibalsBackwards life, it's a dirty worldWhere your dreams can't be heardA shallow grave is where I dwellBuried alive within this cellA shadow cast upon my fateDeliver me to the one who waitsGuilt, regret and innocenceFull of lies and corruptionSuffocate while the worms infestUnderground, take one last breathHome, an empty shell of a living hellA human zoo full of cannibalsBackwards life, it's a dirty worldWhere your dreams can't be heardA shallow grave is where I dwellBuried alive within this cellA shadow cast upon my fateDeliver me to the one who waitsVisions of life start to flashAs the dirt rains downHow does your so-called GodGet off on thisBlackness descending on meIn this hole in the groundNo longer will I see the light of dayThe saints are gonna make the sinner payAnd maggots are waiting to feast on my flesh
