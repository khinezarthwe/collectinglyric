It's overLook out belowAnd I'm wastedI still taste itYeah it's so hard to let goSo breathe in nowAnd breathe it outThe forecastA car crashIt's looking like another...Breakdown, reboundThis could be my last goodbyeYou cross your heart, I hope to dieAnd I can't deny your eyesYou know I try to read between the linesI saw a warning signAnd then you threw me up against the wallWho said that it's better to have loved and lost?I wish that I had never loved at allNo rewindsNo second timesAnd I won't breakI won't waste, everything you left behindSo don't followJust let it goThe weather's, been betterDon't let it be another...Breakdown, reboundThis could be my last goodbyeYou cross your heart, I hope to dieAnd I can't deny your eyesYou know I try to read between the linesI saw a warning signAnd then you threw me up against the wallWho said that it's better to have loved and lost?I wish that I had never loved at allAll the nights you spent sitting nowhere out there on your ownAll the nights I waited by the phone when you were going in aloneAnd all your different faces and all your different ways are making everything a messAnd all I'm saying is that all your different places and all the complications led to thisAnd I can't deny your eyesYou know I try to read between the linesI saw a warning signAnd then you threw me up against the wallWho said that it's better to have loved and lost?I wish that I had never lovedAnd I can't deny your eyesYou know I try to read between the linesI saw a warning signAnd then you threw me up against the wallWho said that it's better to have loved and lost?I wish that I had never loved at all(Never loved at all)
