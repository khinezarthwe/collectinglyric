Snap away she saidAs they danced towards the moonlightRun away he didAs she cast off another nightSo in tune were weBy the thought of what could never beSo consumed were weBy feelings felt between the sheetsWhat do they meanSeamless dirty dreamsWhy must you screamPlease don't make a sceneShe thinks, she playsIs it all a game?No need to be tameSugar melts the acid rainI saw you wading in the waterI saw you ride along the seaShine on a nightmareShine through the treesAhhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhhh x4()
