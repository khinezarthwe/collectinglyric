Can we make this last foreverWith every word we're growing distantAnd I feel as though I have to let you goIt's growing old to see us torn by every choice that I have madeIn every instant you were right to write me off and move aheadAnd I think I let you down, I throw it all awayI never meant to break it up or make you feel this wayIt's getting colder through these walls that seem to thin to break us nowA perfect ending's still in line though it seems our time is running outTrace the call from you, we'll make this go awayI never felt this day would come, I'll never be the sameCan we make this last foreverWith every word you're growing distantAnd I feel as though I have to let you goCan we make this time togetherSeem as though we never startedAnd it's hard to be the only one to knowThrough open eyes I sense a feeling painted black that lines your heartIt's bleeding through just like the colors that I've seen right from the startAnd if I had the choice to do this all againWould you be inclined to notice it or would just pretendCan we make this last foreverWith every word you're growing distantAnd I feel as though I have to let you goCan we make this time togetherSeem as though we never startedAnd it's hard to be the only one to knowRemember how we used to be(How we used to be)Remember how we used to be(How we used to be)Can we make this last foreverWith every word you're growing distantAnd I feel as though I have to let you goCan we make this time togetherSeem as though we never startedAnd it's hard to be the only one to knowCan we make this last foreverWith every word you're growing distantAnd I feel as though I have to let you goCan we make this time togetherSeem as though we never startedAnd it's hard to be the only one to know
