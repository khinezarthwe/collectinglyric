The sky was blond like her, it was a dayTo take the child out back and shoot itI could have buried all my deadUp in her cemetery, headShe had dirty word witchcraftI was in the deep end of her skinThen it seemed like a one car wreckBut I knew it was a horrid tragedyWays to make the tiny satisfaction disappearBlow out the candlesIn on all my FrankensteinsAt least my death wish will come trueTaste like Valentine'sAnd we cry, you're like a birthdayI should have picked the photographIt lasted longer than youPutting holes in happinessWe'll paint the future black if it needs any color.Death sentence is now a storyWho'll be digging when you finally let me die?The romance of our assassinationIf you're Bonnie, I'll be your ClydeBut the grass is greener hereAnd I can see all of your snakesYou wear your ruins wellPlease run away with me to hellBlow out the candlesIn on all my FrankensteinsAt least my death wish will come trueTaste like Valentine'sAnd we cry, you're like a birthdayI should have picked the photographIt lasted longer than youBlow out the candlesIn on all my FrankensteinsAt least my death wish will come trueTaste like Valentine'sAnd we cry, you're like a birthdayI should have picked the photographIt lasted longer than youBlow out the candlesIn on all my FrankensteinsAt least my death wish will come trueTaste like Valentine'sAnd we cry, you're like a birthdayI should have picked the photographIt lasted longer than you
