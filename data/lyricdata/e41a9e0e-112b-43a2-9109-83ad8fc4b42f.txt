The light still in our eyesWe're leaving this whole fairground behindIt's a dream that's growing coldThe circus never diesThe act forever haunts these skiesI know we cannot stayFarewell to the fairgroundThese rides aren't working anymoreGoodbye to this dead townUntil the ice begins to thawThis place used to gleamI see it in my hopeful dreamsNow I have to get awayWe move towards the starsAnd all that we touch becomes oursLet's keep warm 'til it's dayFarewell to the fairgroundThese rides aren't working anymoreGoodbye to this dead townUntil the ice begins to thawWe'll head south, just hold my hand nowI feel like I'm casting off my clothesAnd I'm running through the snow towards the sunsetAnd I'm always with youKeep on runningKeep, keep on runningThere's no place like homeThere's no place like homeKeep on runningKeep, keep on runningThere's no place like homeThere's no place like homeKeep on runningKeep, keep on runningThere's no place like homeThere's no place like homeKeep on runningKeep, keep on runningThere's no place like homeThere's no place like homeKeep on runningKeep, keep on runningThere's no place like homeThere's no place like homeKeep on runningKeep, keep on runningThere's no place like homeThere's no place like homeFarewell to the fairgroundThese rides aren't working anymoreGoodbye to this dead townUntil the ice begins to thawWe'll head south, just hold my hand nowI feel like I'm casting off my clothesAnd I'm running through the snow towards the sunsetAnd I'm always with you
