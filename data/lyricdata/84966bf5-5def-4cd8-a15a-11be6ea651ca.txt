Falling in your, falling in your in your armsFish on a line, learns to live on dry landThrown back again to drownKinder with poisonThen pushed down the well or a face burnt to hellFeel the cruel stones breaking her bonesDead before bornWords fall in ruins -- but no soundShe's dying of your shame -- she's maimed by your painHe gives birth to swimming horsesFish on a line, walking on dry landBut back in the water to drown -- we drownFloating in skyHe gives birth to swimming horsesTake a ride on the tide with the assassin at your sidethe weightlessness under water -- forgets in slow motionAnd watches pointless torturesHe gives birth to swimming horsesFloating in sky like fishes can fly through your arms
