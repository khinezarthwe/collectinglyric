Hush now, don't you cryWipe away the teardrop from your eyeYou're lying safe in bedIt was all a bad dream spinning in your headYour mind tricked you to feel the painOf someone close to you leaving the game of lifeSo here it is, another chanceWide awake you face the dayYour dream is overOr has it just begun?There's a place I like to hideA doorway that I run through in the nightRelax child, you were thereBut only didn't realize and you were scaredIt's a place where you will learnTo face your fears, retrace the yearsAnd ride the whims of your mindCommanding in another worldSuddenly you hear and seeThis magic new dimensionI will be watching over youI am gonna help you see it throughI will protect you in the nightI am smiling next to you in silent lucidityIf you open your mind for meYou won't rely on open eyes to seeThe walls you built withinCome tumbling down and a new world will beginLiving twice at once, you learnYou're safe from the pain in the dream domainA soul set free to flyA round trip journey in your headMaster of illusion, can you realizeYour dream's aliveYou can be the guide butI will be watching over youI am gonna help you see it throughI will protect you in the nightI am smiling next to you
