I'm not part of your eliteI'm just alrightClass structure waving colorsBleeding from my throatNot subserviant to you I'm just alrightDown classed by the powers that beGive me loss of hopeCast out... Buried in a holeStruck down... forcing me to fallDestroyed... giving up the fightI know I'm not alrightWhat's my price and will you pay itIf it's alright?Take it from my dignityWaste it until it's deadThrow me back into the gutter'Cause it's alrightFind another pleasure fuckerDrag them down to hellCast out... Buried in a holeStruck down... forcing me to fallDestroyed... giving up the fightI know I'm not alrightCast out... Buried in a holeStruck down... forcing me to fallDestroyed... giving up the fightI know I'm not alright
