Debonair lullabiesIn melodies revealedIn deep despair on lonely nightsHe knows just how you feelThe slyest rhymes, the sharpest suitsIn miracles made realLike a bird in flight on a hot sweet nightYou know you're right just to hold her tightHe soothes it right, makes it out of sightAnd everything's good in the world tonightWhen Smokey sings, I hear violinsWhen Smokey sings, I forget everythingAs she's packing her thingsAs she's spreading her wingsThe front door might slamBut the back door it ringsAnd Smokey sings, he singsElegance in eloquenceFor sale or rent or hireShould I say yes and match his bestThen I would be a liarSymphonies that soothe the rageWhen lovers' hearts catch fireLike a bird in flight on a hot sweet nightYou know you're right just to hold her tightHe soothes it right, makes it out of sightAnd everything's good in the world tonightWhen Smokey sings, I hear violinsWhen Smokey sings, I forget everythingAs she's packing her thingsAs she's spreading her wingsSmashing the hellWith the heaven she bringsThen Smokey sings, he sings(Would it be true to say)Luther croonsSly's the original originatorJames screamsMarvin was the only innovatorBut nothing can compareNothing can compareWhen Smokey singsWhen Smokey sings, I hear violinsWhen Smokey sings, I forget everythingAs she's packing her thingsAs she's spreading her wingsShe threw back the ringWhen Smokey singsSmokey singsSmokey sings
