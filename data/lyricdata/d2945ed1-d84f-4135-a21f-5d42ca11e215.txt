I know a girl who's lost and lonelySits by the phone on her ownBut the phone don't ringAnd the birds don't sing in her treeShe lost herself in a haze of pityAnd doesn't know where to runShe's a headshrinker nowAnd I think it's time we had some funLost in a fog, I've been treated like a dogAnd I'm outta hereI got no name and I feel no shameAnd I've got no fearAnd I bow down to the tears of a clownWhatever's going down is comin' aroundI hope you don't regret todayFor the rest of your livesFor the rest of your livesFor the rest of your livesFor the rest of your livesLost in a fog, I've been treated like a dogAnd I'm outta hereI got no name and I feel no shameAnd I've got no fearAnd I bow down to the tears of a clownWhatever's going down is comin' aroundI hope you don't regret todayFor the rest of your livesI know a girl who's lost and lonelySits by the phone on her ownBut the phone don't ringAnd the birds don't sing in her treeShe lost herself in a haze of pityAnd doesn't know where to runShe's a headshrinker nowAnd I think it's time we had some funLost in a fog, I've been treated like a dogAnd I'm outta hereI got no name and I feel no shameAnd I've got no fearAnd I bow down to the tears of a clownWhatever's going down is comin' aroundI hope you don't regret todayFor the rest of your livesFor the rest of your livesFor the rest of your livesFor the rest of your lives
