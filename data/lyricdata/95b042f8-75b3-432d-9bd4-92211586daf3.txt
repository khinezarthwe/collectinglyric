Memories are just where you laid themDrag the waters 'till the depths give up their deadWhat did you expect to find?Was there something you left behind?Don't you remember anything I said when I saidDon't fall away, and leave me to myselfDon't fall away and leave love bleedingIn my hands, in my hands againLeave love bleedingIn my hands, in my handsLove lies bleedingOh hold me now I feel contagiousAm I the only place that you've left to goShe cries her life is likeSome movie black and whiteDead actors faking linesOver and over and over again she criesDon't fall away, and leave me to myselfDon't fall away, and leave love bleedingIn my hands, in my hands againLeave love bleedingIn my hands, in my handsLove lies bleedingAnd I wantedYou turned awayYou don't remember, but I doYou never even triedDon't fall away and leave me to myselfDon't fall away and leave love bleedingIn my hands, in my hands againLeave love bleedingIn my hands, in my handsLove lies bleeding
