The singer finished singingAnd she's walking outThe singer sheds a tear, fear of falling outAnd it's hard to say how I feel todayFor years gone by and I criedIt's hard to say that I was wrongIts hard to say that I miss youSince you've been gone, it's not the sameMy worries weigh the worldHow I used to be and everything (I'm cold)Seems a plague in meAnd it's hard to say how I feel todayFor years gone by, and I cried...It's hard to say that I was wrongIts hard to say that I miss youSince you've been gone, it's not the sameIt's hard to say I held my tongueIt's hard to say if onlySince you've been gone, it's not the sameWorse than the fear it's the lie you told a thousand times before.Worse than a fear, it's the knife.And it's hard to say how I feel today.For years gone by, and I cried...It's hard to say that I was wrongIts hard to say that I miss youSince you've been gone, it's not the sameIt's hard to say I held my tongueIt's hard to say if onlySince you've been gone, it's not the same
