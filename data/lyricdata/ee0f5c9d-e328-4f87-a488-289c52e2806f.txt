You gotta hope for the best and the best looks good now babyand I don't think a few words of sympathy will make your world go roundI'm sitting here looking at the TV burning holes in everything that I getYou'd better come right down and do it all over again.You'd better come right down and do it all over again.You'd better come right down and do it all over again.I love you like I love the sun in the morningBut I don't think a few words of mine are gonna make you change your mindI'm gonna spend the day in bed and I'm planning on sleeping my life awayYou'd better come right down and do it all over again.You'd better come right down and do it all over again.You'd better come right down and do it all over again.You've gotta hope for the best and the best looks great now babyand I don't think a few words of mine are gonna make your world go roundI'm sitting here looking at the TV burning holes in everything that I getYou'd better come right down and do it all over again.You'd better come right down and do it all over again.You'd better come right down and do it all over again.You'd better come right down and do it all over again.You'd better come right down and do it all over again.
