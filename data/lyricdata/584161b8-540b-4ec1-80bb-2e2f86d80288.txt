Summer dream, summer blueYou're gonna wait, I heard the newsBut you hurt people and I disapproveDestiny is not for us to chooseI got a little money saved up in the bankBut right about now I'm sleeping in my carHot nights in the backseatPlaying my guitarSummer dream, summer blueI can't rendezvous with youAt your new place with a viewI'm stuck here in the coffee roomI would get away if I couldBut I don't like to travel farTryin' to make it here in HollywoodSaving up for new guitarSummer dream, summer blueSummer dream, summer blueSummer dream, summer blueSummer dream, summer blue
