When your sparkle evades your soulI'll be at your side to consoleWhen you're standing on the window ledgeI'll talk you back, back from the edgeI will turn, I will turn your tideBe your shepherd, I swear, be your guideWhen you're lost in your deep and darkest place aroundMay my words walk with you home safe and soundWhen you say that I'm no good and you feel like walkingI need to make sure you know it's just the prescription talkingWhen your feet decide to walk you on the wayward sideClimbing up upon the stairs and down the downward slideI will turn, I will turn your tideDo all that I can to heal you insideI will be the angel on your shoulderMy name is Geraldine, I'm your social workerI see youNeed meI know you doI see youNeed meI know you doI know you doI will turn, I will turn your tideDo all that I can to heal you insideI will be the angel on your shoulderMy name is Geraldine, I'm your social worker
