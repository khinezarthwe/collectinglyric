Too long in the same place, I'm sinking into this townI've charmed the same old snakes, I think we've gotta get outBefore I break away from me. this place is my lobotomyImagine we were dead counting all the things we never did...I remember when you told me I should live like I'm dyingNot to close my eyes while everything burnsWhat are we waiting for?These years are dying slowlyToday is still in front of us and we're breaking outToday is now or neverI can't contemplate the Earth all while my head's in the sandCuz I've been buried alive... So take my bleeding handsAnd breathe life into me, right now I'm suffocatingImagine we were dead counting all the things we never did...I don't want a life of agony, I won't be another tragedyAnd close my eyes while everything burnsI won't pretend I don't exist, invisible until I turn to dust...Open your eyes, we're still aliveStanding still is criminal and never lasts foreverThe safest place in life is now, today's the day we're breaking outI remember when you told me I should live like I'm dyingAnd not to close my eyes while everything burns...
