Lost in a lullabySide of the roadMelt in a memorySlide in a solitudeNot till I can read by the moonAm I going anywhereNot till I can read by the moonI blow you a kissIt should reach you tomorrowAs it flies from the other side of the worldFrom my room in my fugitive motelSomewhere in the dust bowlIt flies from the other side of the world"I'm tired," I said."You always look tired," she said."I'm admired," I said."You always look tired," she said.Not till I can read by the moonAm I going anywhereNot till I can read by the moonI blow you a kissIt should reach you tomorrow, reach you tomorrowIt flies from the other side of the worldFrom my room in my fugitive motelSomewhere in the dust bowl, somewhere in the dust bowlIt flies from the other side of the worldCurtains stay closedBut everyone knowsYou hear through the walls in this placeCigarette holes for every lost soulTo give up the ghost in this placeGive me strengthGive me wingsI blow you a kissIt should reach you tomorrow, reach you tomorrowIt flies from the other side of the worldFrom my room in my fugitive motelSomewhere in the dust bowl, somewhere in the dust bowlIt flies from the other side of the world
