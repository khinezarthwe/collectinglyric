I can give a hundred million reasonsTo build a barricadeI blame it on the changing of the seasonsThe thoughts that I've conveyedDoes it make it all right?It doesn't make it all rightTo roll it over my soulAnd leave me hereRoll it over my soulAnd leave me hereLook around at all the plastic peopleWho live without a careTry to sit with me around my tableBut never bring a chairDoes it make it all right?It doesn't make it all rightTo roll it over my soulAnd leave me hereRoll it over my soulAnd leave me hereTo roll it over my soulAnd leave me hereRoll it over my soulAnd leave me hereTo roll it over my soulAnd leave me hereRoll it over my soulAnd leave me here
