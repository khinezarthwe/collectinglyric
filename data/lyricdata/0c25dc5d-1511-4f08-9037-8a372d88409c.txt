I was always going to fall asleep early tonightI was always going to fall asleep early tonightI was all white-washed and woven and there by your sideI was always going to fall asleep early tonightHell no body falls not when my hand is laid on my heartAt least now when I’m sleeping, I still feel like I’m doing my partI was all kiss curls and cows licks, got angel delightI was all kiss curls and cows licks, got angel delightThen I grew out of the kiss curls and cows lick, got a hairy backThen I grew out of the kiss curls and cows lick, growing twenty fiveI was always going to fall asleep early tonightHell no body falls not when my hand is laid on my heartAt least now when I’m sleeping, I still feel like I’m doing my partI was always going to fall asleep early tonight
