Hold me in your arms may they keep meSing me a lullaby cos I'm sleepyI'm scared you don't need me anymoreBring me to the light of the morningAnd take me through this night till the dawningOh I see a warning in your eyesAnd I don't need no Valentines no noDon't need no rosesCos they just take me back in time no noNow you're not hereHold me just tonight sleep will tend meSave me from lonely hours there's so manyAnd I won't get any sleep tonightAnd I don't need no Valentines no noDon't need no rosesThey just take me back in time no noNow you're not here anymoreNot anymoreAnd I don't need no Valentines no noDon't need no rosesCos they just take me back in time no noTo when you loved me onlyAnd I won't drink no aged wine no noNow you're not here anymoreNot anymoreNot anymoreNot anymore
