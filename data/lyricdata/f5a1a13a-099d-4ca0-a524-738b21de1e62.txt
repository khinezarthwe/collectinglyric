Should I offer up my handAnd save a wish for onceFor all of usAnd should I offer up my handAnd lay the guilt on myselfSo it's easier , to not stay, to not stayBecause I found you in your cornerI pulled you out of the cloudsYou left in such a hurryYour face got lost in the crowdShould I open up my eye's or just ignore who you areAnd what you could have beenAnd should I open up my eye's and make believe you will changeSo it's easier to not stay, to not stayBecause I found you in your cornerI pulled you out of the cloudsYou left in such a hurryYour face got lost in the crowd(x3)Your face is lost in the crowd(x2)
