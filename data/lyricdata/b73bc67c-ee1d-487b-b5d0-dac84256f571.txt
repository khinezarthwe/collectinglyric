I've tripped to the other sideI've fell in to wish the other sideDon't know if you can read my mindBut I think not,I'll throw itOh I think I, I mindI don't mean to be so shyBut I don't know what to do this timeIt could be lost it could be aliveAs you walk awayI think I'll stayMight not be the one for meBut I'm thinkin' oh so constantlyMight be rightYou might be wrongYou're my temptation, you're my perfectionBut you don't understand(Might not be the one, for me)Let's try it anywayI won't walk away
