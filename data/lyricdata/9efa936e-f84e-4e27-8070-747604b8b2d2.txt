Over and over, I keep wondering whyThen I give up and see that look in your eyes'Cause if I trip and fall, I'll be to blameAnd if I hit the wall, I'll still be the sameWasting your time with your so-called friendsThe ones you adore and the ones you pretendAnd it's kind of sad and derangedBut it's not so bad that it can't be explained'Cause in my mindIt's all a waste of timeAnd there's no excuse at allThen I realizeSurprise, you were right all alongAnd I want to knowHave I gone too farHave I sunk to a brand new lowAnd I want to knowIf I've gone too far'Cause I've lost all my self controlGuilty as charged, I've been convicted and triedWas it too much to ask for you to take my side'Cause there's nothing here to defendWhen it's always me that you blame in the end'Cause in my mindIt's the perfect crimeAnd there's no excuse at allThen I realizeSurprise, you were right all alongAnd I want to knowHave I gone too farHave I sunk to a brand new lowAnd I want to knowIf I've gone too far'Cause I've lost all my self controlNothing is what it seems to meWe're sleeping without the dreamsWithout you, nothing defines meWhen I'm slipping away, it's only you that can find meAnd I'm over my head, again I'm fallingFrom end to endAnd I want to knowHave I gone too farAnd I want to knowHave I gone too farAnd I want to knowIf I've gone too far'Cause I've lost all my self control'Cause I've lost all my self controlNow I've sunk to a brand new lowBrand new lowThere's nothing to do without youBrand new lowThere's noting in here without youBrand new lowI'm slipping away without youHave I sunk to a brand new low
