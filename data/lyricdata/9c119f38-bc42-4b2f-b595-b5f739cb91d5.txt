Run the lip off sunshine shoreBetray white water, delay dark formsSlap young waves on wooden bonesDon't touch the laughter and away we goAway we go (And away we go)Away we go (Away we go)Away we go (And away we go)Away we go (Away)Clap your hands (But I feel so lonely)Clap your hands (But it won't do nothing)Just clap your hands (But I have no money)Just clap your hands (But it don't seem like me)Yeah, clap your hands (Are you up to something?)Clap your hands (Where's my milk and honey?)Just clap your hands (But I just look funny)And clap your handsI'll just wait awhileAs time alone stands still for someStuffed sailor up, up with eyeball sunAnd if by castle ship should strayIt has like you no chosen fateFor it's tongue-tied caboose that leads this ragged ladThis finger-flipping mom and dadFor what is worth some aimless steerAnd should not confuse my foggy mirrorReveal what is not thereI shall take this unbound train and flow away
