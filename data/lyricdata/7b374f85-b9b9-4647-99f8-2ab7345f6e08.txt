I thought I knew youI guess I took myselfRight down the wrong roadLeading to the pastI know you're tryingTo rearrange your mindBut you were lyingDo you laugh in my faceTurn back turn back the pagesWho remembers namesWho remembers facesTurn back don't drive yourself crazyLife's too short for ritualistic chasesMaybe tomorrowYou'll find you have to cryAnd in your sorrowSee the mirror it doesn't lieJust like the last timeYou try to pull me downYou are the past timeAnd blind and death to soundTurn back turn back the pagesWho remembers namesWho remembers facesTurn back don't drive yourself crazyLife's too short for repetitious changesNo use denyingYou wasted my timeAnd caused the cryingAnd the bitterness to hideJust trying to proveYou need nobody elseBut you're bound to loseLying to yourselfTurn back turn back the pagesWho remembers namesWho remembers facesTurn back don't drive yourself crazyLife's too short for ritualistic chasesTurn back turn back turn back the pages
