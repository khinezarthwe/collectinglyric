Wait dear, a white horse is walking down my street hereYour words are creeping at my feetI fear, sunrise will come to soon and you'll disappearInto the haze of this city and go southLook out, they're coming after us with big gunsThey're only gonna tell you all the bad things I've doneEven if they words they say aren't true they've wonNow I'm left here dying in the sunOh...seems like I'm always on my ownSeems like I'm never coming homeSeems like I'm always on my ownAll the stars and boulevards aren't close enough for youLate nights, won't do me justiceCause when I drink...I just get so damn depressedAnd its not like, I ain't trying to get over youIt's just hard to look at all the seasons, pass me over tooOh...seems like I'm always on my ownSeems like I'm never coming homeSeems like I'm always on my ownAll the stars and boulevards ain't close enough for youOne last phone call from you, it wouldn't hurt muchJust like to hear your voice and pretend to touchAny inch of you that hasn't said it all or read it all or sungMy life away
