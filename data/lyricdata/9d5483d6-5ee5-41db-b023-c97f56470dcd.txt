I bumped into Joe on Victoria RoadAnd he told me somethingAbout last weekend, he knows your new boyfriend(He said he saw it coming)And those letters I wrote, so now I knowWhat you do with themWell of course he looked, you sliced me upAnd then showed it to himHe's changed around the posters on your wallAnd finished all but one glass of your wineHis head's been on the pillows that I boughtAnd now he's seen me say, "I love you" all those timesAnd the old photos in the silly clothesThere must be much moreGod, the poems I sent and that massive dentI left in your doorI don't want them back, you can burn the lotI just feel betrayedWell it's been this long and all the flesh has goneBut the bones remainHe's changed around the posters on your wallAnd finished all but one glass of your wineHis head's been on the pillows that I boughtAnd now he's seen me say, "I love you" all those timesI still can't get mad at you, no matter how I tryI still can't get mad at you, no matter how I try
