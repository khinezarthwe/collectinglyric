HeyThere's no rules todayYou steal instead of borrowYou take all the shapes that I makeThink that you think all the thoughts that I thought youDon't you?Mutilation's the most sincere form of flattery.If you want to be me,Then stand in line like the restNow, do you know what I mean?The young get less bolderThe legends get olderBut I stay the same as long as you have less to sayDo you think that I wouldn't say this?You know that I play this better than you.Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you too,Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you too,Do you really think that I wouldn't say this?You know that I play this better than you.Rebels without applauseI sell my shadow to those who are standing in itThey think I would bitch about themThinking they are the shitWhen they can't even step in itThe young get less bolderThe legends get olderBut I stay the same as long as you have less to sayDo you think that I wouldn't say this?You know that I play this better than you.Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you too,The young get less bolderThe legends get olderBut I stay the same as long as you have less to sayDo you think that I wouldn't say this?You know that I play this better than you.Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you too,The young get less bolderThe legends get olderBut I stay the same as long as you have less to sayDo you think that I wouldn't say this?You know that I play this better than you.Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you too,Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you too,Do you think that I wouldn't say this?You know that I play this better than you.
