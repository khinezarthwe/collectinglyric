I don't care what you saidI won't sink in the floodBut I listen to every noiseThat you make and make sense of what you sayAnd I take note to every soundWe're not the same againDon't you dare insinuate meYou don't care what you createYou can't swim in this floodAnd you'll swallow with every waveThat comes by and take, take what you needYou'll still swallow with every tideWe're not the same againDon't you dare insinuate meTo hell with that!
