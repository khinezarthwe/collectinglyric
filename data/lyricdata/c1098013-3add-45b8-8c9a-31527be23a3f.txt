My love is like footsteps in the snow, babyI follow you everywhere you go, babyThe pain inside has come to wake youBut you will never realizeThat I inspire the dreams that guide you, babyYou're half a world awayBut in my mind I whisper every single word you sayAnd before you sleep at nightYou pray to me, your lucky star, your singing satelliteYour singing satelliteYou say a prayerYou say a prayerYou're half a world awayBut in my mind I whisper every single word you sayAnd before you sleep at nightYou pray to me, your lucky star, your singing satelliteI follow the winds that bring the cold, babyI light a fire in your soul, babyThe lightest touch of feathers fallingMy love may be invisibleBut I inspire the dreams that guide you, babyYou're half a world awayBut in my mind I whisper every single word you sayAnd before you sleep at nightYou pray to me, your lucky star, your singing satellite
