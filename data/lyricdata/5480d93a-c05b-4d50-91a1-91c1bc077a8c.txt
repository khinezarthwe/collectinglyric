As I'm talking my wordsSlip to the floorAnd they crawl through your legsSlide underThe back doorRendering meFreakish and dazedWell here I am dont know how to say thisOnly thing I knowIs awkward silenceYour eyelids closeWhen you're around meTo shut me outSo I'll go walking in the streetsUntil my heels bleedAnd ill sing out my songIn case the birds wish to sing alongAnd ill dig a tunnel to the center of the universeWell here I am dont know how to say thisOnly thing I know is awkward silenceYour eyelids close when youre around meTo shut me outI'll make my way across the frozen seaBeyond the blank horizonWhere I can forget you and meAnd get a decent night sleepWell here I am dont know how to say thisOnly thing I know is awkward silenceYour eyelids close when youre around meTo shut me outWell here I am dont know how to say thisOnly thing I know is awkward silenceYour eyelids close when youre around meTo shut me outTo shut me out(dont shut me out)To shut me out(dont shut me out)To shut me out(dont count me out)To shut me out(dont shut me out)
