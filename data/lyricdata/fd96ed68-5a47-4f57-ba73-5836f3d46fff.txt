Seems like only yesterdayLife belonged to runawaysNothing here to seeNo looking backEvery sound monotoneEvery color monochromeLife began to fade into the blackSuch a simple animalSterilized with alcoholI could hardly feel me anymoreDesperate and meaninglessAll filled up with emptinessFelt like everything was said and doneI lay there in the darkAnd I close my eyesYou saved me the day you came aliveStill I tried to find my waySpinning hours into daysBurning like a flame behind my eyesDrown it outDrink it inCrown the king of sufferingPrisoner; a slave to the disguiseDisappear the only thingBittersweet surrenderingKnew that it was time to say goodbyeI lay there in the darkAnd I close my eyesYou saved me the day you came aliveNo reason left for me to surviveYou saved me the day you came aliveCome aliveCome alive...(16x)I lay there in the darkAnd I close my eyesYou saved me the day you came aliveCome aliveCome alive...(16x)Nothing more to giveI can finally liveCome aliveYou're not killing meI can finally breatheCome aliveI lay there in the darkOpen my eyesYou saved me the day you came aliveCome aliveCome alive(16x)
