I'm not the sort of person who falls in and quickly out of loveBut to you I gave my affection right from the startI have a lover who loves me, how could I break such a heartYet still you get my attentionWhy do you come here when you know I've got troubles enoughWhy do you call me when you know I can't answer the phoneMake me lie when I don't want toAnd make someone else some kind of unknowing foolYou make me stay when I should notAre you so strong or is all the weakness in meWhy do you come here and pretend to be just passing byBut I need to see youAnd I need to hold you, tightlyFeeling guilty, worried, waking from tormented sleepThis old love has me bound but the new love cuts deepIf I choose now, I'll lose out, one of you has to fallAnd I need you, and youWhy do you come here when you know I've got troubles enoughWhy do you call me when you know I can't answer the phoneMake me lie when I don't want toAnd make someone else some kind of unknowing foolYou make me stay when I should notAre you so strong or is all the weakness in meWhy do you come here and pretend to be just passing byBut I need to see youAnd I need to hold you, tightly
