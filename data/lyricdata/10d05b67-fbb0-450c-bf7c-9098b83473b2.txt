Well, I'm a damn straight shootin' manRide with a gun in my handLookin' for a girl who'll understandDon't want responsibilityI don't care about holes in jeansI gotta get out tonight and seeHope i don't get in a fightJust because i grabbed some nice ass that don't belong to meI met a woman that said i stunkI got a speed stick, damn you're drunkShe felt good round her ass and thighShe grabbed me low, I grabbed her highSaid, "Take me backstage, pretty please""Just let me finish up this here drink"Sat there about to change my mindWhen she turned and said, "Honey child?"ChorusÂ :Take me drunk, I'm homeTake me drunk, I'm stonedTake me drunk, wanna bone?Take me drunk, gotta phone?Take me drunk, where's my car?Take me drunk, am i far?Take me drunk, what's your name?Take me drunk, is this a bar?Had to think just a little moreThis chick was beginning to boreDidn't know if she was gonna scoreThat was when i started to ignoreI don't care about holes in jeansI gotta get out tonight and seeHope I don't get in a fightJust because i grabbed some nice ass that don't belong to meChorus
