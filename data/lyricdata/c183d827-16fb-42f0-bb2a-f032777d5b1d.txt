Bright, just like the stars above meProud, just like my mother planned itShort, on all the things I don't wantI'm full of love and longingTake me by the hand and tell meYou would take me anywhereYou would take me anywhereStill, cause I don't want to move a thingAnd I'm sure that you'll fit right into meAnd all the things I don't want they're fullOf love and longingTake me by the hand and tell meYou would take me anywhereYou would take me anywhereAnd it goesIt's like a come on, come on to meAnd it goesIt's like a come on, come on to meYouYou say you dont see any part of meTo love in all this messAnd I know you take the good and all the badThat comes with me
