I haven't heard this song in yearsIt never fails to start the tearsA country lane and the smell of pineA stripey blouse and some cheap English wineAnd my dad's car would never startBut one phone call rescued two love heartsAnd did I splash mud on your coatYeah you wore mine and I got coldJust what went wrong?You never said just what went wrongYou never said just what went wrongWe've got some good friends still in ManchesterSometimes I think I'd like to live back thereOh that was just embarrassingAt times I say the most stupid thingsAnd then your name's still mentioned next to mineThat's what you hated at the timeI know I said that it just couldn't lastBut people get used to things so fastJust what went wrong?You never said just what went wrongI've walked behind you for more than an hourI don't even think that I know this part of townI think I'm trying to find a way to talk to you againI think I'm trying to find a way to bring you back againOh won't you please come back again
