You just stood there screamingFearing no one was listening to youThey say the empty can rattles the mostThe sound of your own voice must soothe youHearing only what you want to hear,And knowing only what you've heardYou...you're smothered in tragedy,And you're out to save the worldMisery!You insist that the weight of the worldShould be on your shouldersMisery!There's much more to life than what you seeMy Friend Of Misery!You still stood there screaming!No-one caring about these words you tellMy friend before your voice is goneOne man's fun is another's hellThese times are sent to try men's soulsBut something's wrong with all you seeYou...you'll take it on all yourself(Remember), Misery loves companyMisery!You insist that the weight of the worldShould be on your shouldersMiseryThere's much more to life than what you seeMy Friend Of Misery!Misery!You insist that the weight of the worldShould be on your shouldersMiseryThere's much more to life than what you seeMy Friend Of MiseryMy Friend Of Misery!You just stood there screaming, ohMy Friend Of Misery!
