I would be overstatingIf I said I knew you wellThat I knew you at allWhen you flew through that windshieldAnd your life passed reel to reelWas there a bit part for me?I made a wish for youBlew out the sun so it'd come trueBut the sun froze along with your heartSo give up, give up your loveGive up, give up your loveI promise its not gonna kill yaAnd I need ya, Lord I need yaAnd when they cut up your lungYou said it could all breathe easyThe hole swallowed your heartWhen they drill holes in your skullAnd screwed that halo to your headDid you think you could fly?I made a prayer for youThen prayed some more that it'd come trueDon't know about God but I believe in youSo give up, give up your loveGive up, give up your loveI promise it's not gonna kill yaAnd I need ya, Lord I need yaAnd though you haven't got a lot to give upA good man is easy to kill wellStop talking about the weather and say you're getting better
