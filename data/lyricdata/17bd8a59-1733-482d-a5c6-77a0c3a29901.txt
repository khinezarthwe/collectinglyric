You saw me standing in the rainWith a heart that was filled with regretDidn't youI heard you calling out my nameYou gave me more than I hoped I could getDidn't youDidn't you call my nameWhen I was down lowDidn't you call my nameAnd bring me round ohAhhhh-ahhhAin't it good when somebody loves youAhhhh-ahhhAin't it good when somebody loves youYou sweetly smiled and held my handIn your eyes I could see that you caredDidn't you (didn't you)You made me glad to understandAn empty heart needn't drown in despairDidn't you (didn't you)Didn't you call my nameWhen I was down lowDidn't you call my nameAnd bring me round ohBluebirds are merrily calling meOut of the blueBluebirds are merrily calling meAhhhh-ahhhAin't it good when somebody loves youAhhhh-ahhhAin't it good when somebody loves youAin't it good when somebody loves youAin't it good when somebody loves youAin't it good when somebody loves youAin't it good when somebody loves youAin't it good when somebody loves you
