On a cobweb afternoonIn a room full of emptinessBy a freeway I confessI was lost in the pagesOf a book full of deathReading how we'll die aloneAnd if we're good we'll lay to restAnywhere we want to goIn your house I long to beRoom by room patientlyAnd I'll wait for you thereLike a stoneI'll wait for you thereAloneAnd on my deathbed I will prayTo the gods and the angelsLike a pagan to anyoneWho will take me to HeavenTo a place I recallI was there so long agoThe sky was bruised, the wine was bledAnd there you led me onIn your house I long to beRoom by room patientlyI'll wait for you thereLike a stoneI'll wait for you thereAlone, aloneAnd on I readUntil the day was goneAnd I sat in regretOf all the things I've doneFor all that I've blessedAnd all that I've wrongedIn dreams until my deathI will wander onIn your house I long to beRoom by room patientlyAnd I'll wait for you thereLike a stoneI'll wait for you thereAlone, alone
