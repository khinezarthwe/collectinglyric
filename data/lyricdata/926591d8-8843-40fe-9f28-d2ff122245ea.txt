You can fake it for a whileBite your tongue and smile like every mother does her ugly childBut it starts to leaking outLike spittle from a cloud, amassed resentment pelting ounce and poundYou entertaining any doubts?'Cause you had to know that I was fond of you, fond of y-o-uThough I knew you masked your disdainI can see that change was just too hard for us, hard for usYou always had to hold the reins, but where I'm headed you just don't know the waySo affections fade awayAnd do adults just learn to play the most ridiculous, repulsive games?All our favorite ruddy sonsAnd their double-barreled guns, you'd better hurry, rabbit, run, run, run 'cause mincing you is funAnd there's a lot of hungry hatters in this world, set on taking it overBut brittle thorny stemsThey break before they bend and neither one of us is one of themAnd the tears will never mend'Cause you had it in for me so long ago, boy, I still don't knowI don't know why and I don't care, well, hardly anymoreIf you'd only seen yourself hating me, hating me when I'd been so much more than fairBut then you'd have to lay those feelings bare, the one thing I know has still got you scaredYeah, all that cold ire and never once aired on a dareYou had to know that I was fond of you, fond of y-o-uSo I took your licks at the timeAnd a change like that is just so hard to do, hard to doDon't let it whip-crack your lifeAnd I'll bow out from the fightThose old pious sisters were rightThe worst part is overNow get back on that horse and ride
