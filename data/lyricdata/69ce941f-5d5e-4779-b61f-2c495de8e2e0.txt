It's cold outsideAnd the paint's peeling off of my wallsThere's a man outsideIn a long coat, grey hat, smoking a cigaretteNow the light fades outAnd I wonder what I'm doing in a room like thisThere's a knock on the doorAnd just for a second I thought I remembered youSo now I'm aloneNow I can think for myselfAbout little deals and issuesAnd things that I just don't understandLike a white lie that nightOr a sly touch at timesI don't think it meant anything to youSo I open the doorIt's the 'friend' that I left in the hallway"Please sit down."A candlelit shadow on a wall near the bedYou know I hate to askBut are 'friends' electric?Only mine's broke downAnd now I've no one to loveSo I found out your reasonsFor the phone calls and smilesAnd it hurts and I'm lonelyAnd I should never have triedAnd I miss you tonightSo it's time to leaveYou see it meant everything to me
