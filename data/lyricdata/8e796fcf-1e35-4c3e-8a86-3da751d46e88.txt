Time stands still in my heartI don't know where you areLonging for what I denyCan we just turn it around tonight?(Chorus x2)And do you know without you I just go crazy?And do you know that all I think about is where you are?And do you know that only you can save me baby?From going through this life all aloneWhen will missing you stopSeems we lost before the startHolding back what was insideCan we just let it all out tonight?And do you know?And do you know?And do you know?And do you know?(Chorus x2)Do you knowDon't look back on yesterdayI believe we can find a wayDon't let hopes and dreams fadeDon't hesitate it's not too lateI go crazyI go crazyAnd do you know?And do you know?And do you know?And do you know?(Chorus x2)
