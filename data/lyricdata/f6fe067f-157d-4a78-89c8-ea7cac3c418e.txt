I don't know where I'm going, but I can't wait to get there,All I know is, I'm just goingI ran away from home last night, gone foreverI was running for my lifeAnd I've heard the words of what I should beLive, Work, Die, I am the orphan of the nightTake me down, I'm coming home, the road to ruinsInside the pleasure domeTake me down, I'm coming home, arena of pleasuresWhere I belongI'm in the eye of my rage, where no hurricane diesI'm in the eye of my rage, where the hurricane liesOh, a storm's in my eyesAnd like the beast that's in my soul, I'm the restless childAh mama, I'm running for my lifeI was sixteen going nowhere, will I see seventeen aliveAnd I was running from the nightmarestand at the promised land with fire in my eyesI'm at the crossroad of my destiny and desireOh, God, what will I beAnd my obsession is the gasoline to feed my fireOh it's burning in meDon't waste the tears on my wasted yearsMama I'm outta here
