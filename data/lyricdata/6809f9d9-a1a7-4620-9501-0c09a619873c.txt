Cold and frosty morning, there's not a lot to sayAbout the things caught in my mindAnd as the day is dawning my plane flew awayWith all the things caught in my mindI don't wanna be there when you're coming downI don't wanna be there when you hit the groundSo don't go awaySay what you saySay that you'll stayForever and a dayIn the time of my life'Cause I need more timeYes, I need more timeJust to make things rightDamn my situation and the games I have to playWith all the things caught in my mindDamn my education, I can't find the words to sayWith all the things caught in my mindAnd I wanna be there when you're coming downAnd I wanna be there when you hit the groundSo don't go awaySay what you saySay that you'll stayForever and a dayIn the time of my life'Cause I need more timeYes, I need more timeJust to make things rightMe and you, what's going onAll we seem to know is how to showThe feelings that are wrongSo don't go awaySay what you saySay that you'll stayForever and a dayIn the time of my life'Cause I need more timeYes, I need more timeJust to make things rightAnd don't go awaySay what you saySay that you'll stayForever and a dayIn the time of my life'Cause I need more timeYes, I need more timeJust to make things rightYes, I need more timeJust to make things rightYes, I need more timeJust to make things rightSo don't go away
