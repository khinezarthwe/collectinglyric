Well I can see you standing there like you know what to doYou all think you know me but you haven't got a clueWell I can see you looking but you're looking at the floorBut I don't think I really care 'cause you've paid at the doorAnd it's not that I'm not the romantic typeIt's just that I like what I choose to likeAnd if you'd only take the time to look my wayIf you would only take the time to see well I might let you stayI know that you want something and you want it from meEveryone says we're the same but I just can not seeAnd I know what you're asking for 'cause I've just read the signWould paying once or maybe twice be really such a crime?And it's not that I'm not the romantic typeIt's just that I like what I choose to likeAnd if you'd only take the time to look my wayIf you would only take the time to see well I might let you stay1-2-3-4It's not that I'm not the romantic typeIt's just that I like what I choose to likeAnd it's not that I'm not the romantic typeIt's just that I like what I choose to like
