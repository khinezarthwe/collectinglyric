I can't help myself. One aim one try. One chance one eye. So come on lets flyOoh desire. Tell you once. Won't tell you twice.When the spirit moves the world we're gonna start a fire. A fire.Just one beat, just one heartJust one beat, just one heartI can't help myself. I can't help myself.I can't help myself. Baby I can't help myselfOne sound, one band, moving free in electric landNever running for coverSomeday soon you'll see us next to you.And we can dance like we are two.That's true, like lovers. Like loversJust one beat, just one heartJust one beat, just one heartI can't help myself. I can't help myself.I can't help myself. Baby I can't help myselfNothing like this dream come trueNothing like my time with youYou're a perfect friend of mineA rock that still should stand all timeOne aim, one tryOne tear, one eyeOoh desire.One sound, one band, walkin' free in electric landGonna start a fire. I can't help myself.Ooh we're gonna start a fire. We can't help ourselves.Just one beat, just one heartI can't help myself. I can't help myself.I can't help myself. Baby I can't help myself
