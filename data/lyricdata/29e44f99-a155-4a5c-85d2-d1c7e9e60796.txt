If I had no bad luck, I'd have no luck at allHangin' by a thread from the edge of the worldFeel I'm about to fallRain fallin' on the day I was bornUnder a bad sign, shoved into a bindDown, down like a flaming falling starIf I had no bad luck, I'd have no luck at allHard luck championI got my hands in my pocketBut there ain't no moneyHard luck championNight prowler, sicker than a dogSmilin' through a fang smile, rotten to the coreShame, shame, got no middle nameGot me twenty rabbit feet, but still I lose the gameHard luck championI got my hands in my pocketBut there ain't no moneyHard luck championLike a bee in the hiveBut there ain't no honeyHard luckHard luckHard luckIf I had no bad luck, I'd have no luck at allWell, there's winners and there's losersSinners and choosersDirty grins and innocent bluesWhich one are you?Damn shame, it seems that we're the sameWith a four leaf clover and a lucky charmWe just can't shake the pain
