I've foundÂ ??A rainy day foreverBell that pingsTime and loose won't last away foreverAnd I became the tall care freeIn your head dreams that never ever endOn to B.CTo breath the air till never??You and I and me and you togetherAnd I became the tall refrainIn your head dreams that never ever endSay Hello to meSail away with meRe-drawn the earthWe slept till we were frozen??We spoke in tongs we never wanted spokenAnd you saidTime will changeThese thingsFor you will always be the sameSay Hello to meSail away with meNow that I'm awakeYou know that we are brokenThe tiny handIs past with doors, were shut they are now are openCause I'm still the tall care freeIn your head dreams that never ever endSay hello to meSail away with meSay hello to meSail away
