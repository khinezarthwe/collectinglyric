This wicked cityJust drags you downYou're with the red lightsYour side of townDon't say it's easyTo follow a processThere's nothing harderThan keeping a promiseBlood runs through your veinsThat's where our similarity endsBlood runs through our veinsBlood runs through your veinsThat's where our similarity endsBlood runs through our veinsThere's nothing believableIn being honestSo cover your lies upWith another promiseBlood runs through your veinsThat's where our similarity endsBlood runs through our veinsBlood runs through your veinsThat's where our similarity endsBlood runs through our veinsBlood runs through your veins,That's where our similarity endsBlood runs through our veinsIf there's hope in your heartIt would flow to every partIf there's hope in your heart
