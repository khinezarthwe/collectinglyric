On our trip to England I noticed something obscenePeople still actually give a shit about the QueenThough London girls aren't snobs at alland Brighton's lovely in the FallLeft alone to drive ourselves on the opposite sideMan it was a miracle that nobody diedHanging out with Steven Drew, Theo,Paul and Sorrel tooEating at Welcome Breaks dailyWe danced in Leeds with Brit Pop HaleyPerforming with the Applesand then crashing at the WrightsBitching because Steven booked uson such early flightsAlways in a foggy hazebecause we hadn't slept for daysEvery single one of our London cabbies playedThe most truly repellent techno music ever madeBut they'll drop you without hesitation if you try changing the stationUp to our necks in crisps and litterin the van we dubbed the Gary Glitter
