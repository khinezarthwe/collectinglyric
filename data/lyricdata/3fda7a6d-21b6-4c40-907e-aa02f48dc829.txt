Thats the one, OyHow did he not find the baggy, with his hand in my shoe?Way too close for me, ah well at least they allowed me through.Should be a good night in here, Ramo in the main room,People keep pushing me though, no reception on the phone.And I'm thinkin'...(Lights are blinding my eyes)They said they'd be here they said, they said in the corner,And I'm thinkin'...(People pushin' by, and walkin' off into the night)These look well speckly, bit of green and blue,Freeze is well cheap though, so I'll take three if I need to.Right I'm on the plan, I wish the bouncers would go away,Borrow water off this man, here goes nothing OKAnd I'm thinkin'...(Lights are blinding my eyes)That's proper rank, that tastes like hairsprayAnd I'm thinkin'...(People pushin' by, and walkin' off into the night)I hate coming to the entrance, just to get bars on my phone,You have no new messages, so why haven't they phoned?Menu, write message, so where are you and Simone?Send message, Dan's number, where've they gone?And I'm thinkin'...(Lights are blinding my eyes)Why's the message pending? where the fuck are ya?And I'm thinkin'...(People pushin' by, and walkin' off into the night)Hmm, brandy or beer? Waters a good idea,Wish that bar lady'd appear; and come serve over here.Where the fuck could they be? still not over in the corner,This night's a tragedy, I keep thinking I saw her.And I'm thinkin'...(Lights are blinding my eyes)No that's not them, that's not them either...And I'm thinkin'...(People pushin' by, and walkin' off into the night)I'm still not feeling anything, this has got to be a dud.It's been ages since I necked it, and smoked six tabs to the nub.Belly's not even tingling, I just feel a bit pissed...No-one looks like minglin', I cant see her or him...And I'm thinkin'...(Lights are blinding my eyes)I'm gonna do another i think. Yeah, one more, these are shit.And I'm thinkin'...(People pushin' by, and walkin' off into the night)These toilets are a piss take, queue's bigger than the door.Gotta get rid of this pill taste, what are they chattin' so much for?Glad I'm not a girl in this place, they'll be here til dawn.Sure my belly's tingling a bit, somethings happening I'm sure.And I'm thinkin'...(Lights are blinding my eyes)Maybe I shouldn't have done the second one, I feel all fidgety and warm...(People pushin' by, and walkin' off into the night)Whoa, everything in the room is spinning, I think I'm going to fall down,My heart's beating to quick, I'm fucking tripping out.I wonder whether they got in, turned away no doubt.Who cares, this is a tune coming in, that one noise is like..I'm thinkin'...(Lights are blinding my eyes)My eyes are rolling back, I'm rubbing my thighs with my hand.And I'm thinkin'...(People pushin' by, and walkin' off into the night)Yeah yeah they cheer - can they see my hand in the air?Need to wave 'em over here. Swear Simone's kissing Dan.My head is twisted severe, body's rushing everywhere,They could have texted me when they were here, but I'm fucked and I don't care.(Lights are blinding my eyes)What was I thinkin' about? Ah who cares, I'm maaaashed.(People pushin' by, and walkin' off into the night)Totally fucked, cant hardly fuckin' stand.This is fuckin' amazing; rahh
