The son of a major, Prussian noblemanHis name bestowed by a holy RomanThe war broke out, and looked to the air24 hours of training he was there100 miles an hourTop speed his plane would flyAnd if he flew behind youYou know you're sure to die80 kills and all confirmedWhile other pilots had so muchMore to learnChorus:Red baron, blue maxThe albatross flies highRed baron, blue maxHe's got you in his sightsBridge:The red battle flyer, red like fireHe sees no faces, the ace of acesHis British quarry flew a reckless flightA shot from the ground took the red baron's lifeHe flew with honor, he flew with prideIn 1918 the battle flyer diedChorus
