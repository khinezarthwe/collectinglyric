I declare I don't care no moreI'm burning up and out and growing boredIn my smoked out boring roomMy hair is shagging in my eyesDragging my feet to hit the street tonightTo drive along these shit town lightsI'm not growing up, I'm just burning outAnd I stepped in line to walk amongst the deadApathy has rained on meNow I'm feeling like a soggy dreamSo close to drowning but I don't mindI've lived in this mental caveThrow my emotions in the graveHell, who needs them anywayI'm not growing up, I'm just burning outAnd I stepped in line to walk amongst the deadI'm not growing up, I'm just burning outAnd I stepped in line to walk amongst the deadI'm not growing up, I'm just burning outAnd I stepped in line to walk amongst the deadI'm not growing up, I'm just burning outAnd I stepped in line to walk amongst the dead
