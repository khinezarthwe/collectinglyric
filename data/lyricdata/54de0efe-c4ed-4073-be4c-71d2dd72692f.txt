This day could be the worst one yetI just won't relax I can't catch my breathBecause I'm sick and tired of you'll be fineWell how do you know, can you read minds(Pre Chorus)So take while you can so you can meet demandsMy insanity is what you thrive onSo rip it from my soul, so everyone will know in the endWe were never friends(Chorus)Have you ever felt lost inside so unloved within that you almost dieHave you ever stepped out of the light and realized there's a stranger insideDon't push your ignorance on meI'm not unrehearsed to your jealousyAnd I know you think I don't see the signsWell how do you know, do I look blind(2nd Pre Chorus)So take it while you can so you can meet demandsMy breakdown is what you thrive onSo rip it from my soul so everyone will know in the endI'm the break you're the bend(Chorus)(Bridge)Stranger inside(Chorus out)
