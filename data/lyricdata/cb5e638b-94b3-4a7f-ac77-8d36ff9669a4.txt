On a long and lonesome highwayEast of OmahaYou listen to the enginesMoanin' out its one songYou think about the womanOr the girl you knew the night beforeBut your thoughts will soon be wanderingThe way they always doWhen you're riding sixteen hoursAnd there's nothing much to doAnd you don't feel much like ridingYou just wish the trip was throughHere I am, on the road againThere I am, up on the stageHere I go, playing star againThere I go, turn the pageSo you walk into this restaurantStrung out from the roadAnd you feel the eyes upon youAs you're shaking off the coldYou pretend it doesn't bother youBut you just want to explodeYeah, most times you can't hear 'em talkOther times you canOh, the same old clich√©s"Is it woman? Is it man?"And you always seem outnumberedYou don't dare make a standMake your standHere I am, on the road againThere I am, up on the stageHere I go, playing star againThere I go, turn the pageOh, out there in the spotlightYou're a million miles awayEvery ounce of energyYou try to give awayAs the sweat pours out your bodyLike the music that you play, yeahLater in the eveningAs you lie awake in bedWith the echoes of the amplifiersRinging in your headYou smoke the day's last cigaretteRemembering what she saidWhat she saidHeyYeah, and here I am, on the road againThere I am, up on that stageHere I go, playing star againThere I go, turn the pageThere I go, turn that pageThere I go, yeah, yeahThere I go, yeah, yeah, yeahThere I go, yeahHere I go, yeahThere I go, ohThere I goAnd I'm gone
