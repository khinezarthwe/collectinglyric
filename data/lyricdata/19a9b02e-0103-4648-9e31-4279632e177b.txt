I will forgive but I won't forgetAnd I hope you knowYou've lost my respectYou better watch outIf you don't know what's going on around youYou better think twiceBefore you fly off the handle and lose itYou better join usBefore you get lost in the shuffleYou gotta rise againstThe demons that are gonna try and hold you downDoes it run in your bloodTo betray the ones you love? [x2]The ones you love - x3'Cause I'm not a pawnFor you to play in your fucking gameI've got dignityAnd a dream that I want to achieveUnder pressureYou crumbled and you let me downAnd I'm not deafAnd all I hear are your empty promisesDoes it run in your bloodTo betray the ones you love? [x4](Blood!)The ones you love [x3]Does it run in your bloodTo betray the ones you love?Yes it runs in your bloodTo betray the ones you loveYes it runs in your bloodTo betray the ones you loveYes it runs in your bloodTo betray the ones you loveYes it runs in your bloodTo betray the ones you loveI will forgive but I won't forgetAnd I hope you knowYou've lost my respectYes it runs in your bloodTo betray the ones you love!
