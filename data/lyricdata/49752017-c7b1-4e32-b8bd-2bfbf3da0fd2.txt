Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken tollWe ducked inside the doorway, thunder crashingAs majestic bells of bolts, struck shadows in the soundsSeeming to be the chimes of freedom flashingFlashing for the warriors, whose strength is not to fightFlashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flightAnd for each and every underdog soldier in the nightAnd we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashingEven though a cloud's white curtain in a far off corner flashedAnd the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly liftingElectric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the onesCondemned to drift or else be kept from driftingTolling for the searching ones, on their speechless seeking trailFor the lonesome hearted lovers, with too personal a taleAnd for each unharmful gentle soul misplaced inside a jailAnd we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashingStarry-eyed and laughing, as I recall when we were caughtTrapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspendedAnd we listened one last time, and we watched with one last lookSpellbound and swallowed 'til the tolling endedTolling for the aching ones whose wounds cannot be nursedFor the countless confused, accused, misused, srung-out ones and worseAnd for every hung-up person in the whole wide universeAnd we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing
