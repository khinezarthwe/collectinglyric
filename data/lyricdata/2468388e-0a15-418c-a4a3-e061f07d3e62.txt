My legacy, a string of lossesMy god, I askHow can you do this?You made the sunThe world, your canvasWith all this I can see how I'm unimportantIn this dreamI am warmThere are hands in my hairAnd it's good to be thereI wave my hand and nothing happensI set my scene and I can't play itI'd leave it to you butIt would turn out backwardsI'd like to believe you're not just recklessAnd you areNostalgic while you are still living thisAnd it allSnuck up while you weren't lookingAnd you areNostalgic while you are still living thisAnd you're sureThis is how you know you're living
