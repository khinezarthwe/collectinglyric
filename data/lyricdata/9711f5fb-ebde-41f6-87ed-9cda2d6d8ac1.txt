I feel so unsureAs I take your hand and lead you to the dance floorAs the music diesSomething in your eyesCalls to mind a silver screenAnd all its sad goodbyesI'm never gonna dance again'Cause guilty feet have got no rhythmThough it's easy to pretendI know you're not a foolI should have known better than to cheat a friendAnd waste the chance that I'd been givenSo I'm never gonna dance againThe way I dance with youTime can never mendThe careless whispers of a good friendTo the heart and mindIgnorance is kindThere's no comfort in the truthPain is all you'll findI'm never gonna dance again'Cause guilty feet have got no rhythmThough it's easy to pretendI know you're not a foolI should have known better than to cheat a friendAnd waste the chance that I'd been givenSo I'm never gonna dance againThe way I dance with youTonight the music seems so loudI wish that we could lose this crowdMaybe it's better this wayWe'd hurt each other with the things we want to sayWe could have been so good togetherWe could have lived this dance foreverNow, who's gonna dance with me?Please stayI'm never gonna dance again'Cause guilty feet have got no rhythmThough it's easy to pretendI know you're not a foolI should have known better than to cheat a friendAnd waste the chance that I'd been givenSo I'm never gonna dance againThe way I dance with you
