My feet were fumblingAnd I couldn't step in timeAnd the time was moving so slowI was outside of what I sawI was on the right side of the lawI was lost inside a showI lost the right to let thisGo away you'll never know the wayTo overcome your flawless faceAnd outgrow your gawkish graceBut I'm not not nervous nowI was stumblingAnd I had no sense of timeBut I was so intent on somethingYou were so unkindYou were off-hand fit and refinedYou were fineYou were finally okayI finally got my chanceGo away you'll never know the wayTo overcome your flawless faceAnd forget these final daysBut I'm not not nervous now
