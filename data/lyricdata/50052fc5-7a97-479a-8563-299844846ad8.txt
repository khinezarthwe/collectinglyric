Jesus, it never ends; it works its way inside!If the pain goes on...I push my fingers into my eyes!It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache!If the pain goes on, I'm not gonna make it!nothing is what it seems!I push my fingers into my eyes!It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache!But it's made of all the things I have to take!Jesus, it never ends; it works its way inside!If the pain goes on, I'm not gonna make it!All I've got, all I've got is insane!All I've got, all I've got is insane!All I've got, all I've got is insane!All I've got, all I've got is insane!I push my fingers intoeyes!It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache!But it's made of all the things I have to take!Jesus, it never ends; it works its way inside!If the pain goes on, I'm not gonna make it!All I've got, all I've got is insane!All I've got, all I've got is insane!All I've got, all I've got is insane!
