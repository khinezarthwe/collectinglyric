Say to her, say to herCan you remember the first time we met?Don't you remember the first caress?Waiting there, waiting thereStanding alone on the corner in the nightCan you remember the first time?But if you waitBut if you waitI will open to youI will be with youAnd if you waitAnd if you waitI will cross the oceanI will be with you soonSay to her, say to herCan you remember the night that you left?Scanning the crowd out in the squareBut if you waitBut if you waitI will take your handAnd you'll understandAnd if you waitAnd if you waitI will be with you soonI'll cross the ocean blueDo you remember?Do you remember?And if you waitAnd if you waitI will come by nightAnd I'll be by your sideAnd if you waitAnd if you waitIf you don't rememberYou will remember soon
