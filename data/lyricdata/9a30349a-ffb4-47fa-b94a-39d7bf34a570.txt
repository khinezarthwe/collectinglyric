There's a grey horse standin' stillAs a soldier climbs in the saddle for one last rideAs the rain pours off his hatYou can see the shadows of the past written in his eyesNow the cannons are silentHis friends are all goneGotta put it all behind himIf he ever wants to find his way homeHe's the last rebel on the roadJust a boy with his old guitarKeeps to himselfbut everybody takes him wrongBut he carries onGot a dream that will never dieCan't change him, no use in stayin' where you don't belongNow he's rollin' down the highwayGone too far too fastNo one will ever find himhe'll never look back(chorus)'Cause he's the last rebelAnd he's all aloneHe's the last rebelHis friends are all goneHe's the last rebelThe last rebel on the roadThere'll never be another like himHe's the last of a dying breedAin't no use in tryin' to tame him'Cause he's the last rebelAnd he's all aloneHe's the last rebelHis friends are all goneHe's the last rebelgotta carry onHe's the last rebelThe last rebel on the roadHe's the last rebelHe's the last rebelHe's the last rebelHe's the last rebel
