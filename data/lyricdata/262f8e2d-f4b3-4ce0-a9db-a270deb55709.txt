I wanted you to stayOn that sun drenched holidayTwo visions on a flyOnly you and IThose replicas remindHeld out in daydream timeAnd that saddleless driveBeneath the empty skyThose were happy timesForget the fewThose quiet firesAdd nothing on youWe almost lost our mindsIn the battlesideThose were happy timesLike love, lustSometimes you haveTo kill the one you trustWe could only tryThose were happy timesOh so happyThose were happy timesOh so happySomewhere out thereSomeone's breaking down the barricadeTo heat all flamesSomeone else becomes the slave
