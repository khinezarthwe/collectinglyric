I could have treated you betterBut you couldn't have treated me worseBut it's he who laughs lastIt is he who cries firstSometimes I feel I know strangersbetter than I know my friendsWhy must a beginningbe the means to an end?The stones from my enemiesthese wounds will mendBut I cannot survivethe roses from my friendsWhen the last word has been spokenand we've beared witness to the final setting sunAll that shall remain is a tokenof what we've said and doneWhen all we've had has been forsakenAnd distant church bells no longer ringThat's the sound of a heart takenand the story of tears from a kingThe stones from my enemiesthese wounds will mendBut I cannot survivethe roses from my friendsThis may be the last time I see youForgive me for holding you closeThis may be the last time I see youSo of this moment I will make the mostThis may be the last time I see youBut if you keep me in your hearttogether we shall be eternalIf you believewe shall never partThe stones from my enemiesThese wounds will mendBut I cannot survivethe roses from my friends
