What's left inside him?Don't he remember us?Can't he believe me?We seemed like brothersTalked for hours last monthAbout what we wanna beI sit now with his hand in mineBut I know he can't feel...No one knowsWhat's done is doneIt's as if he were deadI'm close with his motherAnd she cries endlesslyLord how we miss himAt least what's rememberedIt's so important to make best friends in lifeBut it's hard when my friend sits with blank expressionsNo one knowsWhat's done is doneIt's as if he were deadHe as hollow as I aloneA shell of my friendJust flesh and boneThere's no soulHe sees no loveI shake my fists at skies aboveMad at GodHe as hollow as I converseI wish he'd waken from this curseHear my words before it's throughI want to come in after youMy best friendMy best friendCome backHe as hollow as I alone
