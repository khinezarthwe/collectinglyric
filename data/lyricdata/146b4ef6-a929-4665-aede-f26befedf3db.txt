Way across the plainsThe lights spell out a code.No one knows where they take us,But we'll search 'til we grow old.All the paths they leadTo the single solemn place.Then we'll stay for a weekendAnd leave without a trace.Just for tonight.Just maybe we've made it.Sing like you want this,Sing like you want this.Just for tonight.Just maybe we've made it.Sing like you want this,Sing like you want this.We can take tonight,Take our time.So sing like you need thisAnd be who you want to.All the paths they leadTo a little standing place.If you stay for a weekendYou'd leave without a trace.Just for tonight.Just maybe we've made it.Sing like you want this,Sing like you want this.Just for tonight.Just maybe we've made it.Sing like you want this,Sing like you want this.Lalalala lalalalala.Lalalala lalalalala.Lalalala lalalalala.Just for tonight,Just for tonight.Just maybe we've made it.Sing like you want this,Sing like you want this.Just for tonight.Just maybe we've made it.Sing like you want this,Sing like you want this.
