I know there's something in the wake of your smileI get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeahYou've built a love but that love falls apartYour little piece of heaven turns too darkListen to your heartWhen he's calling for youListen to your heartThere's nothing else you can doI don't know where you're goingAnd I don't know why,But listen to your heartBefore you tell him goodbyeSometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhileThe precious moments are all lost in the tide, yeahThey're swept away and nothing is what is seems,The feeling of belonging to your dreamsListen to your heartWhen he's calling for youListen to your heartThere's nothing else you can doI don't know where you're goingAnd I don't know why,But listen to your heartBefore you tell him goodbyeAnd there are voicesThat want to be heardSo much to mentionBut you can't find the wordsThe scent of magic,The beauty that's beenWhen love was wilder than the windListen to your heartWhen he's calling for youListen to your heartThere's nothing else you can doI don't know where you're goingAnd I don't know why,But listen to your heartBefore you tell him goodbyeListen to your heartI don't know where you're goingAnd I don't know why,But listen to your heartBefore you tell him goodbye
