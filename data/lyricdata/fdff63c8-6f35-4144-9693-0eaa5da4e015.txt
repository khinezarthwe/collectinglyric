I feel sorrow for the fearAnd everything it bringsWonder if it will ever sleepI know you understand'Cause you briefly look awayFocusin' on nothin' so now everything is clear'Cause there's no one to blameYou got no place to hideIt's only in your mindAnd I saw youIn amazementStumblin' through the dayYou told me time never waitsWhat is that supposed to meanAll of lifeIs in one drop of the oceanWaitin' to go homeJust waitin' to go homeAnd if the moonCan turn the tides it can pull the tears and take 'em from our eyesAnd make 'em into monsoonsAnd turn 'em into monsoonsSooner or later they'll weave their way back to the seaGonna finally be freeFree for a whileUntil they breakLike waves of sorrow always do all in due time'Cause time never waitsDaddy don't daydream againJust help me to believe and thenShow me that there's more than the meantimeSonny do you hear the soundYou will feel it when it breaksYou will know it when its goneHow else can I explain'Cause there's only the painComin' straight throughComin' to your mindCross cut to youIn amazementStumblin' through the dayYou tell me time never waitsThats OK cause I don't wait for timeWhen all of lifeIs in one drop of the oceanWaitin' to go homeJust waitin' to go homeAnd if the moonCan turn the tides it can pull the tears and take 'em from our eyesAnd turn 'em into monsoonsAnd make 'em into monsoonsSooner or later they'll weave their way back to the seaGonna finally be freebe free for a whileUntil they breakLike waves of sorrow always break all in due time'Cause time never waits
