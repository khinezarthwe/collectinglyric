[Music and lyrics: Chris Lykins]Always put others down, passing out the blameIgnorance and your attitude make you all the sameNever try to befriend, never lend a handDraw so many barriers, I'll never understand[Chorus:]Why won't you listenWhy can't you hearI guess your scene won't let youIs change what you fear?You say your scene preaches individualityThe more I see the more I know thats not realityI walk into your parties, I guess I don't look rightNo one even talks to me, no one meets my sightWhat makes me so different, so much I can't fit inIs having different hair and clothes such a mortal sinTell me what's wrong with me I'd reeally like to knowI'm trying to be your friend not another foe[Repeat chorus][Solo: Rick]Always put others down, passing out the blameIgnorance and your attitude make you all the sameNever try to befriend, never lend a handDraw so many barriers, I'll never understandYou say your scene preaches individualityThe more I see the more I know thats not realityI walk into your parties, I guess I don't look rightNo one even talks to me, no one meets my sight[Repeat chorus]
