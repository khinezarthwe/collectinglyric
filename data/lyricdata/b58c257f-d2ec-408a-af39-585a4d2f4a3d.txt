How can you be sleeping?Waves like weapons crashO'er us, cry for mercyAnd hold fast hopeHopeWho of us is cursed, or do we have to ask?Search your souls and hold fastIf no one speaks a word, then let the lots be castTruth be told and hold fastWhite death wakes in black skiesMark your maker's wrathFear and flames of azureClimb the crooked mastYou will yet be baptizedSteeped in shattered glassSink and sing your answerAnd hold fastAs strong arms grip your shouldersLike dead hands of your pastPray as you're tossed overThis breath could be your lastQuiet and coldSilent and slowNight black as coalMiles here belowFind your faith and dive deepThrough living gateways passLined with death and ivoryAnd hold fast, hold fastDeep beneath the black dawnLeagues from lightning's flashRibs will raise cathedralsFor the morning massSteel yourself in sackclothRoll your heart in ashScrape your skin with steel woolAnd hold fastRibs will raise cathedralsFor the morning massScrape your skin with steel woolCross your heart and hold fast hopeHold fast hopeHold fast hope.
