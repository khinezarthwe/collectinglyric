Long time comingBut no one seen it comingLong gone thenAnd your heart is still runningNow you're thinking bout the timesAnd the things you should've doneWell you might as well forget itIn the end you have wonLong-gone lettersWell it makes you feel betterNow you spend your days calmBut you spend the night shatteredIt's a long time nowTo be left in no doubtIt's a long time changeDo you still feel the same?And you just can't shake that moodCause she's poisoned all your foodNow you're bogged down in those bluesAnd you just can't shake them looseIt's a long time comingIt's a long time nowTo be left in no doubtIt's a long time changeDo you still feel the same?Long time coming
