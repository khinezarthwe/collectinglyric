I step off the trainI'm walking down your street againAnd past your doorBut you don't live there anymoreIt's years since you've been thereNow you've disappeared somewhereLike outer spaceYou've found some better placeAnd I miss youLike the deserts miss the rainCould you be dead?You always were two steps aheadOf everyoneWe'd walk behind while you would runI look up at your houseAnd I can almost hear you shoutDown to meWhere I always used to beAnd I miss you -Like the deserts miss the rainBack on the trainI ask why did I come againCan I confessI've been hanging around your old address?And the years have provedTo offer nothing since you movedYou're long goneBut I can't move onAnd I miss you -Like the deserts miss the rainI step off the trainI'm walking down your street againAnd past your doorI guess you don't live there anymoreIt's years since you've been thereNow you've disappeared somewhereLike outer spaceYou've found some better placeAnd I miss you -Like the deserts miss the rainAnd I miss you -Like the deserts miss the rain (deserts miss the rain)
