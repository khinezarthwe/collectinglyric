You and I were two old and tortured soulsRepaired by our love of broken thingsIn a life, just some bodies growing oldNo fear of the end, of anythingWe're just ordinary people, you and meTime will turn us into statues, eventuallyWe got by, though we never needed muchA sliver of hope, no diamond ringsWe got high, it was heaven, it was hellFly over them with broken wingsWe're just ordinary people, you and meTime will turn us into statues, eventuallyOhhh, ohh...Just two ordinary people, you and meTime will turn us into statues, eventuallyOur bones forever in stoneA monumental lifeTo dust, as everything mustWe'll fade away in timeOhhh ohh ohh oh...We're just ordinary people, you and meTime will turn us into statues, eventuallyOhhh, ohh...Just two ordinary people, you and meOhhh, ohh...Time will turn us into statues, eventually.
