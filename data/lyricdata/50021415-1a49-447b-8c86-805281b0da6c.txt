Wake in a sweat againAnother day's been laid to wasteIn my disgraceStuck in my head againFeels like I'll never leave this placeThere's no escapeI'm my own worst enemyI've given upI'm sick of feelingIs there nothing you can say?Take this all awayI'm suffocatingTell me what the fuck is wrong with meI don't know what to takeThought I was focused, but I'm scaredI'm not preparedI hyperventilateLooking for help, somehow, somewhereAnd no one caresI'm my own worst enemyI've given upI'm sick of feelingIs there nothing you can say?Take this all awayI'm suffocatingTell me what the fuck is wrong with meGod!Put me out of my misery!Put me out of my misery!Put me out of my...Put me out of my fucking misery!I've given upI'm sick of feelingIs there nothing you can say?Take this all awayI'm suffocatingTell me what the fuck is wrong with me
