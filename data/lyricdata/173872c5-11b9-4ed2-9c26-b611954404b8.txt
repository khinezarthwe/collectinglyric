From the dust of which I cameTo dust I return againFrom my mother I am tornWith my brothers off the warWe escape before the dawnTry to outrun the sunTake my own life in my handsFearing God but never manTake my ancient hand, look me in the eyeLooking past the lines soon you'll see as IYou are young if you want you could be old if you tryI can show you how to live but you can't show me how to dieAs the sun stalks the skyI am not afraid to dieMy ear upon the groundFor the ironhorse's soundEncircle glowing rocksOne by one each chieftain talksTales of yore and bravest deedsCoveting their warrior creedMy hands will bridge the distance of beginning to the endThe time for learning ceases it was all wasted and spentFrom witch doctor to shaman, Kachina doll to chiefThe spirit knows what ails you, you beg for its reliefAll that I know, all that I say, my heart beats and my pulse drumsOut tribal rhythms pounding through the sky
