Angel eyes - am I deceived or did you sigh?For all I know you let you love lightShine on meAngel eyes - you never close, who's got the time?I can wait until your love lightShine on meAngel eyes - seems to me you fill the skiesI'm far below so let your love lightShine on meAngel eyes - on the wing and open wideNo matter how high the moonShine down on me
