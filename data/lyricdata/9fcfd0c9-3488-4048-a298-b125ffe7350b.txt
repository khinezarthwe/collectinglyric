I can remember the horses of the pastureMisty mornings and cool of the eveningsI can remember when the wind whistlesIn the corners of the houseI can feel the fear of the darkWhen shaking underMy little bed trying to squeezeThe pillow to my safetyRiding to the grain fieldsDays of childhood in my memoriesFlying over the hills unforgettableOver and over againIn my dreams I live againMy childhood life from night to nightI could wake with the smell of new-mown hayI could wake and taste the blood in my mouthI can feel the fear of the darkWhen shaking underMy little bed trying to squeezeThe pillow to my safetyRiding to the grain fieldsDays of childhood in my memoriesFlying over the hills unforgettableOver and over again
