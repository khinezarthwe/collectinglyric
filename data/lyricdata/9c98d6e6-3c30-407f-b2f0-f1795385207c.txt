I can take the rain on the roof of this empty houseThat don't bother meI can take a few tears now and then and just let them outI'm not afraid to cryEvery once in a while even though goin' on with you goneStill upsets meThere are days every now and again I pretend I'm okayBut that's not what gets meWhat hurts the most was being so closeAnd having so much to say (Much to say)And watchin' you walk away (Walk away)Never knowing what could have beenAnd not seein' that lovin' youIs what I was tryin' to doIt's hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I goBut I'm doin' itIt's hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I'm aloneStill harder gettin' up, gettin' dressed, livin' with this regretBut I know if I could do it overI would trade, give away all the words that I saved in my heartThat I left unspokenWhat hurts the most was being so closeAnd having so much to say (Much to say)And watchin' you walk away (Walk away)Never knowing what could have beenAnd not seein' that lovin' youIs what I was tryin' to doOho!Heyey!I'm not afraid to cry every once in a while even though goin on with you goneStill upsets meThere are days every now and again I pretend I'm okayBut that's not what gets meWhat hurts the most was being so closeAnd having so much to say (Much to say)And watchin' you walk away (Walk away)Never knowing what could have beenAnd not seein' that lovin' youIs what I was tryin' to doWhat hurts the most was being so closeAnd having so much to say (Much to say)And watchin' you walk away (Walk away)Never knowing what could have beenAnd not seein' that lovin' youIs what I was tryin' to do
