Here's the weight of the world on my shouldersHere's the weight of the world on my shouldersOn my shoulders!!!All alone I pierce the chainAnd on and on all the sting remainsAnd dying eyes consume me nowThe voice inside screams out loudI am focused on what I am afterThe key to the next open chapterCause I found a way to steal the sun from the skyLong live that day that I decided to fly from the insideEvery day a new deceptionPick your scene and take directionAnd on and on I search to connectBut I don't wear a mask and I have no regretsI am focused on what I am afterThe key to the next open chapterCause I found a way to steal the sun from the skyLong live that day that I decided to fly from the insideI can't escape the painI can't control the rageSometimes I think that I'm gonna go insaneI'm not against what's rightI'm not for what's wrongI'm just making my way and I'm goneHere's the weight of the world on my shouldersCause I found a way to steal the sun from the skyLong live that day that I decided to fly from the insideThat I decided to fly from the insideThat I decided to fly from the inside
