In the end we tend to think of how itbeganI could never explain the picture it painted,and how it made me feelNow the ceiling is in motionThe light centered and overlookedYou want to see me disappear? Well, so do ISuch a quiet evaporationWe're nothing but hollow vessels in searchof what makes us aliveI never said this was my revolution whenyou looked me in the eyeOh, how I've walked this white line somany times beforeWhat a feeble attempt just to feel aliveThis is for you and your hopeless caseYou never would leave me in your wish tofail every timeEvery time I trySo talk about itAt least it makes you feel something insideWho have I becomeOh God, everything all around me iscrumbling at my feetI stare so delicate and ashamedat the shell I've shed myself fromIn the eyes of my ghostand I will never look back again
