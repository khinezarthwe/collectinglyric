This song will become the anthem of your undergroundYou're two floors down getting high in the back room.If I flooded out your house,Do you think you'd make it out?Or would you burn up before the water filled your lungs?And at your funeral,I will sing the requiemThis song will become the anthem of your undergroundYou're two floors down getting high in the back room.If I flooded out your house, do you think you'd make it out?Or would you burn up before the water fills your lungs?And at your funeral,I will sing the requiemI'd offer you my handIt would hurt too much to watch you dieAnd you can bet when we mourn the death of you that night (of you that night)They'll lay me on the dinner tableI will be the pigWith the apple in my mouthThe food that celebrates your endAnd at your funeral,I will sing the requiemI'd offer you my handIt would hurt too much to watch you dieAnd at your funeral I will sing the requiemI'd offer you my handIt would hurt too much to watch you die
