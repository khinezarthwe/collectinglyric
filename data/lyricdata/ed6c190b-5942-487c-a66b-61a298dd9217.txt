You left your opening open wideAnd you let everyone come insideThere's always something you've got to hideSo you lied, and you lied, and you liedMake sure you grab everything that you needYou've got a hole that you've got to feedYou try to fill it all up with your greedBut it bleeds, and it bleeds, and it bleedsGot take a little moreWe'll scrape you off the floorWe love you anyhowBut you're not so pretty nowA great big superstarIs what you think you areWe love you anyhowBut you're not so pretty nowNobody burns quite as brightWell goddamn, maybe you're rightThere's always battles there for you to fightAnd you might, you might, you just mightBut there is something I gotta sayThere is a price you know you payTry as hard as you can to stayHe's just fading, and fading, and fading the fuck awayGo take a little moreWe'll scrape you off the floorWe love you anyhowBut you're not so pretty nowA great big superstarIs what you think you areWe love you anyhowBut you're not so pretty nowBetter turn the lights down lowThe cracks begin to showWe love you anyhowBut you're not so pretty nowAnd soon you will be goneAnd we will all move onYou never mattered anyhowAnd you're not so pretty now
