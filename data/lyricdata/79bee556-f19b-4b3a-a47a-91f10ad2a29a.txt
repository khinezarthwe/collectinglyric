It seems like I've been here before tonightIt seems like I've been here beforeI'd like to TV, talk, and advertiseWe peddle candy door to doorAnd hold tight; don't make more plansAnd don't talk; don't say no wordsAnd be still; now move like thisAnd hold on; until we kissAnd hold onAnd hold tightAnd hold onAnd hold tightWhy do the good things happen in the past?Streamline the news and trim the fatI love the city but I hate my jobAnd this old city loves me backIt's like a scream inside a screamThey can trace it through the night into the churchIt seems it's never going to endUntil our life cuts through the air into the wombAnd hold onAnd hold tightAnd hold onAnd hold tightAnd hold onAnd hold tightAnd hold onAnd hold tightIt's like a scream inside a screamIt seems it's never going to endIt's like a scream inside a screamIt seems it's never going to endAnd hold tight; don't say no wordsAnd don't talk; give me no wordAnd be still; now move like thisAnd hold on; until the kissAnd hold onAnd hold tightAnd hold onAnd hold tightAnd hold onAnd hold tightAnd hold onAnd hold tight
