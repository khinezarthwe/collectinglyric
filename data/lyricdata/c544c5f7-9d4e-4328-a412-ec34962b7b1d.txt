I'm either dreaming too much, or not dreaming at allIt's not a flaw I'm just emotionalAnd if there's one thing I know, it's that I want some candyMade specially to be the flavor of the taste of your mouthI try to identify the taste of your mouthBut there's no comparison to think aboutSo I'm bracing myself for these hours apartBut when I see you again, I'm gonna want to taste the taste of your mouthI want the taste of your mouth I want the taste of your mouthI want the taste in my mouth to be the taste of your mouthI want the taste of your mouth I want the taste of your mouthI want the taste in my mouth to be the taste of your mouthI want the taste of your mouth I want the taste of your mouthI want the taste in my mouth to be the taste of your mouthI want the taste of your mouth I want the taste of your mouthI want the taste in my mouth to be the taste of your mouth
