Don't wanna be wrapped up in a flagOr spill blood upon the sandNo don't wanna die for some pack of liesOr a dream that they made in a roomBut I would die for loveYes I would kneel at your doorYeah I would die for loveLove, love loveSome people will stick you in the eyeAnd try to burn you up insideYou don't have to pray for the death of your enemiesYou'll defeat them with a songYeah I would die for loveYes I would kneel at your doorYeah I would die for loveIf the voices of fearCould be banished far from hereIn my darkness and painThere's a song of yesterdayBut I would die for loveYes I would kneel at your doorOh I would die for loveLove
