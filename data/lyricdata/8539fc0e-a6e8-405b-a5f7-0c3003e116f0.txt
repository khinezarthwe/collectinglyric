Why, am I treated so bad?Why, am I treated so bad?You know I'm all alone as I sing this song,Hear my call, I've done nobody wrongBut I'm treated so badI'm gonna walk out in the Master's nameThings I do, they seem to be in vainYou may be blind, you may be lame,Walk on out in the Master's nameThough they treat me so badOoh ooh ooh oooooohOoh ooh ooh ooooooohOooh ooh ooh oooooh ooh  ooh oohhhYou may be blind, you may be lameWalk on out in the Master's nameThough they treat me so bad
