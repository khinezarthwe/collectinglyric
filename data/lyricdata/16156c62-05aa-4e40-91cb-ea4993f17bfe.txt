I know, I know she came to save you,But she knocked my drink over too.And I know, I know that she wants you,She looks at you the way that I do.Well if you think that I'm lying,Why would I give up trying so soon?Where'd you go, where'd you go,Where'd you leave me of my soul?Where'd you go?And how's it now, how's it now, how's it back in London Town,Where you let me down?And I know, I know what you've been through,You think I don't care but I really do.And I know, I know that it hurts you,But you'd be pleased that she is,Now what would you do?Well if you think that I'm lying,Why would I give up trying so soon?Where'd you go, where'd you go,Where'd you leave me of my soul?Where'd you go?How's it now, how's it now, how's it back in London Town,Where you let me down?And it's all of bad things,I wish I hadn't done.I know your rule about the dancing,But I, I just don't find it fun.Would you care if i cared to?Would you run from you?Where'd you go, where'd you go,Where'd you leave me of my soul?Where'd you go?And how's it now, how's it now, how's it back in London Town,Where you let me down?
