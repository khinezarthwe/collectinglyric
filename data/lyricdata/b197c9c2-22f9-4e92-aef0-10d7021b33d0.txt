I got magic in my head, magic up my nose, magic coming out my fingers, magic crying out my eyes. I've got magic everywhere I fucking look. I can't fight it either, I wish I could.Step foot downHold him to the groundWhine though he may, you've got some bills to payIt's all I've ever known it's everything until I say so, you say "so say so."Okay, I've got lots of friendsin rather dry placesI've got lots of pills in my pocketIf you want some, I'd like to shareWith you and everyone that you care about.But I don't know what to do for you?Do you careI don't know what's best for youSick and dyingI've been spending all my timeSleeping of concious debtsand licking bags clean of everything I loveand anything I can carry aroundI'm a restless ratstrun up and burnt out.Losing my fur to the windCatching looks from baby, white miceBastards in a black weeping vice.But sometimes, the sunlightIt just won't let me cryWhen leaves tickle my arms I can't help but let my mouth sing.Sing out words of trustIn a language I still don't comprehendWhat does meaning mend in the end?I don't know what to do for youI don't know what's best for youI don't know what to do for youI don't know what's best for youBut sometimes, the sunlightIt just won't let me cryWhen leaves tickle my arms I can't help but let my mouth sing.Sing out words of trustIn a language I still don't comprehendWhat does meaning mend in the end?In the end
