[Limited Edition bonus track]Worming through the markOf Ezekiel and MarkThrough the chapters of HonoriusGilles, as in a tranceScrewed the pages up and dancedCourting something vainly gloriousHe walked he gravest nightThat decrepit final junctureOf doom and negativityReeking of deathAnd the gloom of Stygian lightWhen suddenly, the faintest whisper!A curtain opened in a painted vistaMoonbeams swept into his dream...Balsamic and anathemaBalsamic and anathemaPrelati full of starsMagical, ecstatic starsThat sparkled, no debacle sought to douseHis fiery omnipresenceHissed at heaven, evanescentHe was there to thwart the burning of his FaustThe gates were prised, the phantom horsesSnorted, restless to be goneWith enchantment's eyes upon the door, he cried-'Come with me now!'Gilles balked, the thought of lifeAccused and pursuedAnd overridden by morbiditySaddened his breathFor those destined for his knifeThen suddenly - the strangest feelingOne that left the angels reelingAtonement crept into his midstBalsamic and anathemaBalsamic and anathemaPrelati, full of starsThis abductor of his heartPromised him horizons free of painBut all the grand designsMagic sings and midnight winesIn the dream-world couldn't hope to swerve his aimHe would stay and face his slayersCardinals and courtroom playersWhilst Prelati must now flee beforeThe pure and azure dawn...The gates were wide, the phantom horsesSnorted, restless to be goneWith enchantment's eyes upon the doorOnce more he cried'Come with me now!'Prelati full of starsTried to pull him from the danceSummoning his Barron to performBut as the Demon roseIn sweet miracles of proseAnd propaganda, came a proper bible stormLightning - grinning, frozeOn this murder-site of crowsAnd from the scattered ashes stepped a sylphThe maiden Joan of ArcCrept more beautiful and darkA paradise, a cradle free of filthShe was chaste beyond all gracesThe face of faith illuminatedMore precious than Prelati's spellA Goddess in a dream...And trembling in her armHer eyes a thousand golden psalmsThat glittered as on Christmas nightHe wept like Hallowe'enHe held the scene, the poignant gleamOf peace and great serenityClose to his heart, her parting kissHe slept to wake released in bliss
