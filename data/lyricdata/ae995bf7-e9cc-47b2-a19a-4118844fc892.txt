And it starts, sometime around midnightOr at least that's when you lose yourselfFor a minute or twoAs you stand, under the bar lightsAnd the band plays some songAbout forgetting yourself for a whileAnd the piano's this melancholy soundtrack to her smileAnd that white dress she's wearingYou haven't seen her for a whileBut you know that she's watchingShe's laughing, she's turningShe's holding her tonic like a crossThe room's suddenly spinningShe walks up and asks how you areSo you can smell her perfumeYou can see her lying naked in your armsAnd so there's a change, in your emotionsAnd all these memories come rushingLike feral waves to your mindOf the curl of your bodiesLike two perfect circles entwinedAnd you feel hopeless and homelessAnd lost in the haze of the wineThen she leaves, with someone you don't knowBut she makes sure you saw herShe looks right at you and boltsAs she walks out the doorYour blood boilingYour stomach in ropesOh and when your friends say,"What is it? You look like you've seen a ghost."Then you walk, under the streetlightsAnd you're too drunk to noticeThat everyone is staring at youYou just don't care what you look likeThe world is falling around youYou just have to see herYou just have to see herYou just have to see herYou just have to see herYou just have to see herYou know that she'll break you in two
