Black is blackI want my baby back.It's grey, it's grey,Since she went awayOh-oh, what can I do??'cause I-I-I-I-I,I'm feelin' blue.If I had my way,She'd be back today.But she don't need timeTo see me again.Oh-oh, what can I do'cause I-I-I-I-I,I'm feelin' blue.I can't choose,It's too much to loseMy love's too strong.Maybe sheWould come back to meWhat did I do wrong?Bad is bad,This fella is so sad.It's time, it's time,That I found peace of mind.Oh-oh, what can I do'cause I-I-I-I-I,I'm feelin' blue.I can't choose,It's too much to loseMy love's too strong.Maybe sheWould come back to meWhat did I do wrong?Black is blackI want my baby back.It's gray, it's gray,Since she went awayOh-oh, what can I do'cause I-I-I-I-I,I'm feelin' blue.'cause I-I-I-I-I,I'm feelin' blue...
