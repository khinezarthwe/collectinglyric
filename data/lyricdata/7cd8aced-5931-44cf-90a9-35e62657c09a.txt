Well, lived my life and never stopped to worry 'bout a thingOpened up and shouted out and never tried to singWondering if I'd done wrongWill this depression last for long?Won't you tell meWhere have all the good times gone?Where have all the good times gone?Well, once we had an easy ride and always felt the sameTime was on my side and I had everything to gainLet it be like yesterdayPlease let me have happy daysWon't you tell meWhere have all the good times gone?Where have all the good times gone?Ma and Pa look back at all the things they used to doDidn't have no money and they always told the truthDaddy didn't have no toysAnd mummy didn't need no boysWon't you tell meWhere have all the good times gone?Where have all the good times gone?Well, yesterday was such an easy game for you to playBut let's face it things are so much easier todayGuess you need some bringing downAnd get your feet back on the groundWon't you tell meWhere have all the good times gone?Where have all the good times gone?Where have all the good times gone?
