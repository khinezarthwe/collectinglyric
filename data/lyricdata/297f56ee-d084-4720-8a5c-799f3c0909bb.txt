Names that sound familiarSecret wounds from failureTry and look into their eyesA part of the weekend never diesThere's no tension in your danceAs you try and hold my handIt's not you it's the e-talkingClosing in on the translationIt's not you it's the e-talkingI'm not sure which part I'm playingLook and I come in betweenFaces you have never seenSilence re-alarms go wildRock stop paint me melt to lieAs you weep things work the sameBut I can't recall your nameIt's not you it's the e-talkingClosing in on the translationIt's not you it's the e-talkingI'm not sure which part I'm playingStranger at your ownParty feels like homeLate night phonecallsTry to please allIt's not you it's the e-talkingClosing in on the translationIt's not you it's the e-talkingI'm not sure which part I'm playing
