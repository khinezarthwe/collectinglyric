I watched her sleep from the driver's seatAnd she turned into an ocean spitting fish into my seaOh, how she flickered to remain so young and innocently sweetAnd how the secrets in her belly wrestle softly for her keepingLike the ring that left her finger greenAnd the knife that sent her shivering body freeOh, like a knot she tied so sweetly around meWe were aware of our bounderiesSomeday I'll meet you on a telephone wireWon't have to love you through a prayerI can just touch you with my eyesAnd we will talk about the world just as if we were still aliveAnd you will rest within my feathersAnd I will take you for the keepingAnd you will fly so sweetly around meAnd you will teach me to fly so sweetly around youAnd if you talk to Jesus, ask Him if He wants me to come homeIf He says He's seen us changing all His plans to suit our ownWill you apologize or stand behind the selfish moves we've madeWhile learning life is strange and people change and circle round again
