I don't feel like John Belushi tonightPoor little me I'm switching out my lightsI've had a busy week and I'd like to ease my brainYou can take drugs if you want, but I'm taking a rain - check me outI'm not wired at all tonightI'm not wired at all tonightI'm not wired at all tonightI don't feel like freaking out with your friendsThey're nice enough people, but the good times have to endAnd I warned you that the slow time was coming soonTonight I'm laying down in a smoky darkened roomWell, looky hereI'm not wired at all tonightI'm not wired at all tonightI'm not wired at all tonightDon't feel like getting high this timeYou go ahead I just need to rest my mindI don't need that buzzing in my earI listen to my heart and baby it's bringing a tear to my eyeI'm not wired at all tonightI'm not wired at all tonightI'm not wired at all tonight
