I look out my window watch her as she passes byI say to myself I'm such a lucky guyTo have a girl like her is a dream come trueAnd of all the girls in New York she loves me trueIt was just my imagination, once againRunning away with meIt was just my imaginationRunning away with meSoon we'll be married and raise a familyTwo boys for you, what about two girls for meI tell you I am just a fellow with a one track mindWhatever it is I want baby I seek and I shall findI'll tell yaIt was just my imagination, once againRunning away with meIt was just my imaginationRunning away with meEvery night I hope and pray"Dear lord, hear my pleaDon't ever let another take her love from meOr I will surely die"Her love is ecstasyWhen her arms enfold meI hear her tender rhapsodyBut in reality, she doesn't even know... me
