It's that ancient loveThat you won't outgrowIt's the fee you payIt's the debt you oweIt's that subtle wayThat you throw me downAnd i'm inches aboveThe dust on the groundI await your callI await your crownLet's change our roadsAnd chase them all aroundIt's a subtle wayThat you throw me downAnd i'm inches aboveThe dust on the groundAnd all is quietAll is quiet nowAnd all is silentAll is silent nowNo i don't hide itI don't hide it nowIt's that ancient loveThat just moves alongThere's an itch so slightEven when you're goneWell i met you rightBut i kept you wrongAnd i must wait until i've found the groundThat you are walking onAnd all is quietAll is quiet nowAnd all is silentAll is silent nowNo i don't hide itI don't hide it nowNo i don't hide itI don't hide it now
