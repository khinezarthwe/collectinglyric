I don't think that it'sGonna rain again todayThere's a devil at your sideBut an angel on the waySomeone hit the light'Cause there's more here to be seenWhen you caught my eyeI saw everywhere I'd beenAnd wanna go toYou came on your ownThat's how you'll leaveWith hope in your handsAnd air to breatheI won't disappoint youAs you fall apartSome things should be simpleEven an end has a startSomeone hit the light'Cause there's more here to be seenWhen you caught my eyeI saw everywhere I'd beenAnd wanna go toYou came on your ownThat's how you'll leaveWith hope in your handsAnd air to breatheYou'll lose everythingBy the endStill my broken limbsYou find time to mendMore and more people IKnow are getting illPull something good from theAshes, now be stillYou came on your ownThat's how you'll leaveWith hope in your handsAnd air to breatheYou'll lose everythingBy the endStill my broken limbsYou choose to mendYou came on your ownThat's how you'll leaveYou came on your ownThat's how you'll leaveYou came on your ownYou came on your own
