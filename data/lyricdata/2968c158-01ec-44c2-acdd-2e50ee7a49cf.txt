No more tearsNo more cryin'No more sighin', lyin' or dyin'No more HIVNo more tweakin'No more drugs or immune systems being weakenedJust happy times and half assed rhymes and mimesBecause mimes are dearsBut most of all I want no more tearsNo more bad timesNo more bummersNo more SUVs and no more HummersNo more racismNo more discriminationNo more fat dumb fucks keeping people out of our nationWe're all one big band across this land and we should sing in tuneLet us grow the balls to break the wallsWe've got to do it soonBut most of all I want no more tearsNo more cryin'No more sighin', lyin' or dyin'
