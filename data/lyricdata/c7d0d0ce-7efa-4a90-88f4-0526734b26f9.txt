I asked the world a questionWhen did you begin?I asked him of his problemsWhen did you go wrong?My singing cells have powerAn army by my sideYou so want my mindYou trick my timeAnd I run around and you're on your ownWithout with without you say at home at homeHow hard do you make it go?No mothers and fathers to make us anymoreNo arms or eyes to shape usLike life itselfThen a thousand red coats scorn meYou so want my mindYou trick my timeAnd I run around and you're on your ownWithout with without you say at home at homeHow hard do you make it go?You so want my mindYou trick my timeAnd I run around and you're on your ownWithout with without you say at home at homeHow hard do you make it go?It's just a memoryBillions and billions of lights and heartsBefalling to embers through to coalSave from dust to dustTo wind to desert to deathI asked the world a questionWhen did you begin?I asked him of his problemsWhen did you go wrong?Those lead you who wake from the dreams which lies and shapes the farm in their eyes
