Trembling like a fly all tangled in a web unseenFeeling like I'm always falling backwards in the dreamAround me all the holy men were kneeling on the floorAsking for forgiveness, they would wait forever moreA cool wind blows on byThe spider and the flyIn the dying light I saw a child there so fairBending through the shadows as she moved up through the airI could hear her voice as it came calling through the darkThough I never found her, I have held her in my heartA cool wind blows on byThe spider and the flyI could always feel you here with me, forming all the words I ever speakSeeing everything that will ever be, through meOver all the years now I have always heard this songIt sings me off to sleep and then it wakes me in the dawnIt was such a mystery I pondered all the timeOne day without warning it came forming in my mindA cool wind blows on byThe spider and the fly
