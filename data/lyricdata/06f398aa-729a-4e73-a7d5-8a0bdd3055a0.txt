A desperate situationForced to retaliationThe task ahead a burdenMen will suffer, that's for certainWe'll charge into the fireThe cause, we must inspireWe raise our fists to tyrannyA high price, freedom is not freeThe odds are stacked against usBut with our resolve relentlessAnd arrogance their weaknessOur cause is just, we won't be beatenUpon this declarationWill come a brand new nationWhere men are seen as equalGoverned by and for the peopleChorus:So we make our stand and prayOn this declaration dayFor independence I will fightWith liberty I will defySo we make our stand and prayOn this declaration dayGive me liberty or give me deathI'll fight 'till my last breathWith virtue as our beaconOur cause is charged as treasonBattle worn and starvingThrough the hell of war we'll keep marchingThe birth of our new nationAn act of desperationWe'll force King George down to his kneesCapitulationChorus
