Silent night, broken nightAll is fallen when you take your flightI found some hate for youJust for showYou found some love for meThinking I'd goDon't keep me from crying to sleepSleep in heavenly peaceSilent night, moonlit nightNothing's changedNothing is rightI should be stronger than weeping aloneYou should be weaker than sending me homeI can't stop you fighting to sleepSleep in heavenly peace
