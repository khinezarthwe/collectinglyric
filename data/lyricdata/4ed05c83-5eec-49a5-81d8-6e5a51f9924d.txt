Girl and the SeaTonight theTonight the hills are watching herAs she runs towards the seaYeah she runs so she'll be freeAnd of all the friends and enemies she’s made along the wayThey are no where in her thoughtsAs she dives beneath the wavesAnd he's the one that you've seen sometimes on TVAnd his shirt is on the groundWhile he's tackled by policeAnd the parcel that he throws across the bridge into the creekIt'll flow towards the seaIt will meet with her tomorrowNo place,Some timeWe'll clearOur eyesAnd whenYou're downI'll come aroundAnd all thePlaces she’s been along the wayFlames are licking at their wallsNight glows with their remainsFrom far away the animals come gather round to seeBut she knows not how they feelAnd she knows not what it meansWhen she was young we'd ask her what she'd like to beAnd she'd close her eyes and dream......now we're no where in her thoughtsAs she dives beneath the waves.A placeI've foundCould beAll oursBut I’ve seenWhere youWould rather be.
