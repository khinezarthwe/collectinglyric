We had fun in the sunBut now you've thrown it awayTossing out the baby with the bathtubThese dogs have strayedYou'll never know how hard I triedTo keep my worries in lineBut they're all bastardsGone are the good old daysOf painting young Courtney PineListened to the taunts and the shoutsOf celebration wineI never could make it work out rightHer milk glows in the black lightBut it don't matterBecause no one comes out to see usNo one comes out to see usNo one comes out to see usWell, my pain's in a ruttI've been lonely enoughI've bled Los Angeles bloodI've had enough of this stuffYou can't go on with what you're doingBecause you already know howYou run your life into ruinThere's so much to showYou'll never know how hard I triedHer milk glows in the black lightBut it don't matterBecause no one comes out to see usNo one comes out to see usNo one comes out to see usWell, my pain's in a ruttI've been lonely enoughI've bled Los Angeles bloodI've had enough of this stuffNo one comes out to see usNo one comes out to see usNo one comes out to see us(Her milk glows in the black light)No one comes out to see us(Her milk glows in the black light)(All the same life is burning forever)(All the same life is (???))
