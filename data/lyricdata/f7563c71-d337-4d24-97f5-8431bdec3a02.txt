Me and all my friendsWe're all misunderstoodThey say we stand for nothingAnd there's no way we ever couldNow we see everything that's going wrongWith the world and those who lead itWe just feel like we don't have the meansTo rise above and beat itSo we keep waitingWaiting on the world to changeWe keep on waitingWaiting on the world to changeIt's hard to beat the systemWhen we're standing at a distanceSo we keep waitingWaiting on the world to changeNow, if we had the powerTo bring our neighbors home from warThey would have never missed a ChristmasNo more ribbons on their doorAnd when you trust your televisionWhat you get is what you got'Cause when they own the informationThey can bend it all they wantThat's why we're waitingWaiting on the world to changeWe keep on waitingWaiting on the world to changeIt's not that we don't care,We just know that the fight ain't fairSo we keep on waitingWaiting on the world to changeWe're still waitingWaiting on the world to changeWe keep on waitingWaiting on the world to changeOne day our generationIs gonna rule the populationSo we keep on waitingWaiting on the world to changeWe keep on waitingWaiting on the world to change
