Tension... like wire... on schizophren streetA man like fire... keeping it discreetAge of madness... closing into viewCorruption of the dearest... ache the bones inside youFeel like you're being usedThe cloning of the all abusedA new addition to the rest of themIn the age of madnessClosing in on youScared of the silence... I am the meaninglessScared of the violence... I am invertebrateFeel like you're being usedThe cloning of the all abusedA new addition to the rest of themIn the age of madnessClosing in on youSo cry like the rain... to lose the pain of a lifetimeThat takes you years to find... with holes left in your mindTo let the loser out... try to start againStart again... start again... With no-one to blame but yourselfAge of madness... you're not wrong, you're just outnumberedAge of madness... seasons in the ever underFeel like you're being usedThe cloning of the all abusedA new addition to the rest of themFeel like you're being usedLooking sussed, but you're confusedThe new addition to the rest of themIn the age of madness
