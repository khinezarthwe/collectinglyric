Clean sheets mean a lot to a guy who sleeps on the floorI whited your love, and a shelf in your dresser drawerYou tucked me in, stopped my tossing and turningBut I turned back the covers and saw those sheets are dirtyEven thought you'll never come cleanYou know it's trueThose sheets are dirtyAnd so are youThe warmth of a bed to a guy who sleeps on the floorWas enough to perpetuate all the lies I heard beforeI want to hold you, I'll hold my pillow insteadCause my pillow will never lie or be with a stranger in my bedWhere's the love I was looking forIt's out the doorI'm afraid to see you anymoreSo it's back on the floorCause those sheets are dirtyWoke up this morning alone on the floorThinking about those clean sheets and the way it was beforeWhen I looked in the mirror, I saw your face and thought of the pastBut now I know how dirty you are, I took my fist and smashed the glassThose sheets are dirtyThose sheets are dirtyThose sheets are dirty
