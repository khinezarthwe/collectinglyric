Where have all good men gone and where are all the gods?Where's the streetwise Hercules to fight the rising odds?Isn't there a white knight upon a fiery steed?Late at night, I toss and I turn and I dream of what I needI need a heroI'm holding out for a hero till the end of the nightHe's gotta be strong, and he's gotta be fast, and he's gotta be fresh from the fightI need a heroI'm holding out for a hero till the morning lightHe's gotta be sure, and it's gotta be soon, and he's gotta be larger than lifeLarger than lifeSomewhere after midnight in my wildest fantasySomewhere just beyond my reach there's someone reaching back for meRacing on the thunder and rising with the heatIt's gonna take a Superman to sweep me off my feetI need a heroI'm holding out for a hero till the end of the nightHe's gotta be strong, and he's gotta be fast, and he's gotta be fresh from the fightI need a heroI'm holding out for a hero till the morning lightHe's gotta be sure, and it's gotta be soon, and he's gotta be larger than lifeI need a heroI'm holding out for a hero till the end of the nightUp where the mountains meet the heavens aboveOut where the lightning splits the seaI could swear there is someone, somewhere, watching meThrough the wind and the chill and the rainAnd the storm and the floodI can feel his approach like a fire in my bloodI need a heroI'm holding out for a hero till the end of the nightHe's gotta be strong, and he's gotta be fast, and he's gotta be fresh from the fightI need a heroI'm holding out for a hero till the morning lightHe's gotta be sure, and it's gotta be soon, and he's gotta be larger than lifeI need a heroI'm holding out for a hero till the end of the night
