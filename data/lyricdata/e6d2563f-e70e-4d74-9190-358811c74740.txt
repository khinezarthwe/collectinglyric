Whoa, thought it was a nightmare,Lo, it's all so true,They told me, "Don't go walkin' slow'Cause Devil's on the loose."[Chorus:]Better run through the jungle,Better run through the jungle,Better run through the jungle,Woa, Don't look back to see.Thought I heard a rumblin'Callin' to my name,Two hundred million guns are loadedSatan cries, "Take aim!"[Chorus]Over on the mountainThunder magic spoke,"Let the people know my wisdom,Fill the land with smoke."[Chorus]
