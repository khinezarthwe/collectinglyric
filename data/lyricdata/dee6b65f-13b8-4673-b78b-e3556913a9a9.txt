Time stands still, all I can feel is the time standing stillAs you put down the keys and say 'don't call me please', while the radio plays"I Think I Need a New Heart", oh"I Think I Need a New Heart", ohYou've lied, too, but it's a sin that I can't tell the truthCause it all comes out wrong unless I put it in a song, so the radio plays"I Think I Need a New Heart", just for you"I Think I Need a New Heart"Cause I always say "I love you", when I mean "turn out the light"And I say "let's run away", when I just mean "stay the night"But the words you want to hear, you will never hear from meI'll never say "happy anniversary"; never stay to say "happy anniversary"So I think I need a new heart, ohI think I need a new heart, ohI think I need a new heart, ohI think I need a new heart, ohGive me time
