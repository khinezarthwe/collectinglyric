Your hair reminds me of a time when were we once wereYour fingernails that marked my back now rot in earthThe sheets we slept in blew away, and now the storm is overThe taste of you inside my mouth remains, but still I'm hearingThere's no love, everybody's cryingThere's no truth, everyone's misguidedAnd now the end is here!There's no more pills to swallowThe bitter taste I feel, won't lead me to tomorrowYour scent reminds me of a place we used to goThe kisses placed upon my neck show signs of, no return!The bed we fucked in, smells the same, and now the the stench is fadingThe taste of you inside my mouth remains but still I'm hearingThere's no love, everybody's cryingThere's no truth, everyone's misguidedAnd now the end is here!There's no more pills, to swallow!The bitter taste I feel, won't lead me to, tomorrow!Cries for anger,Lies for powerFighting for nothing, is what you were born forCries for anger,Lies for powerFighting for nothing, is what you were born forAHH!YAAH!Cries for anger,Lies for powerFighting for nothing, is what you were born forCries for anger,Lies for powerFighting for nothing, is what you were born, for!
