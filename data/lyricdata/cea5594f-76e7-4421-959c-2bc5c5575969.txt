I've been down andI'm wondering whyThese little black cloudsKeep walking aroundWith meWith meIt wastes timeAnd I'd rather be highThink I'll walk me outsideAnd buy a rainbow smileBut they're freeThey're all freeSo maybe tomorrowI'll find my way homeSo maybe tomorrowI'll find my way homeI look around at a beautiful lifeBeen the upper side of downBeen the inside of outBut we breatheWe breatheI wanna breeze and an open mindI wanna swim in the oceanWanna take my time for meAll meSo maybe tomorrowI'll find my way homeSo maybe tomorrowI'll find my way homeSo maybe tomorrowI'll find my way homeSo maybe tomorrowI'll find my way homeSo maybe tomorrowI'll find my way homeSo maybe tomorrowI'll find my way home
