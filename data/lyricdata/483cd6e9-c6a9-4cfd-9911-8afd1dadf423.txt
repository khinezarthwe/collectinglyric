I get upWhen I'm downI can't swimBut my soul won't drownI do believeI got flareI got speedAnd I walk on airCos God gimme soul in your rock 'n' roll, babeCos God gimme soul in your rock 'n' roll, babeAnd I get so high I just can't feel itAnd I get so high I just can't feel itIn and out my brain, runnin' through my veinYou're my sunshine, you're my rainThere's a loveThat shines onShines on meAnd it keeps me warmIt gimme peaceI must sayI can't sleepCos the world won't waitCos God gimme soul in your rock 'n' roll, babeCos God gimme soul in your rock 'n' roll, babeAnd I get so high I just can't feel itAnd I get so high I just can't feel itIn and out my brain, runnin' through my veinYou're my sunshine, you're my rainAnd I get so high I just can't feel itAnd I get so high I just can't feel itAnd I get so high I just can't feel itAnd I get so high I just can't feel itIn and out my brain, runnin' through my veinYou're my sunshine, you're my rain
