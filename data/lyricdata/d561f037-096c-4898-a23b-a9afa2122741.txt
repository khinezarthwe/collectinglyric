You talked me to sleep last nightI hadn't felt that sad in yearsYour eyes like glass mistakesThey moved me close to tearsYou speak those favourite fables which I'm yet to liveAnd casually confirm my fearsThat I've got nothing to giveI wish I could say that I've got no regretsBut saying that would be one more to pile on my deskI wish I could say I've clung to time like goldBut as you said goodbye, I almost diedI almost diedI take it back, all of itThose names I called myselfThe heroes of my childhoodLike hardbacks on the shelfI take it back, those promises I made to everyoneI'm falling through a ribbon lastBefore I'd learnt to runI wish I could say that I've got no regretsBut saying that would be one more to pile on my deskI wish I could say I've clung to time like goldBut as you said goodbye, I almost diedI almost diedI almost died
