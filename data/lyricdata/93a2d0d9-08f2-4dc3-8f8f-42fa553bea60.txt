You can keep what you wantI want none of thisThey're just bad memoriesI don't wantIn the sunshineYou can pack it all upAnd be goneAnd be goneIf it matters to youYou can sell it all upIf the price feels rightI won't judgeIf you get off your kneesYou'll be out on the breezeTake a lesson from meDon't get stuck on a dream
