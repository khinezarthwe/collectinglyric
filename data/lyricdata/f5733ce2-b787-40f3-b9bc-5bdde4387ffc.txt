Sometimes I doubt the path I choseSometimes my dreams feel all on holdThere's no doubt that this will make me strongBecause it's the hardest thing I've ever doneDespite this cruel worldAnd all my best effortsYou surprise me withJust how perfect you areEven with all my flawsAnd my bad examplesYou surprise me withJust how perfect you areAnd when I'm lostYou search for meAnd when I doubtYou're my beliefI'm suppose to beThe stronger oneYou always seemTo prove that theory wrongStill, I hold my breath each time you goOut in the world that's beyond my controlIf you are dreamingI never want to wake you upDespite this cruel worldAnd all my best effortsYou surprise me withJust how perfect you areEven with all my flawsAnd my bad examplesYou surprise me withJust how perfect you areWhen I'm all in a spinFull of cynicismYou remind me ofJust how perfect you areWhen I'm at my witâ€™s endAnd I'm losing my headYou remind me ofJust how lucky I am
