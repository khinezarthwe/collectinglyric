As I sit in this smokey roomThe night about to endI pass my time with strangersBut this bottle's my only friendRemember when we used to parkOn Butler Street out in the darkRemember when we lost the keysAnd you lost more than that in my backseat, babyRemember when we used to talkAbout busting out - we'd break their heartsTogether - foreverNever say goodbye, never say goodbyeYou and me and my old friendsHoping it would never endNever say goodbye, never say goodbyeHoldin' on - we got to tryHoldin' on to never say goodbyeRemember days of skipping schoolRacing cars and being coolWith a six pack and the radioWe didn't need no place to goRemember at the prom that nightYou and me we had a fightBut the band they played our favorite songAnd I held you in my arms so strongWe danced so closeWe danced so slowAnd I swore I'd never let you goTogether - foreverNever say goodbye, never say goodbyeYou and me and my old friendsHoping it would never endSay goodbye, never say goodbyeHoldin' on - we got to tryHoldin' on to never say goodbyeI guess you'd say we used to talkAbout busting outWe'd break their heartsTogether - foreverNever say goodbye, never say goodbyeYou and me and my old friendsHoping it would never endSay goodbye, never say goodbyeHoldin' on - we got to tryHoldin' on to never say goodbye
