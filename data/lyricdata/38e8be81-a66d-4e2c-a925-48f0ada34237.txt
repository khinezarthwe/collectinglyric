As your body floats down Third StreetWith the burn-smell factory closing upYes it's sad to say you will romanticizeAll the things you've known beforeIt was not not not so greatIt was not not not so greatAnd as you take a bath in that beaten pathThere's a pounding at the doorWell It's a mighty zombie talking of some love and posterityHe says "The good old days never say good-byeIf you keep this in your mind:You need some lo-lo-loving armsYou need some lo-lo-loving arms"And as you fall from grace the only words you say arePut your hand inside the puppet headPut your hand inside the puppet headPut your hand insidePut your hand insidePut your hand inside the puppet headAds up in the subway are the work of someoneTrying to please their bossAnd though the guy's a pig we all know what he wantsIs just to please somebody elseIf the pu-pu-puppet headWas only bu-bu-busted inIt would be a better thing for everyone involvedAnd we wouldn't have to cryPut your hand inside the puppet headPut your hand inside the puppet headPut your hand insidePut your hand insidePut your hand inside the puppet headMemo to myself: do the dumb things I gotta doTouch the puppet headQuit my job down at the carwashDidn't have to write no-one a good-bye noteThat said, "The check's in the mail, andI'll see you in church, and don't you ever change"If the pu-pu-puppet headWas only bu-bu-busted inI'll see you after schoolPut your hand inside the puppet headPut your hand inside the puppet headPut your hand insidePut your hand insidePut your hand inside the puppet headPut your hand inside the puppet headPut your hand inside the puppet headPut your hand insidePut your hand insidePut your hand inside the puppet head
