Well you can do it in your sleepAnd then you worry for a weekBut with the magic up your sleeveEverybody's falling at your feetEverybody's falling at your feetBut the liar gets the partCause the honest go too farSo when they laugh don't take it to heartYou made a plastiscenic work of artA plastiscenic work of artSave me, save me from the lies I got in my mindCause it's hard enough to see you're good on the insideAnd the leaving when it works, the hardest to timeWhen your dealing in the dirt and healing the blindYou're looking down the telescopeFrom the only end you knowWhere life is big and we're still closeEverybody gets a second goEverybody gets another goSave me, save me from the lies I got in my mindCause it's hard enough to see you're good on the insideAnd the leaving when it works, the hardest to timeWhen your dealing in the dirt and healing the blind (x2)Sa...ve me(chorus x2)
