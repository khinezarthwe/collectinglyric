I've seen it in my hands, burn in my heartSeen it in my past, back in my homeBut does it make sense to see her again?I don't, knowI felt it for some time, and not at allPoison in my head, god love hurtsI'm not looking for love, but it's hard to resistI don't recall being this deadShe's the only one, lost the best I hadI found her in a dream, looking for meThis heart's on fire, I'll bring myselfUp to fall, and down againThese arms of mineDon't mind who they holdSo should I maybe, Just leave love aloneYou call out my name, for the love you needBut you wont find it in meThese arms are mineDon't mind who they holdYou're made for me, and I'll leave love aloneYou call out my name for the love you needBut you wont find it in meI've seen it in my hands, burn in my heartI found her in a dream looking for meBut does it make sense to see her again?I don't, knowI can see the end of what I begunA tale of a love, come and goneBut now my love, no promisesI won't go, falling in love
