On my heart, I'll bear the shameNo prayer can ease the painNo one will love youNo one will love you the way I doNo one will love you, love you like I doAnd there's no escapeJust countless mistakesNo one will love youNo one will love you the way I doNo one will love you, love you like I doIt will never be the sameWitness trust fade awayNo one will love youNo one will love you the way I doNo one will love you , love you like I doNo one will love youNo one will love the way I doNo one will love you , love you like I doLove you like I do
