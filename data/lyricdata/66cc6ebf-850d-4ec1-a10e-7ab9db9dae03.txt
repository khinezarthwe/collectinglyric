No map looking for the one I loveCause the one I love is hereNo map looking for the one who standsCause he's arming me from fearWe got tuned in by the other sideLives spent digging holes for the ones that hideSee the white of my eyesI'm a stuntmanSee the white of my eyesI'm a stuntmanSee the white of my eyesI'm a stuntmanSee the white of my eyesMore cuts taken for the one in silenceNow he sits between my earsHis moves in madness how I love the rushCould you wipe away these tearsWe got taken byA rush of bloodMy train's leaving nowHow I wish I couldSee the white of my eyesI'm a stuntmanSee the white of my eyesI'm a stuntmanSee the white of my eyesI'm a stuntmanSee the white of my eyesSee the white of my eyesI'm a stuntmanSee the white of my eyesI'm a stuntmanSee the white of my eyesI'm a stuntmanSee the white of my eyesSee the white of my eyesI'm a stuntmanSee the white of my eyesI'm a stuntmanSee the white of my eyesI'm a stuntmanSee the white of my eyes
