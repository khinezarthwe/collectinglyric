When I came down the dawn poured into meI shook 'em up, the walls came crumblingMy thin skin trembling with these salty woundsMy stolen gold inside the emperors tombNow painting rainbows on my ugly faceI built this cardboard neighborhoods disgraceBut I ascend and serve my feverish needWithin the confines of such chemistryIts the way I seeEverything I needIts no way to beLet this be our little secretNo one needs to know we're feelingHigher and higher and higherHigher and higher and higherBut I feel alive and I feel it in meUp and up we keep on climbingHigher and higher and higherHigher and higher and higherMy face blew up at such a casual sightThe spattered colors of ecstatic frightThe rush above me to oblivionOutlining wet sidewalks in halogenOh have you ever felt so goddamned strongHow come it takes some people so damn longHe turned to squeeze the lemon juice to rainThe citrus drawing out the scene in stainsWatch the basin drainAs your lifelines wanesAnd you cant explainAs your friends complainYou've caused all this painAnd you proudly shameYour poor family's nameLet this be our little secretNo one needs to know we're feelingHigher and higher and higherHigher and higher and higherBut I feel alive and I feel it in meUp and up we keep on climbingHigher and higher and higherHigher and higher and higherMother I can tell what you've been thinkingStaring at the stars on your ceilingThinking once there was a power that you were wieldingAnd now I've hit the markStaring at the darkAnd I cannot help but ignore the people staring at my scarsLet this be our little secretNo one needs to know we're feelingHigher and higher and higherHigher and higher and higherBut I feel alive and I feel it in meUp and up we keep on climbingHigher and higher and higherHigher and higher and higher
