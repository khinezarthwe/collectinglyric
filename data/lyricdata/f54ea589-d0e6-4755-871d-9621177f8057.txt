Maybe it's intuitionBut some things you just don't questionLike in your eyesI see my future in an instantAnd there it goesI think I've found my best friendI know that it might sound more than a little crazyBut I believeI knew I loved you before I met youI think I dreamed you into lifeI knew I loved you before I met youI have been waiting all my lifeThere's just no rhyme or reasonOnly this sense of completionAnd in your eyesI see the missing piecesI'm searching forI think I've found my way homeI know that it might sound more than a little crazyBut I believeI knew I loved you before I met youI think I dreamed you into lifeI knew I loved you before I met youI have been waiting all my lifeA thousand angels dance around youI am complete now that I've found youI knew I loved you before I met youI think I dreamed you into lifeI knew I loved you before I met youI have been waiting all my lifeI knew I loved you before I met youI think I dreamed you into lifeI knew I loved you before I met youI have been waiting all my lifeOohOohOh
