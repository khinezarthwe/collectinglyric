Failure is angular, it isn't circle shapedAnd every fucked mistake's unmadeWhen I abandoned her and with my wand-like sex I cast a horrid hexI laid a curse on her, another wasted verse on her, gave birth to herOh God, forgive me Moses, Jesus, AllahI have made such an awful regret of todayI have made such an awesome regretI could be more than thisWith all the time I have I am an insult to the deadYou should be over this, the infidelities are on account of meAnd so I cheat on you, I beat on you with words and with actionsI will never tell the truth, in debt, aloofWithout you I'm a fractionOh God I have made such an awful regret of todayI have made such an awesome regretToo bad this won't come easy where I stayWhere I lay in my bed of needles, where I playLike I'm a bad child on a baby's birthdayI'll take a permanent vacation, I've got two months to liveAnd all the mental masturbation is just too much to giveSo I'll go down to where the river flows into the seaAnd you can bathe me in your body fluids, You can rescue me
