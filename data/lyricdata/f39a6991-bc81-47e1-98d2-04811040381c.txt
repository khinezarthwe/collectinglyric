Make the sadness go awayCome back another dayFor years, I've tried to teachBut their eyes are emptyEmpty too I have becomeFor them, I must dieA sad and troubled raceAn ungrateful troubled placeI see the sadness in their eyesMelancholy in their criesDevoid of all the passionThe human spirit cannot dieLook at the pain around meThis is what I cry forLook at the pain around meThis is what I'll die forMake the sadness go awayCome back another dayThe things I've said and doneDon't matter to anyoneBut still, you push me to seeSomething I can never beWhy am I their shattered king?I don't mean anythingI see the sadness in their eyesMelancholy in their criesDevoid of all the passionThe human spirit cannot dieLook at the pain around meThis is what I cry forLook at the pain around meThis is what I'll die for
