The party's over nowSo draw the curtains downYour secret's safe to keepUnzip your velvet gownAnd let your hair hang looseKick off your satin shoesThrow back the ida downFarewell to Friday's clownThe circus is leaving townOh Ruby, roll your stockins downCircus is leaving townOh Ruby, dry your eyesFix up something to heapStill water still run deepThe dogs are barking nowGet back out on the streetThe circus is leaving townOh Ruby, roll your stockins downCircus is leaving townSo Ruby, dry your eyesThe party is over nowStop howling at the moonYou need a different beatYou need a different tuneRemember that old songWe heard when we were youngLife was an empty pageThe world would ride uponDo you recall the meadow pastWe sit and watch the hours passYou were such a good girl thenOh ruby dry your eyesCircus is leaving townOh Ruby, roll your stockins downCircus is leaving townSo Ruby, dry your eyesYou're searching when you walkYou're searching when you talkYou could make me believeThat the sun sets in the eastThe sun sets in the eastThe sun sets in the east
