Time, all the long red lines, that take controlOf all the smoke-like streams that flow into your dreamsThat big blue open sea that can't be crossedThat can't be climbed, just born betweenOh, the two white lines, distant Gods and faded signsOf all those blinking lights, you had to pick the one tonightHoles, dug by little moles, angry jealous spiesGot telephones for eyes, come to you as friendsAll those endless ends, that can't be tiedOh, they make me laugh, and always make me cryTill they drop like flies, and sink like polished stonesOf all the stones I throw, how does that old song go?How does that old song go?Bands, those funny little plans, that never work quite right
