(Gerard Love)If I could find the words to sayThe sun shines in your eyesSo brighten up my city skyBreak out the news, it's back againThe voice that tried to singShe don't hang onAnd hope's never going to teach meWake up the story's overClimb aboard I'm going nowhereAnd understand if I must sayI'd give both these wings awayI'd steal a car to drive you homeI don't look back on an empty feelingRepaint the Blues, my saving graceIs lost without a traceThe morning sun's a fire in spaceShe lives in your life everydayStretching time to stayGot my mind set something else so it's hard to seeI don't need a guiding light to lead me in the darkAnd understand if I must sayI'd give both these wings awayI'd steal a car to drive you homeI don't look back on an empty feeling(Don't look back) on an empty feeling(Don't look back) on an empty feeling(Don't look back) on an empty feeling(Don't look back) on an empty feeling{SOLO}
