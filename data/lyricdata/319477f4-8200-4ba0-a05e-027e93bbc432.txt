I'm the demon, you can trust meI'm the demon, as you can seeI'm the demon, for you are freeYou'll be safe if you listen to meJust a taste is all you needYou'll feel better with help from meHungry for your brain to easeIf you don't take it you go crazyYou're a man can do what you wantNoone tells you to do or don'tThe demon is here when you're feeling weakTake some of this, listen when i speakTake this stuff, it'll fix your lifeYou'll love it more than your wifeYou give up, and you'll be ruledYou'll be one of the devil's foolsJust try a little, you can help yourselfTo feel no pain equals all the wealthTake some more cause it's almost timeOne more shot and your soul is mineSee the world through black glassesWatch my life as it passesThrough the city to the gates of hallThe demons there all will know me wellIn the pain of my nightmareJust give me more cause I don't careTake me deeper, take me downDemons wait for you undergroundWalk with demons beneath your feetYou have things you must take, and dealers to meetYou cant control the spin, not by the shape that you're inHow could you tell you would wake up in hell
