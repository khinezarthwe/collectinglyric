Forgive me, please, but do repeat what you said while its fresh in your head, the way those consonants stretched, before you forgetWait there, that's it just at the split of your lips, before your tongue gives to lisp, wearing that sweet sinful slip, spins a crippling ellipseA swell of strings sing 'neath the pleats of my dress and speeds what beats 'neath my breast until the song they suggest taps traces of wetWhat wake that shape did make conducting the way they phrase this endless refrain and for the next several days I'm braced 'neath the waistCreased of these sheets and half asleep it seems to speak through meThe sweet symphony might simply be the sound of space between conceived of where we meetMight pure proximity then cease to restrict that which exists of such bliss, where that it rings of all things with strict consonanceBless we with breath lest we forget what you said to loose this noise in my head for that in flesh unto death might we seamlessly blendAnd should I pass away I pray a tape be lain upon my grave and these sweet remains may play that melody to say whats left between these knees at ease
