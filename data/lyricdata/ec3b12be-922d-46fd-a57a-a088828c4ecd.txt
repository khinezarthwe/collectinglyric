A mastermind in the old watchtowerPrying eyes must never find.Playing God in the final hourInsanity, such a fine lineOverwhelmed by the mourning processAnd the loss of his dearly lovedThe Doctor's work is now obsessionWhat is life? What's beyond?He wants to know what it's like to be GodCreating life with his own handsTo reanimate lifeless tissuesThe Devil's work, the doctor's planA man of wealth and a genius mindA slave to passion and his morbid sideRobbing graves of the newly deadErratic tendencies, a troubled mindI will create in my own imageIf God can then why can't I?No thought of the consequencesI've got to know the meaning of lifeLightning strikes, it's the witching hourThe monstrosity comes aliveA victim of man's vanityBorn in delirium, a deranged childHe turns his back on his own creationChaos ensues, the innocent dieWho's the monster?Who's the victim?Crucify!!! Crucify!!!
