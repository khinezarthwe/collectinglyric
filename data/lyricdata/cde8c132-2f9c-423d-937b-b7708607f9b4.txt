I gazed a forgivelessness starThinkin' about my lifeI've been so old and youg nowadaysFell in love twiceI found love three timesI found another worldThe boys downtown are selling birdsSelling you and IThey said you've gone awayI didn't believe'em thenMy eyes became a strange old ledA red bleach in my sightAnd I dreamed about the world I was gonna findI opened my eyes, I checked out the timeI heard my name, there was no one to blameI thought about the next shoesAnd it wrecked my mindI thought about the dayI was not gonna find..Then you came back againI felt so happy thenLook, our cats and dogsAre lying together on the grass fieldThey smoke the same cigarDreaming about the one they loveSo dream, babe, babe about the one you loveThis way you're gonna fill the worldWith loveThis way you're gonna face all your daysWith certainliesBabe, babe, babe dream about your love
