I will dig a holeSave my pennies for a rainy dayI will dig a holeSavin' pennies for a rainy dayI'm not scaredI will build a wallSensin' trouble from a mile awayI will build a wallSaw it comin' from a mile awayI'm not scared, I'm not scaredTry when your inside's outI don't even tryI know I have seen the best I'll haveI don't even tryI will just play dumbI won't hear a single word that's saidAnd I will bite my tongueNever sing another song againI'm not scared, I'm not scaredTry when my inside's outI don't even tryI know I have seen the best I'll haveI don't even tryNever been one to take my chancesI don't even tryClouds are comin', air gets heavyLooks like trouble on a rainy daySun starts sinkin', can't see my shadowLooks like trouble on a rainy dayHoles uncovered, walls will crumbleAll spells trouble on a rainy day
