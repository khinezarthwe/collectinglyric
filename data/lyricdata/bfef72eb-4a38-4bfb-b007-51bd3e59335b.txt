There's always some bird-dogSnuffling, chokingLooking like you came to collectSomething you said you owedThere's always some turtle snapping in my headSaying you can't just waltz in hereActing like nothing is wrongNo dancing, no dancing, no dancingNot while the road is racingNo dancing, no dancing, no dancingNot while the time is chasingThere's a poacher on the landI recognize his handIn the mailHe's fogging up the glassThe bird is on the lastAnd here he comesHere he comes, ohNo dancing, no dancing, no dancingNot while the wires are showingNo dancing, no dancing, no dancingNot while the time is flowingThere's a poacher on the landI recognize his handIn the mailHe's fogging up the glassThe bird is on the lastAnd here he comesHere he comes, ohNo dancing, no dancing, no dancingNot while the time is flowingNo dancing, no dancing, no dancingNot while your wires are showing
