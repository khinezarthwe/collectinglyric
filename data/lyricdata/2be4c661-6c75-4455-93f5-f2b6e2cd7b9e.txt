Talkin' to a punker priest,Just doggin' the breeze bout bein' in a tree.(He says they're free now.)Along comes Mary-Christ, skatin' light on ice,Says "Let's go on high."(Later, priestoid.)Gotta go, I got a date now.Yeah, I know, shall not be late now.Possessed by X-ray eyes, her spirit spies into my lie.(Let's burn 'em out now.)Wraps my head in skin, says now I'm in, dig the candy sin.(Yeh, spit it out now.)Every time she sings that low song,Every time I know she's right/wrong.Angel in a devil skirt buys me a shirt,Says "I hope you like."(Like what now?)Hope, I hope you like,Like you like your hope,Walk the tightest rope.(I see, I know now.)Here we go, been waiting so long.Yeah, I know, for Mary to come along.Talkin' to a punker priest,Just doggin' the breeze bout bein' in a tree.(He says they're free now.)Along comes Mary-Christ, skatin' light on ice,Says "Let's go on high."(Later, priestoid.)Gotta go, I got a date now.Yeah, I know, shall not be late now.Possessed by X-ray eyes, her spirit spies into my lie.(Let's burn 'em out now.)Angel in a devil skirt buys me a shirt,Says "I hope you like."(Yeh, spit it out now.)Here we go, been waitin' so long.Yeah, I know, for Mary to come along.
