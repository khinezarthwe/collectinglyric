I'm sick of being aloneWhen are you coming home?Just a glimpse of your faceI can remember smelling your hairI'll meet you anywhereSomewhere that no one can retraceSomewhere where nobody will know our facesShe has two arms to hold meAnd four legs to wrap around meShe's not your typical girlfriendShe's my alienShe knows when something is wrongWhen something doesn't belongShe can read in my mindAnd she can be assured that with meThere is no conspiracyshe's not wasting her timeShe can take me to the place that she calls homeIn a spaceship that will someday be my ownPlease take me to your leaderTell her I will surrender (I will surrender)She has two arms to hold meAnd four legs to wrap around meShe's not your typical girlfriendShes my alien(My alien...)She has two arms to hold meAnd four legs to wrap around meShe's not your typical girlfriendShe has two arms to hold meAnd four legs to wrap around meShe's not your typical girlfriend(My alien)I bought the astronaut kitNow all I need is a rocketMy love intergalactic friendMy alien
