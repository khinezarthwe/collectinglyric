I've been hanging around you for sometimeI've been dancing around you for sometimeCan you feel my weightWhile we sip the day awayCan you feel my weightWhile we drink the day awayLet's get drunk on ourselvesLet's get drunk on ourselvesOoh and then it happenedOoh and then it happenedOoh you split me open so tenderlyOoh oh split me so perfectlyThis isn't love between usJust a moment we shareDon't pretend that you careBut I like the way you move meFor some time nowI like it in this placeNoI love it in this placeOoh and then it happenedOoh and then it happenedYou said you would kill meHands wrapped around my neckI feel so aliveOoh and then it happenedOoh and then it happenedYou said you would kill meHands wrapped around my neckI feel so alive
