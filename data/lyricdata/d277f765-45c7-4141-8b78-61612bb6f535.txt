Please, please forgive meBut I won't be home againMaybe someday you'll look upAnd barely conscious you'll say to no one"Isn't something missing?"You won't cry for my absence I knowYou forgot me long agoAm I that unimportant?Am I so insignificant?Isn't something missing?Isn't someone missing me?Even though I'm the sacrifice,You won't try for me, not now.Though I'd die to know you love me,I'm all alone.Isn't someone missing me?Please, please forgive meBut I won't be home again.I know what you do to yourself,I breathe deep and cry out,"Isn't something missing?Isn't someone missing me?"Even though I'm the sacrifice,You won't try for me, not now.Though I'd die to know you love me,I'm all alone.Isn't someone missing me?And if I bleed,I'll bleed:Knowing you don't care.And if I sleep,Just to dream of you,And wake without you there.Isn't something missing?Isn't something...?Even though I'm the sacrifice,You won't try for me, not now.Though I'd die to know you love me,I'm all alone.Isn't something missing?Isn't someone missing me?
