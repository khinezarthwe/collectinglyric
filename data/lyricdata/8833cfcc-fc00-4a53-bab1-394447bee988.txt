Lies are smeared across my faceThey say it's common placeBut you see through meAnd I see through youI'm shot full of holesAnd so are youRun away, or stayIt's all the sameYou made your bedAnd in the end that's where you'll layBut we can laugh to sleepDirt runs through this placeIt's all across your faceAnd yea, my eyes are blackYea, they caught me lookingOh, all of these namesAre as permanent as gravesAnd if you catch me breathing heavySink me before I bend my kneeI lost myselfAnd you sat and sharpened your nailsOn my bedroom floorI tried to run but they caught meAnd I broke away, but they caught me againAll the roads are dead endsBut even if your blood has to dieIt's enough, it's enoughSomeone's gotta pay itAll of these bonesThey all get stacked so highCut it off, time is outJust come and take your place
