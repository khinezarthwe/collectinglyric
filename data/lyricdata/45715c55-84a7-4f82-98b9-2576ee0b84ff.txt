Come on!And I can see her nowDancing around, her drink in handAll her baggage you towI just want to forget and let go of all the joyAll of the painI took your guilt and placed it into meAnd now I kiss it goodbyeOur last dance ended fatallyWho's sleeping on my side of the bed tonight?Have you ever cried so hard?Baby you just died(You just died)Who's sleeping on my side of the bed tonight?Have you ever cried so hard?Have you ever cried so hard?And there she goes againAnother masquerade in false circumstanceShe'll fuck you just for the tasteI just wish that I could replaceAll the memories of what makes my blood run coldAnd as your blood runs through meI say goodbye to what we hadWho's sleeping on my side of the bed tonight?Have you ever cried so hard?Baby you just died(You just died)Who's sleeping on my side of the bed tonight?Have you ever cried so hard?Have you ever cried so hard?She came and wentI gnawed through my lip, makeup smeared in her eyesEach sob's a reason to say goodbyeSometimes when you're holding onYou'll never see the lightWith flowers in her hairGazed upon with dead lover's eyesShe never looked so goodAnd I never felt so rightWith flowers in her hairGazed upon with dead lover's eyesShe never looked so goodAnd I never felt so rightI never felt so rightI never felt so WRONG![Whispered]With flowers in her hairGazed upon with dead lover's eyesShe never looked so goodAnd I never felt so rightWho's sleeping on my side of the bed tonight?Have you ever cried so hard?Baby, you just diedWho's sleeping on my side of the bed tonight?Have you ever cried so hard?Have you ever cried so hard?YOU JUST DIED!
