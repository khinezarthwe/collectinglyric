This would not have happened if I hadn't missed my planeI would've been there when they told you I'm the rat within the grainWithin this big misunderstanding now, I'm being misunderstoodI'm thinkin' someone's trying to fuck with me and set fire to my woodI wouldn't want you to want to be wanted by meI wouldn't want you to worry you'd be drowned within my seaI only wanted to be wonderful, and wonderful is trueIn truth, I only really wanted to be wanted by youIt's a stupid situation now where everything goes wrongIf you can't tell if I am lying, then you do not belongIn my bed, go rest your head upon the bones of a bigger manAnd he can cover you with rockwool and you can close up like a clam'Cause I wouldn't want you to want to be wanted by meI wouldn't want you to worry you'd be drowned within my seaI only wanted to be wonderful, and wonderful is trueIn truth, I only really wanted to be wanted by youSo go play with your piano and write a mediocre songAbout this shell of mediocrityAnd pretend there's nothing wrongI never thought you were a chicken shitI never thought of you at allUntil you asked me to be part of itAnd now you're showing me a wallI wouldn't want you to want to be wanted by meI wouldn't want you to worry you'd be drowned within my seaI only wanted to be wonderful and wonderful is trueIn truth, I only really wanted to be wanted by youLa la la...In truth, I only really wanted to be wanted by you
