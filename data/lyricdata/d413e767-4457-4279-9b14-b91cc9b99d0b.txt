Hanging onHere until I'm goneRight where I belongJust hanging onEven thoughWatched you come and goHow was I to knowYou'd steal the show?One day I'll have enough to gambleI'll wait to hear your final callBet it allHanging onHere until I'm goneRight where I belongJust hanging onEven thoughPass this time aloneSomewhere so unknownIt heals the soulYou ask for wallsI'll build them higherWe'll lie in shadows of them allI'd stand but they're much too tallAnd I fallFebruary starsFloating in the darkTemporary scarsFebruary starsFebruary starsFloating in the darkTemporary scarsFebruary starsFebruary starsFloating in the darkTemporary scarsFebruary stars
