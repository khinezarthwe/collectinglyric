You used to take your watch off before we made loveYou didn't want to share our time with anyoneYou used to close your eyes when we kissed goodbyeYou didn't want to see me draped in sadnessAnd now there's nothing here, now there's nothing here at allIn a loft conversion off new north roadAnd now there's nothing here, now there's nothing here at allYou were here, I was here, there was something real hereI know there wasYou know I still adore youBut in a different kind of wayYou know I still adore youBut things have gotten vagueBaby, I don't ask for muchBut things have gotten convenient, ohYou know I still adore youBut things have kind of changedAnd to think I laughed at you for how you saw the worldWith all that empty space inside your heartI have to cling to things now, doubles and cigarettesForever trying to find you on the lips of someone elseYou know I still adore youBut in a different kind of wayYou know I still adore youBut things have gotten vagueBaby, I don't ask for muchBut things have gotten convenient, ohYou know I still adore youBut things have kind of changedJust take me backTo the startWhen your earthquakeWas just cracksYou must ask yourselfEverydayJust how highAre the highs
