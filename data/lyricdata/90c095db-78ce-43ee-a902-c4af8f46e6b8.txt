Feel the hate from myMisery surround youAs you watch me fallAs you watch me dieSlowly I decayFrom the world around meSlowly I declineAs you hear me lie thatI live Lie thatI live Feel the cold from myIcy hands around youAs you slowly fallAs you slowly dieNever to return to the worldYou know of Fear you will know wellAs you hear me lie thatI live Lie that I liveYou have not known painTill you've lived asI do You will never knowTill you hear me lie thatI live Lie that I liveLie that I live Lie that I live
