I was waiting for you,holding all the globes in my hand.With a stack of papersheld together by a rubber band.This lecture's boring,too much talking about one man.Not a single momenttucked inside your lesson plan.I regret to inform you,we won't need ya here no more.This building's crowdedand here my friend is the exit door.With the map turned sideways,you can get lost any way you go.These are directions.They must be clear if you want to know.I was waiting for you,holding all the globes in my hand.With a stack of papersheld together by a rubber band.
