When darkness foldsAcross this old skyYes, I'll open upFor you that nightBut still shadows they comeAm I safe in your armsCan I be your sourceOf love tonight?I'll wait for the dayWhen you creep through the window and hold meSmash into my life and now hold meDon't set me freeI've waited so long, yes I'm dyingSmash into me someone and hold meSpeed into this shell and now hold meHold meHold meCan you tell meWill I ever dream againIn your armsI now know that I'm home againI'm home againI'm home againI'm home againI'm drunk for your loveSpeed into my lifeSpeak to me nowJust speak to me someoneFor I know your tasteAnd I can supply
