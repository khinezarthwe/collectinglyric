Go on, make me feel it's useless.When in fact it's you that needs to have me near.So now keep me at safe distanceand with a little persistance I'll make it crystal clear.Chorus:I'll be around only if you want me to be there by your side.I'm ready for you.So don't be afraid 'cause I know what you're going through.So when you think it's timeI'm ready for you.Now you seem to be content with a one sided friendshipwith you I've got to chase.Slow down so I can smell the rosesbut the road you chose is crooked and unpaved.my tires are spinning but to no avail.ChorusBridgeChorus x2
