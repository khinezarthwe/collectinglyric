Imagine in your mind, a posh country clubThe stuffy old money, where the poor get snubbedThe spread is bland, sauerkraut and boiled gooseThere's no way these people will ever cut looseBut then I walk in the room, hold my boombox highAnd what happened next, will blow your mindEverything got out of controlThe music was so entrancingEveryone got out on the floorIt was a bunch of old white people dancingNow picture, if you will, a bunch of businessmenStuffed in the boardroom like pigs in a penThe ties around their necks are like a hangman's nooseIn the middle of the table, there's a boiled gooseThe old people smell makes you want to puke in the sinkThese dudes will never danceYeah, that's what you thinkI stride in the room, all young and hipHold up my boombox, and say "Listen to this"Then, everyone started to movePeople rejoiced, instead of financingYour preconceived notions were shatteredBy the super old white people dancingThe Big Apple, where people never danceSpirits go down, while profits expandThe cops or the dealers; who's got the juice?The street vendors peddling their boiled gooseSo many types of people, they'll never get along'Til I bust out my boombox and play this songThe music washed away all the hateAnd society started advancingEvery demographic was representedIt was a Rainbow Coalition of DancingWhoa, everyone was wearing fingerless glovesWhoa, I saw a Spanish guy doing the BartmanTransport now to an old folks homeWhere the elderly are tossed on their brittle bonesThe orderlies are stealing, there's no excuse!Everyday for lunch they eat boiled goose!So I grab my boombox, and hit the turbo bassAnd what happened next, was a total disgraceEverybody started having sexThe music was way too powerfulA bunch of old people fucking like rabbitsIt was disgusting to say the leastA boombox could change the worldYou gotta know your limits with a boomboxAnd this was a cautionary taleA boombox is not a toy!
