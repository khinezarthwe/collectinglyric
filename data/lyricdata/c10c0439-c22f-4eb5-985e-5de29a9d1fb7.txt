I think I'll take a moment to celebrate my ageThe ending of an era, and the turning of a pageNow it's time to focus in on where I go from hereLord, have mercy on my next thirty yearsIn my next thirty yearsI'm gonna have some funTrying to forget about all the crazy things I've doneMaybe now I've conquered all my adolescent fearsAnd I'll do it better in my next thirty yearsIn my next thirty yearsI'm gonna settle all the scoresCry a little less, laugh a little moreFind a world of happiness without the hate and fearFigure out just what I'm doing here, in my next thirty yearsOh my next thirty yearsI'm gonna watch my weightEat a few more salads and not stay up so lateDrink a little lemonade and not so many beers, huhMaybe I'll remember my next thirty yearsMy next thirty yearsWill be the best years of my lifeRaise a little family and hang out with my wifeSpend precious moments with the ones that I hold dearMake up for lost time hereIn my next thirty yearsIn my next thirty yearsoh yhaohhhhhHere we go boys
