Chariots clashed in the dead of nightSubversiveness clouds the clearest of mindsBlink of an eye we're collateralizedRaised up in arms never knowing whyWe give what we take when we take nothingPull the helmet from your eyesWe're erased and betrayed by mistakesDoes your god know my god?This is how the world will endAnd it begs the questionWhen bullets cloud the skyTaking away the pain ofThinking for ourselvesDemons beat downThey break down our doorsAnd it begs the question"Could this scene be real?"Stealing away our childrenTaking away our dreamsWe give what we take when we take nothingPull the helmet from your eyesWe're erased and betrayed by mistakesDoes your god know my god?This is how the world will end (world will end)Does your god know my god?This is how the world will endWe give what we take when we take nothingPull the helmet from your eyesWe're erased and betrayed by mistakesOhDoes your god know my god?This is how the world will end (world will end)Does your god know my god?This is how the world will end (world will end)Does your god know my god?This is how the world will end (world will end)Does your god know my god? (this is how the world will end)This is how the world will end
