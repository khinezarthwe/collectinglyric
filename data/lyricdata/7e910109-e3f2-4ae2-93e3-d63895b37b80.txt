In the day, in the nightSay it right, say it allYou either got it or you don'tYou either stand or you fallWhen your will is brokenWhen it slips from your handWhen there's no time for jokingThere's a hole in the planOh, you don't mean nothing at all to meNo, you don't mean nothing at all to meBut you got what it takes to set me freeOh, you could mean everything to meI can't saythat I'm notAt a lossand at faultI can't saythat I don'tLove the lightand the darkI can't say that I don'tKnow that I am aliveAnd I love what I feelI could showyou tonight, you tonightOh, you don't mean nothing at all to meNo, you don't mean nothing at all to meBut you got what it takes to set me freeOh, you could mean everything to meFrom my hands, I could give youSomething that I madeFrom my mouth, I could sing youAnother brick that I laidFrom my bodyI could show youA placeGod knowsYou should know, this space is holyDo you really wanna go?
