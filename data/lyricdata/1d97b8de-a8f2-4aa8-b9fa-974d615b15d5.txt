As a young boy chasing dragons, with your wooden sword so mighty.You're St. George or you're David and you always killed the beast.Times change very quickly,And you had to grow up early,A house in smoking ruins and the bodies at your feet.You'll die as you livedIn a flash of the blade,In a corner forgotten by no one.You lived for the touchFor the feel of the steel,One man, and his honour.The smell of resined leatherThe steely iron maskAs you cut and thrust and parried at the fencing master's call.He taught you all he ever knewTo fear no mortal manAnd now you'll wreak your vengeance in the screams of evil men.You'll die as you livedIn a flash of the blade,In a corner forgotten by no one.You lived for the touchFor the feel of the steel,One man, and his honour.You'll die as you livedIn a flash of the blade,In a corner forgotten by no one.You lived for the touchFor the feel of the steel,One man, and his honour.
