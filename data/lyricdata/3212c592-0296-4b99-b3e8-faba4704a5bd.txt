Golden lights displaying your nameGolden lights - it's a terrible shameBut oh, my darlingWhy did you change?Boy in a million, idol, a big starI didn't tell you how great you wereI didn't grovel and screamAnd rip your brand new jacket at the seamsYou made a record and they liked your singingAll of a sudden the phone stops ringingI never thought you would letThe glory make you forgetGolden lights displaying your nameGolden lights - it's a terrible shameBut oh, my darlingWhy did you change?Top ten idol, king of your ageWho do you turn to when you're backstage?Don't you remember you once knew a girlYou loved her more than the worldIs life always like this, brotherGood for one side and bad for anotherI must put you behind me tonight'Cause you belong to the lightsThose golden lights displaying your nameGolden lights - it's a terrible shameBut oh, my darlingWhy did you change?Oh, oh my darlingWhy, why did you change?
