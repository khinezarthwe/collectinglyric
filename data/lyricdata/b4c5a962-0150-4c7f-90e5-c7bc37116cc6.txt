Won't someone give me a gun?Oh, well it's for my brotherWell he writes the lineWrote right down my spineIt says 'Oh, do you believe in love there?'So, slow downSlow downYou're taking me overAnd so we drownSir, we drownStop taking me overWon't someone give me some fun?As the skin flies all around usWe kiss in his room to a popular tuneOh, real drownersSo, slow downSlow downYou're taking me overAnd so we drownSir, we drownStop taking me over
