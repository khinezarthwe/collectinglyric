GoSince you left I've found myself locked in another prisonBut your bars and chains can't take the heart out of this manWithout you my skies are always gray.Now I'm seeing red through a different face.What can I say that hasn't been said before?I wrote your name in blood on my prison wallsAnd without your contact those memories are all I haveSo I can't feel alone, I'll never be aloneThe chemicals aren't alignedNow I'm struggling to find your fucking spineI'll rip out your spineYou can take my painBut you can't have my heartYou can lock me in this cold dark cellBut you can't have my heartOhWhat can I say that hasn't been said before?I wrote your name in blood on my prison wallsAnd without your contact those memories are all I haveSo I can't feel alone, I'll never be aloneWithout you my skies are always gray.Now I'm seeing red through a different face.(2x)
