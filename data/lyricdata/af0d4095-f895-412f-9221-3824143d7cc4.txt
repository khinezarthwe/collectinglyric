Rise up with fervid zeal,Salvation's at hand,Forged in flames as stars collide.Recite the sacred rites,Evoke the astral beast,Black magic, astrology.In sacred flames it congregates,The ancient rage and priest,Fusing the fetus and beast.The Setian redeemer,Man's blood must infect,The weapon, the grand architect.(Chorus)Behold the wicked, the child is born,Coalesced of the celestial beast,Divine equation, the prophecy,Rejoice in the birth born is he.Disciples and minionsSpread word, born is he,Thrust hell upon humanity.Baptize the wicked child,The math upon his crown,On this day we concecrate.(Chorus)Behold the wicked, the child is born,Coalesced of the celestial beast,Divine equation, the prophecy,Rejoice in the birth born is he.(Chorus)Behold the wicked, the child is born,Coalesced of the celestial beast,Divine equation, the prophecy,Rejoice in the birth born is he.Embrace the power of this sixth hour,On the sixth day of the sixth month,Behold the child, our path to light,We'll guide him with undying love.
