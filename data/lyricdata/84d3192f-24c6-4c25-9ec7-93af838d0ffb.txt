There's a light bulb in your headand if you break it you'll be dead.My friend's had something that they saidthat I can't remember.It took a haircut to trim my ears,and make it focused, clean and clear.You've gotta make way for the genius to appear.You've gotta make way for the genius to appear.Look out!They're making records in a day!You can't believe them, don't trust the words they say,'cause they're telling lies now to everybody in town.Well, watch out!I burnt the roof right off of my mouth!We're building, we're building an electric house, you can come see it.It's over the fence in the front yard.
