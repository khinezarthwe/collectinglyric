Back through the years I go wondering once againBack to the seasons of my youthI recall a box of rags that someone gave usAnd how my mamma put these rags to useThere were rags of many colours, and every piece was smallAnd I didn't have a coat and it was way down in the fallMamma sewed the rags together, sewing ever piece with loveShe made my coat of many colours, that I was so proud ofAs she sewed she told the story from the bible she had readAbout a coat of many colours, Joseph wore and they she saidPerhaps this coat will bring you, much love and happinessAnd I just couldn't wait to wear it, and mamma blessed it with a kissMy coat of many colours that mamma made for meMade only rags, but I wore it so proudlyAlthough we had no money. oh I was rich as I could beIn my coat of many colours, my mamma made for meSo with patches on my breaches and holes in both my shoesIn my coat of many colours, I hurried off to schoolJust to find the others laughing and makin' fun of meIn my coat of many colours, my mamma made for meOh, I couldn't understand it, for I felt I was richAnd I told them of the love my mamma sewed in ever stitchAnd I told them all the story, mamma told me while she sewedAnd how my coat of many colours is worth more than all of their clothesThey didn't under stand it and I tried to make them seeThat one is only poor only if they choose to beNow I know we have no money, but I'm as rich as I could beIn my coat of many colours, my mamma made for meIn my coat of many colours, my mamma just made for me
