This nightWalk the deadIn a solitary style and crash the cemetery gatesIn the dress your husband hatesWay downMark the graveWhere the searchlights find us drinking by the mausoleum doorAnd they found you on the bathroom floorI miss youI miss you so farAnd the collision of your kiss that made it so hardBack homeOff the runSinging songs that make you slit your wristsIt isn't that much funStaring down a loaded gunSo I won't stop dyingWon't stop lyingIf you want I'll keep on cryingDid you get what you deserve?Is this what you always want me for?I miss youI miss you so farAnd the collision of your kiss that made it so hardWay downWay downWay downWay downWay downWay downWay downWay downI miss youI miss you so farAnd the collision of your kiss that made it so hardAnd well I miss youAnd well I miss you so farAnd the collision of your kiss that made it so hardThat made it so hardWay downWay downWay downWay downWay downWay downWay downWay downWay down
