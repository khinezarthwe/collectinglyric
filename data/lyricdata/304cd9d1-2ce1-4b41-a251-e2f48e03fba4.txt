"It ain't my faultIt's 6' o' clock in the morning"He saidAs he came up out of the nightWhen he found I had no coins to bumHe began to testifyBorn in a depressionBorn out of good luckBorn into miseryIn the back of a truck...I'm telling you this misterDon't be put off by looksI been in the ring and I took those right hooksOh the lonelinessUsed to knock me out â€“ harder than the restAnd I've worked for breakfast'N' I ain't had no lunchI been on delivery and received every punchSuddenly I noticed that it weren't quite the sameFeel different one morningMaybe it was the rainBut everywhere I looked all over the cityThey're runnin' in an out of the barsSomeone stopped for a pick-up driving one of those carsY'see I always wanted one of those carsLong black 'n' shiny an' pull up to the barsHonk your horn, put down your windows, push yer buttonHear it coming inYou can say I can see the light ... roll!Forward! Drive! Green lights! Green lights!Intersection city comingA running comeback homeI run back not that strong nowYes who's there now, can I help you?Calling Intel station lightDid you put it inIt say go, I say go, she say goSo we say goCos' I can see the light all night tonightThis night right nowComing on forward motion across the oceanAn' up the hills yeh boys let's strike for the hillsWhile that petrol tank is fullGimme a push gimme a pullGimme a llama gimme a muleGimme a donkey or gimme a horseDown the avenueSo fineIn style
