And the first one tore a pictureOf a dead and hanging manWho was kissing foreign fishesThat flew right out from his handsAnd when I put my arms around himFelt the blushing blood run through my cheeksAnd an eerieness surroundedWhen his tongue began to speakAnd he said, "Oh, boy, you are so pretty,Enough to wrap tight in rice-paper string"And when I finally kissed himThe whole world began to ringLost like a bell that's tipping overWith two cracks along both sidesAnd I knew the world was overSo I took a look outsideAnd watched the fires that were reachingUp to the weather vanes and the tops of treesAnd the waiting scene and the Sunday dream -They're all waiting here for meDeli markets with their flower standsTheir pretty girls and their burning menHanging out on the hooks next to the window displaysAnd I took out my tongue, twice removed from my faceAcross a bridge and across the mountainsThrew a nickel in the fountainTo save my soul from all these troubled timesAnd all the drugs that I don't have the guts to take to soothe my mindSo I'm always soberAlways achingAlways heading towardsMass suicide, occult figurinesAnd wasted gas-station attendantsAttending to their jobsAnd a nice drive in the countryFinds a nice cliff to drop offOh, when this life just gets so gratingAll the grittiness of lifeBut don't take those pills your boyfriend gave you . . .You're too wonderful to dieAnd the last one tore a pictureFrom the pornographic pageAnd all the pleasure points attackingAll the looks of love were stagedAnd it's a lie that you've been givenThat just hurts you every daySo why should I lie here nakedWhen it's just too far awayFrom anything we could call loving -Any love worth living for?So I'll sleep out in the gutterYou can sleep here on the floorAnd when I wake up in the morningI won't forget to lock the door'Cause with a match that's mean and some gasolineYou won't see me anymore.
