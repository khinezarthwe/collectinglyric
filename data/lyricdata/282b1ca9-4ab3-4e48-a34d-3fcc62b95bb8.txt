Drones behold the life that was givenBe aware of the choices within your graspOppose the temptress who leaves you dryRedeem what was lost unleash your willHail the ones who take nothing for grantedPraise the moments of the giving dayWorship the sensation that passes by foreverConquer yourself for the kingdom of furyI want to stand in the eye of the stormI want to get struck by lightningI want our house to be set on fireFor us to walk without shelterI seek no rest I seek no shelterWhere weak dwell in the shadow of decayI want to walk forever with the stormUntil I become the prey anyway
