Let me stay and talk with you and JohnWe could laugh and tell jokes all night longAnother glass and I'm sure I could explainBut you could maybe guess that I've got to see your friend againOh yes I know it's late, oh but this boy can waitThis boy can waitOh there's nothing more that you could doI've just got to see this throughMy heart beats so fast whenever you are nearMy tongue gets tied up whenever you can hearWhen I touch your hand why do we have to hide behind these doors?If the world doesn't understand, then the world has got to learnOh yes I know it's late, oh but this boy can waitThis boy can waitOh there's nothing more that you could doI've just got to see this throughTonight, when I hold you in my armsAnd I prove that I'm a manOh well I hope you understand
