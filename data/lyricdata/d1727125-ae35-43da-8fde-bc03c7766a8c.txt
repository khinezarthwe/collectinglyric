It was so easy that nightShoulda been strong, yeah, I liedNobody gets me like youCouldn't keep hold of you thenHow could I know what you meant?There was nothing to compare toI know everything changesAll the cities and facesBut I know how I feel about youThere's a mountain between usBut there's one thing I'm sure ofThat I know how I feel about youCan we bring yesterday back around?'Cause I know how I feel about you nowI was dumb, I was wrong, I let you downBut I know how I feel about you nowAll that it takes, one more chanceDon't let our last kiss be our lastGive me tonight and I'll show youI know everything changesI don't care where it takes usCos I know how I feel about youCan we bring yesterday back around?'Cause I know how I feel about you nowI was dumb, I was wrong, I let you downBut I know how I feel about you nowNot a day passed me byNot a day passed me byWhen I don't think about youAnd there's no moving on'Cause I know you're the oneAnd I can't be without youCan we bring yesterday back around?'Cause I know how I feel about you nowI was dumb, I was wrong, I let you downBut I know how I feel about you nowCan we bring yesterday back around?'Cause I know how I feel about you nowI was dumb, I was wrong, I let you downBut I know how I feel about you nowBut I know how I feel about you nowBut I know how I feel about you now
