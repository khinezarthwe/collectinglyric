Those L.E.Ds throw their glow to the potholed groundSnap shut as they peer out from a collarHe's wearing your lipstickAnd drinking from your glassInside there's a drill shotAnd buzz through the bathroom wallTaste it from the telephone hear it in the siren wailWrite your nameIn cellophane strips,Across contours of your bloodied mouthSee a distraction, Over the black waxEvery movement, highlights in yellowSee a distraction, Over the black waxEvery movement, highlights in yellowFrom kinky buses to rickets laddersFor a thousand foot tunnel and a world undergroundStep out from your heavy breath crouchBreaking to the point pleased to meet youTake everything she's gotAnd wrap it in plastic, wrap it in plasticTake everything she's gotAnd wrap it in plastic, wrap it in plasticEncase it in song and take her ...See a distraction over the black waxEvery movement, highlights in yellowSee a distraction over the black waxEvery movement, highlights in yellowI can see a distractionThat mounts this paramount taskAnd its said with such sadnessThat the thrill is sealed in black waxThis ride, so far,Came and went, here we are,When they find you, so farIt'll take a miracle, here we are(repeat)Here we are, here we areHere we are
