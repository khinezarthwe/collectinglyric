The light is dead in your eyeSo I'll keep livin my lifeI only wanted to tryTo find my way back insideMy imitation of lifeMy litigation of lifeIt's something easy to findInside the shade of your eye(chorus):Out of the ground I rise to graceNobody knows it's just a phaseHelp me I'm out of breath againNobody knows somewhere to make it go awayPhase (x 4)I find it hard to decideThe way to make up your mindYour lips are better than mineSo you can kiss this goodbyeMy imitation of lifeMy litigation of lifeIt's something easy to findInside the shade of your eye(Chorus)It's just a phaseAnd I can't waitPhase (x 3)I know (x 3)It's just a fucking phaseI'm drained, time to fake and delay,watch the penny dropLet it go up and in then watch it rollLets all mourn 'till I survive inside you
