I've been on this road alone so long,Traveling down this slippery slope aloneNo one's ever right where you are,Looking back into your heartI can trace the lines I cross back to that initial lossAnd nothing's ever been the same,I have never loved againIt's easier, it's easier nowIt's easier, should be easier nowAnd look at me, fully grownLook at me, still aloneI been on this road alone so long,Traveling down this slippery slope aloneNo one's ever right where you are,Looking back into your heart
