This could be the sound of me tearingInto your flesh from a distanceOpening fresh woundsFor a peakAnd this could be the sound of me breakingInto your room late at nightSlitting your throatAnd cutting off your dick'Cause everyone I knowIs too comfortable with thier livesTo ever be a part of changeAnd everyone I knowIs leaving for the weekendWith tickets to the gameEverybody sounds the sameAll dirtyAll dirtyLa la la la la la la
