There's no place for me to hideThe thoughts of all the time I criedAnd felt this painThat I have knownBecause I needed just to hearThat special somethingAnd then one dayYou just appearYou said "hello""Let's make love along the way"Your name is music to my heartI'll always really love youFeel so good when I'm with youI can't believe you love me tooWith you it feels like it should feelWith you it feels so goodVocals by Don Potter
