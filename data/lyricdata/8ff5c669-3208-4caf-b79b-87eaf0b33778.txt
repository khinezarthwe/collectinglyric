I disappearI lost controlMy body's movingon it's ownI watch myselfWalk awayA foreign spirittook my placeAn empty stareits eyes are dullSo my essenceIt's riding my pulseA burst of blackA breath of smokeI disappearedI lost controlII disappearI disappearI disappearI disappearI lost controlMy body's movingon it's ownI watch myselfWalk awayA foreign spirittook my placeII disappearI disappearI disappearHow could I resistIt's all I've wantedNow I guess I've got itWhy it happened, I don't knowHope this doesn't last foreverI disappearI disappearI disappearI disappear
