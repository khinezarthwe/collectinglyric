Take a broken love songKeep it by your sideNever be lonelyFind a place to hideBy the WestwayInside the ScrubsHow long must we waitFor them killing us?Killing usThey are the loneliestThey are the loneliestThey are the loneliestThey are the loneliestStillThrough my cell windowHear the loft-boy sing"Come on, you R's"Carried on the windEvery morning I'll be singingLike a caged bird you might sayJohn, Paul, George and RingoHelp pass the hours awayFree as a bird will I beAnother dawn creeps up on meOn meThey are the loneliestThey are the loneliestThey are the loneliestThey are the loneliestLetters from faceless hatersWho'd love to see me swinging in my cellWhy, I never saw a manWho looked with such a wistful eyeUpon that little tent of bluePrisoners call the skyThey are the loneliestThey are the loneliestThey are the loneliestThey are the loneliestStillTake a broken love songKeep it by your side
