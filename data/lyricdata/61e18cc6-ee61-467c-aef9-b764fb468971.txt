With the sand in your feet I can feel the beat of your heartIt's hard to explain I won't have to again if you listen hardDon't listen to what they sayWe're going to make it our own wayWith the wind in your hair you will never compare to the rest of themLook at the sea don't tell me that tomorrow won't waitDon't listen to what they sayWe're going to make it our own way
