A thousand people on the streetThe rain is trying to drown my feetThe cold bites into every boneThe solemn faces pass me byA grey veneer on buried smilesA crowded train to take me homeIf I close my eyes a minuteSee a world and then I'm in itStand alone and grow my wingsTo take me highIf I could flySee the world beneath meFeel as though I'm set freeOh if I could flyA simple smile can change a dayAn understanding look can sayI know exactly how you feelBut we have learned to build our wallsSo very strong and very tallFor fear of what the world might stealIf I close my eyes a minuteSee a world and then I'm in itStand alone and grow my wingsTo take me highIf I could flySee the world beneath meFeel as though I'm set freeOh if I could flyIf I could flySee the world beneath meFeel as though I'm set freeOh if I could flyIf I could flySee the world beneath meFeel as though I'm set freeOh if I could fly
