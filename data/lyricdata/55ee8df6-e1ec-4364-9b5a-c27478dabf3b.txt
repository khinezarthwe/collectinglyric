Peddle light, I see it's on.I'm driving by in my fat mobile.Now I know what it's like to be a germ.It's shot down, dear, oh, buy again, it's buy again.Fun is me, yeah, it never ends.Pick it up and push it in.Rub it out, it's a soldier.Cinema goes down again.Clint does not move an inch.ESP will work it out.Open your windows, give Cindy a shout to me.Rock and roll, it's a shame that you did,All you did bored plain (?)Seek it out on the grass, fun it me, it's (Sashi?) fresh.Purple jack, purple crap, look at me and sip your sap.Pin-up boy, pity the whore that rocks a bath on a cold dish.Soon behave, I wanna be, not today, but some time real soon.Lock me up in your bedroom,Come and shout and latch the backdoor for me.Sipping wine, sipping lies.To be sure, it's a worthy cause.Fun and games, running things.I can't stay, his share is hot.Hotter than hell, sets right style.Burning rubber on the A.M. dial.(With?) me up, another time,And now I know, I'm blazed out.sipping wine - sipping liesto be sure - it's a worthy causefun and games - running things (?)I can't stay - his share is hothotter than hell - sets right styleburnin rubber - on the A.M. dialwith me up - another timeand now I know - I'm blazed outSoon behave, I wanna be, not today, but some time real soon.Fox on the run, foxy light world.Roll another one and burn the light, girl, for me.
