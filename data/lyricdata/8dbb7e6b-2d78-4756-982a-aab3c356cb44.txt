I was in the moodI had a taste for some newI wanted a special oneA city escape is a nauseaAnd i just began enjoying my selfStepping on the ground as the promise sang?The minute i sawYou're crashing the partyOh you're crashing the party(2x)Try to escape the feelingNo thinking no seeingI could just shited awayI didn't want to goI didn't want to stayFriends try to cheer me upBut with no luckI said that i will be okIf only i could (could)You're crashing the partyOh you're crashing the party(6x)So would you just get out of my faceYou're crashing all the partyBecause i can't help to look your wayI loose this night to heartache(2x)You're crashing the partyOh you're crashing the party(3x)
