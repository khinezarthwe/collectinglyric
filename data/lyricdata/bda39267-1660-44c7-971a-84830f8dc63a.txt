Last go roundSeemed like my trail's nearly endingBeen locked upGoing out of my headLast go aroundMy trail's nearly overBeen locked upGoing out of my mindJesus of nothingJudas to touchesOn my wayGoing out of my headMy trail's nearly endedThose blocking out the sunI turn the ocean overSee nowhere to runI've run so far alreadyThe last go aroundTill the end of my mindJesus of nothingJudas to touchesLast go roundGoing out of my mindOn my wayGoing out of my headLast go roundGoing out of my mindIt's my last go roundGoing out of my headMy trail's nearly ended[?]
