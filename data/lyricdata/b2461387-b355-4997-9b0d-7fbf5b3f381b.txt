Gonna find a way to cure this lonelinessYeah I'll find a way to cure the painIf I said that you're my friendAnd our love would never endHow long before I had your trust againI opened up the doors when it was cold outsideHoping that you'd find your own way inBut how can I protect youOr try not to neglect youWhen you won't take the love I have to giveI bought me an illusionAn I put it on the wallI let it fill my head with dreamsAnd I had to have them allBut oh the taste is never so sweetAs what you'd believe it isWell I guess it never isIt's these prejudiced illusionsThat pump the bloodTo the heart of the bizYou know I never thoughtThat it could take so longYou know I never knew how to be strongYeah, I let you shape meBut I feel as though you raped me'Cause you climbed inside my worldAnd in my songsNow I've closed the doorTo keep the cold outsideSeems somehow I've found the will to liveBut how can I forget youOr try not to reject youWhen we both know it takes time to forgive (yea)Sweetness is a virtueAnd you lost your virtue long agoYou know I'd like to hurt youBut my conscience always tells me noYou could sell your body on the streetTo anyone whom you might meetWho'd love to try and get insideAnd bust your innocence open wide'Cause my baby's got a locomotiveMy baby's gone off the trackMy baby's got a locomotiveGotta peel the bitch off my backI know it looks like I'm insaneTake a closer look I'm not to blame (no)Gonna have some fun with my frustrationGonna watch the big screen in my headI'd rather take a detour'Cause this road ain't getting clearerYour train of thought has cut me off againBetter tame that boy 'cause he's a wild oneBetter tame that boy for he's a manSweetheart don't make me laughYou's getting too big for your pantsAnd I's think maybe you shouldCut out while you canYou can use you illusionLet it take you where it mayWe live and learnAnd then sometimes it's best to walk awayMe I'm just here hanging onIt's my only place to stay at leastFor now anywayI've worked too hard for my illusionsJust to throw them all awayI'm taking time for quiet consolationIn passing by this love that's passed awayI know it's never easySo why should you believe meWhen I've always got so many things to sayCalling off the dogs a simple choice is made'Cause playful heartsCan sometimes be enragedYou know I tried to wake youI mean how long could it take youTo open up your eyes and turn the pageKindness is a treasureAnd it's one towards me you've seldom shownSo I'll say it for good measureTo all the ones like you I've knownYa know I'd like to shave your headAnd all my friends could paint it red'Cause love to me's a two way streetAn all I really want is peaceBut my baby's got a locomotiveMy baby's gone off the trackMy baby's got a locomotiveGotta peel the bitch off my backI know it looks like I'm insaneTake a closer look I'm not to blame (no)Affection is a blessingCan you find it in your sordid heartI tried to keep this thing togetherBut the tremor tore my pad apartYeah I know it's hard to faceWhen all we've worked for's gone to wasteBut you're such a stupid womanAnd I'm such a stupid manBut love like time's got its own plans'Cause my baby's got a locomotiveMy baby's gone off the trackMy baby's got a locomotiveGot ta peel the bitch off my backI know it looks like I'm insaneTake a closer look I'm not to blameYeahIf love is blind I guessI'll buy myself a caneLove's so strange (repeat)
