You're hoping tomorrow's never sewnBut you're singing the only words you knowWould you cry if I lied, told a taleI chose yaYou're ringing the only wedding bellAnd we're swimming the seas we know so wellI tried to stay in line in our deathsIn our headsOh, but your wish is my command...Oh, is your heart still mine to sail?I had yours, now here's mine.I chose yaYou're ringing the only wedding bellAnd we're swimming the seas we know so wellI tried to stay in line in our deathsIn our headsOh, but your wish is my command...
