There's someone down below blowing you a kissThey watch from their windowsAs all arms fall to their sides, and all eyes fixOn the death of tomorrowAnd you found everything you needTo make a life completeCompletely revolting, and they have safety and reliefFor sale up the streetI see you in line everydayYou had time to waste and I'm not sorrySuch a basket case, hide the cutleryI had time to kill, it's dead and buriedYou've got guts to spill, but no one trustworthyThese creatures are waking up in these dark treesWaiting like vulturesEyes roll back, turn white in time to feedThey salivate in hungerFor you and everything they needTo make a death completeCompletely unnatural and salvation liesBehind those dead eyesThat watch you while you sleep every nightAnd you had time to waste and I'm not sorrySuch a basket case, hide the cutleryI had time to kill its dead and buriedYou've got guts to spill but no one trustworthyYou had time to waste and I'm not sorrySuch a basket case, hide the cutleryI had time to kill its dead and buriedYou've got guts to spill but no one trustworthy
