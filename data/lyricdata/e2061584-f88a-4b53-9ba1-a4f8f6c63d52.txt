All For YouYou take your orders from the queen of insanityBut the contract said it was you and meI sacrificied family, my children and my soulTo give you what you wanted, complete controlYou tried to kill the love and to isolateBut then you turn around, like it's not too lateYou justify your actions, forget what you have doneBut no more blackmail and no more funDay in, day out negativityBeat me down with your own familyYour bloodline runs in a world of hateOf dirty white lies and to dominateLonely people just trying to find their wayLooking for something, but this is the price I payYou thought I was stupid, you thought I was blindYou had me by the balls but your well ran dryYou took it all for granted and tried to bring me downBut look at what you've done, take a good look around
