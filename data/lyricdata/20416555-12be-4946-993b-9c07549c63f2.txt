Well it starts as a jokeLike a stick in the spokesOr removing a bolt from the brakesThen a bicycle flipsCrushing ribs, smashing hipsAnd he broke every bone in his faceThen you're out of controlAnd you can't fill the holeThat was left by the thrill of the chaseYou're a right piece of workAll the flakes go berserkHave you forgotten how good they taste?You're my kind of guy'Cos I like your styleAnd you sound as horrible as meAnd I don't mindIf you're unkindYou're reminding me of meAs the bycicle raceGathers speed, gathers paceAnd you feel that you're going too fastThere's a word to the wiseYou should take some advice'Cos the nice guys always finish lastYou're my kind of guy'Cos I like your styleAnd you sound as horrible as meAnd I don't mindIf you're unkindYou're reminding me of meYou're my kind of guy'Cos I like your styleAnd you sound as horrible as meAnd heads will rollAs it takes its tollOn you and me
