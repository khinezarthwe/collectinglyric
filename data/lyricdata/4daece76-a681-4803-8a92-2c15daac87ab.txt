Far out at seabathed in breezeNow only ghostswe haunt living dreamsOut on the coastthe coast is the mostthat we'll ever seeOut on the coastwe'll sit and boastthat "it's all we need"Wade through the sandand find the romancethat we know we needBoys of MelodyAnd they'll follow meAnd I'll sing harmonyAnd with our songmarching alongfew feign a frownor forget their townsWe proceed in stained bed sheetsand hang on our sleevesthat "we're happy"Sung with a chorus of tonesbacked by drums and dronesWe march towards the seaAs we reach the edgeI sing a new lament"the boys are here with me"Boys of melodyAnd they'll follow meAnd I'll sing harmonyAnd "it's all we need""The boys are here with me""We're happy"
