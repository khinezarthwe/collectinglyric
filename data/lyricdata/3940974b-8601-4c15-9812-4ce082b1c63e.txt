In this dayA time of metal magicWe need rock and rollWe need PanteraI didn't want to touch youSince we were both 16Didn't want to take you downAnd show you what love meansNow is the timeThis is the placeGet ready to take a chanceWe don't have a minute to wasteRide my rocketWear me outRide my rocketMake me twist and shoutRide my rocketGive me all of your loveRide my rocketI just can't get enoughYou leave me breathlessWhen you walk byThe way you move it, girlMakes me satisfiedYou might be the bestThat I've ever hadIt's gotta be good, girlCause it looks so badRide my rocketWear me outRide my rocketMake me twist and shoutRide my rocketGive me all of your loveRide my rocketI just can't get enough-Solo-Feels so goodMakes my heart breakEvery time you touch meI explode into flames-Solo-Ride my rocketWear me outRide my rocketMake me twist and shoutRide my rocketGive me all of your loveRide my rocketI just can't get enough
