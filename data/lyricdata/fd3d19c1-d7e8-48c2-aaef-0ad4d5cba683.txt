I lie here alone and wonder whyThat I come alive, just before I have to hide.'cause I believe I'm losing my nerveBut could I ever do better than this'cause all I ever wanted was a place to call my homeTo shelter me when I am there and to miss me when I'm goneAll I ever wanted was a place to call my ownWhere stars may dance and sun still shinesand the storms feel free to roamI listen if only for a whileBut I can't decide if I'm aware that I'm on trial'cause I believe I'm losing my nerveBut could I ever do better than this'cause all I ever wanted was a place to call my homeTo shelter me when I am there and to miss me when I'm goneAll I ever wanted was a place to call my ownWhere stars may dance and sun still shinesand the storms feel free to roamIf there's a way to a liberty then lead me straight to itIf there's a path or a door I missed , then show me now,well show me this'cause all I ever wanted was a place to call my homeTo shelter me when I am there and to miss me when I'm goneAll I ever wanted was a place to call my ownWhere stars may dance and sun still shinesand the storms feel free to roamfeel free when I am gone
