It's late at night and the world's asleepAnd I'm tryin' not to thinkI take some pills 'cause my mind bleedsI'm thinkin', "What is wrong with me?"Because the only thing I know about honestyIs every lie I've told, that you believedThat I'm afraid to be aloneI'm afraid that one day you'll find outAnd you'll be amazed at the secrets I keepYou'll be amazed at my mouth full of liesBut I'm too afraid to come clean'Cause my life's the flame in a house of cardsNow I can't look you in your eyesBecause the guilt is killin' meI try to disconnect my heart againJust so I can breatheI want to be myself again but I just can't'Cause I'm afraid to be aloneI'm afraid that one day you'll find outAnd you'll be amazed at the secrets I keepYou'll be amazed at my mouth full of liesBut I'm too afraid to come clean'Cause my life's the flame in a house of cardsIt's such a shame what I've become, after years of breakin' downMy whole life has come undone 'cause I'm tryin' to fake it allI know that you love someone, but that someone isn't meOr is this me?And you'll be amazed at the secrets I keepYou'll be amazed at my mouth full of liesBut I'm too afraid to come clean'Cause my life's the flame in a house of cardsYou'll be amazedYou'll be amazed
