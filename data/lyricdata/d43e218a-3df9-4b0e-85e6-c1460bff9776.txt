Four A.M., two hours to goI'm wearing out a lonely glow.I miss you more than I can know.Here I am, here I am, won't you keep me?I've got my hands at redemption's sideWhose scars are bigger than these doubts of mine.I'll fit all of these monstrosities insideIt'll come alive, come aliveWith my fist down at your feetI was running out of mysteriesInsecure and incompleteHere I am, here I amWon't you get me?I've got my hands at redemption's sideWhose scars are bigger than these doubts of mine.I'll fit all of these monstrosities inside and I'll come alive,Come alive, alive, come aliveMy fears have worn me outMy fears have worn me outAnd my fears have worn me outMy fears have worn me, worn me out.I've got my hands at redemption's sideWhose scars are bigger than these doubts of mineI'll fit all of these monstrosities insideI'll come aliveAt redemption's sideBigger than these doubts of mineI'll fit all of these monstrosities insideI'll come alive, come alive
