So far away from me to seeWhen no relief is at the door terminallyI've no intention to sing a sad songBut everything I wanna say never felt so wrongAnd every hour in my day feels like a weekThose days you find yourself in a place without a light...Sometimes you might find you feel a little likeYou're on the wrong side of lifeWhere's no light. But it's gonna turn aroundSometime so nevermindThe place you thought you'd never beClose to the bone but still too far away to seeYou've got the voice and all the intentionBut your head wont't pay your heart no attentionAnd your heart just won't relay the news down to your feet'My my' what a silly thing to think you're the only one what you thinking of'My my' what a silly thing to think you're the only one to feel lonely
