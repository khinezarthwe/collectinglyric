Pick away at my bones, There's nothing left to seeI've been forever drowning in what you want to beThe soonest I'd be leaving isn't quick enough for meI don't need a reason to be freeBreathe my life untill you seeThere's nothing left for meI've wasted far too longFeel nothing after a timeDon't know why, down my spineGrieving is unrefinedCan't cross the lineI look for a signCan you conceal the way you feelAnd what you steal from what is real andBreathe my life untill you seeThere's nothing left for meI've wasted far too longwasted far to longBreathe my life untill you seeThere's nothing left for meI've wasted far too long
