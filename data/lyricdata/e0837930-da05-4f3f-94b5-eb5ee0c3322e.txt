Deep river runs its courseTo a warm horizonShadows of falling leavesOctober moon and rusty skiesEver changing feelingsThe seeds of autumn in my mindThe hiding sun, like the hiding sunFeels like it's just begunThe hiding sun, like the hiding sunWaiting for summer sunHiding summer's age no moreNo more leaves in summer skyTurning dark on empty car lotsWhen summer was my only friendSo you're back this way againWinter's one breath awaySo you're back this way againWinter's one breath awayIt's turning cold...Like the hiding sun, like the hiding sunFeels like its just begunThe hiding sun, like the hiding sunWaiting for summer sunThe hiding sun, like the hiding sunFeels like it's just begunThe hiding sun, like the hiding sunWaiting for summer sunThe hiding sun, like the hiding sunFeels like its just begun.
