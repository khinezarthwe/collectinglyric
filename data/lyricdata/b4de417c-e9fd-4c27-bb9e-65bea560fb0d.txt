That journey-a call me quick,That journey-a call my name,That journey-a have it's way,an' have me wonderin' all my daysThat journey-a call me quick,That journey-a call my name,That journey-a have it's way,an' have me wonderin' all my days.I can't stay home, I gotta keep movin,I gotta keep doin', I gotta get out,I gotta roam, it's somethin' that moves me,It's somethin' that uses me without a doubt,'cause somewhere abstract coincidence happens,see someone in passin' while out and about,next thing I know I'm happily travelin',puttin' in action ideas that I mouth,cause I speak it and do it, talk it and walk it,I'm so bad about it, I shout it out loud,but try to stay open, the forces in motion,They keep me on course, it's just clear that i've found (?),Imprissoned in flesh and reality's blesses,that made manifest every woman and child,I'll keep on expressin' reality's lessons,explorin' my prison until I'm let out.That journey-a call me quick,That journey-a call my name,That journey-a have it's way,an' have me wonderin' all my daysThat journey-a call me quick,That journey-a call my name,That journey-a have it's way,have me wonderin' all my days.Travelin' East and West, on every known highway,South to North carryin' that torch until I'm old and grey.Well in the mean time inbetween I'm pushin' through this,I said in the main time inbetween I'm on my duty.Sometimes I get beat up, sometimes I'm the beater,Sometimes man my feet hurt from walkin' so long,Sometimes I'm defeated, sometimes I get cheated,Sometimes I just need it, 'cause sometimes I'm wrong,So the question's repeated, why even try?When there's rocks in the road, pot-holes in the lawn,The victory's sweeter when obstacles either,Are side-stepped or crushed on the way to the door,So I go on my own, have faith in the road,I can share that control cause I'm never alone.I hear the creator speak to me through wispers,On winds the voices of friends and of foes,I listen to omens, the things that he shows me,Shows that he knows me and helps me along,And follow him closely, where he goes mostly,Guidin' my path on this map 'till I'm goneThat journey-a call me quick,That journey-a call my name,That journey-a have it's way,an' have me wonderin' all my daysThat journey-a call me quick,That journey-a call my name,That journey-a have it's way,an' have me wonderin' all my days.And when they lay me down,To rest in my Earthly grave,And when they lay me down,Navigate that big sky wave.But in the meantime I, I got my duty,In the meantime inbetween time I, I got to do this,In the meantime inbetween time I, I'm pushin through this,In the meantime inbetween time I, I got my duty.I got my.. I got my, I got my duty. I got my duty I know!
