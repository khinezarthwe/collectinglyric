Sometimes I feel all aloneI know it's such a strange feeling'Cause I used to have so many friendsThe few I have left, I hold them close to my heart'Cause tomorrow I might be all aloneI might be all alone, oh, I might be all alone, oohI might be all alone, oh, I might be all aloneThere are choices to makeBut I feel scared and I'm sad'Cause I'm feeling there ain't no trust at allWoke up, had it all, then come nightfallI've got nothing left but heart shaken downLeft with nothing at all, oh, left with nothing at allPlease, be there, I'm alone, oohPlease, be there, I'm alone, ohhPlease, be there, I'm alonePlease, be there, I'm alonePlease, be there I'm alone
