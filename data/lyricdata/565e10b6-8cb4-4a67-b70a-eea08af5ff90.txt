I'm missing your bedI never sleepAvoiding the spots where we'd have to speakAnd this bottle of beastIs taking me homeI'm cuddling closeTo blankets and sheetsBut you're not alone, and you're not discreetMake sure I know who's taking you homeI'm reading your note over againAnd there's not a word that I comprehendExcept when you signed itI will love you always and foreverWell as for now I'm gonna hear the saddest songsAnd sit alone and wonderHow you're making outBut as for me, I wish that I was anywhere, with anyoneMaking outI'm missing your laughHow did it break?And when did your eyes begin to look fake?I hope you're as happy as you're pretendingI'm cuddling closeTo blankets and sheetsAnd I am aloneIn my defeatI wish I knew you were safely at homeI'm missing your bedI never sleepAvoiding the spots where we'd have to speakAnd this bottle of beast is taking me homeWell as for now I'm gonna hear the saddest songsAnd sit alone and wonderHow you're making outBut as for me, I wish that I was anywhere, with anyoneMaking outYour hair, it's everywhereScreaming infidelitiesAnd taking its wearYour hair, it's everywhereScreaming infidelitiesAnd taking its wearYour hair is everywhereScreaming infidelitiesAnd taking its wearYour hair, it's everywhereScreaming infidelitiesAnd taking its wear
