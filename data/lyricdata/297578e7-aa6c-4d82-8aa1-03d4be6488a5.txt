The streets are wetAnd they shine like goldAs they're linedFor the big paradeAll to sell is here to be soldI hopeI might see her todayAll who could talkSay she shines like she doesAnd that she would like toTake me outAnd show me aroundThere seemsSo much of this placeAll who could talkSay she shines like she doesAnd that she would like toBreath me inAnd turn me roundIt seems like there's no other way
