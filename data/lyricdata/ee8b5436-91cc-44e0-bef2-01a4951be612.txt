When I like you it's total revenge.I want to but I can pretendthat I don't need to be your side again.Wrap me up in a plastic case.Pat me down with you're warm embrace.I want to know where you've laid your face at night for all these years.You're a problem that I can't abide.I can sleep well if only I tried.But I stay up and dream of a bride to be.Oh me! Oh my! Give it up!I can't wait no more.I am stuck on your bedroom floorwith the thought that I may not be as great as those who came before.There's a man assigned to meand he checks on my stability.We discuss you every week.Then I rinse and rinse, repeat.But maybe, I can show you, baby!Maybe, I can relax for good, woah, baby!I can show you...maybe...baby.There's a man assigned to meand he checks on my stability.We discuss you every week.Then I rinse and rinse, repeat.And he charges by the tear,'till I weep no more, strictly out of fear,that I can't afford your love.And the moon just burns above.Okay...
