People stared at the makeup on his faceLaughed at his long black hair, his animal graceThe boy in the bright blue jeansJumped up on the stageLady stardust sang songsOf darkness and disgraceAnd he was all right, the band was all togetherYes, he was all right, the song went on foreverYes, he was awful niceReally quite out of sightAnd he sang all night longFemme fatales emerged from shadowsTo watch this creature fairBoys stood upon their chairsTo make their point of viewI smiled sadly for a love I could not obeyLady stardust sang songsOf darkness and dismayAnd he was all right, the band was all togetherYes, he was all right, his song went on foreverAnd he was awful niceReally quite paradiseAnd he sang all night longOh, how I sighed when they asked if I knew his nameOh there was all right, the band was all togetherYes, he was all right, and his song went on foreverHe was awful niceReally quite paradiseHe sang all night long
