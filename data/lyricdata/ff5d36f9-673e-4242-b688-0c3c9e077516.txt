Everything I say falls awayLike the fade on the radio songAnd everything I try passed me byLike the tide seems to rise, then it's goneStill, there's something to be saidFor company in bed this time of morningSee? I knew we'd agreeHow can anyone denyThe benefits of lying with your friendWe'll try it againSometimes when I'm by myselfI can't find myselfAnd there's no one thereSometimes I can see myselfI can be myselfWith a friend, nowEvery day I rub both my eyesAnd my mind fills with complicationsAnd everywhere I goPassed by slowFading moments and aspirationsSometimes when I'm by myselfI can't find myselfAnd there's no one thereSometimes I can see myselfI can be myselfWith a friend, nowSometimes when I'm by myselfI can't find myselfAnd there's no one thereSometimes I can be myselfI can see myselfWith a friend, nowA friend, nowI'll never know you like you know yourselfYou'll never know me like I know myselfI'll never know you like you know yourselfYou'll never know me like I know myselfI'll never know you like you know yourselfYou'll never know me like I know myselfI'll never know you like I know myselfYou'll never know me like you know yourself
