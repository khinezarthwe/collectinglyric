I don't know the sound of my father's voiceI don't even know how he says my nameBut it plays out like a song on a jukebox in a barIn the back of my head till it's worrying machineAnd in the cotton fields out by the house where I was bornThe leaves burn like effigies of my kinThe trains run like snakes through the Pentecostal pinesFilled up with cotton and dime store ginOh Jacksonville, how you burden my soulHow you hold all my dreams captiveJacksonville, how you play with my mindOh my heart goes back, suffocating on the pinesIn JacksonvilleThe end, the end, the endAll the cars are lined up on a Saturday nightWith a sky full of nothing but moonAnd I lose my reflection in a bottle of wineTill the morning comes down and I ain't nothing but youAt the diner in the morning for a plate of eggsThe waitress tries to give me change I say, "Nah, it's cool. Just keep it"I read up my news, I start thinking about herAnd I wonder if anybody here besides me has got any decent secretsOh Jacksonville, how you burden my soulHow you hold all my dreams captiveJacksonville, how you play with my mindOh my heart goes back, suffocating on the pinesIn JacksonvilleThe end, the end, the end
