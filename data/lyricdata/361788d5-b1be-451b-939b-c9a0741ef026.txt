Maybe I could fallBaby, I could fall apartTo conceal, to protect, to serve and to rejectI'm turning into somethingGo all the way to the rightI'm going past, I'm going past, I'm going past the next two lightsChorusHit the streetsThey talk to meA fickle beast who's nice todayIt's such a waste, another daySuch a waste, But it feels greatBut it feels greatIt feels greatEverything has taken a turnIn disguise as what I wantI can leave herI cantileverBut I keep coming back for moreI'm turning into somethingGo all the way to the rightI'm going past, I'm going past, I'm going past the next two lightsChorus x 2But it feels great todayIt may be a wasteAnother dayIt feels greatIt may be a wasteAnother dayBut it feels greatIt feels great
