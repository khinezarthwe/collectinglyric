From the moment the lights went offEverything had changedLie awake in an empty roomIn my head it all feels the sameLike the taste of the day you leftIt still lingers on my breathAnd the dampness of tears that leftThat stain where you had weptAll alone with the negligeeThat still hangs off of my bedI keep meaning to give it awayBut I just leave it there insteadNo need to cry about itI cannot live without itEvery time I wind up back at your doorWhy do you do this to me?You penetrate right through meEvery time I wind up back at your door3 more days 'til I see your faceI'm afraid it's far too muchCook a meal and fix up the placeDial your number, hang it upIf I took you for grantedI apologize for acting toughYou're my reason for livingAnd there's no way I'm giving up, ohNo need to cry about itI cannot live without itEvery time I wind up back at your doorWhy do you do this to me?You penetrate right through meEvery time I wind up back at your doorNow every evening is a bitter fightAnd I'm eating home alone on a Friday nightAnd I know what your friends say:He's just wasting your love and timeI will never let you change your mindNo need to cry about itI cannot live without itEvery time I wind up back at your doorWhy do you do this to me?You penetrate right through meEvery time I wind up back at your doorNo need to cry about itI may just die without itEvery time I wind up back at your doorWhy do you do this to me?You penetrate right through meEvery time I wind up back at your doorEvery time I wind up back at your doorSay, every time I wind up back at your door
