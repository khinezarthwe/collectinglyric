On the cusp of vessel 18A look of terror in our eyesThe moonlight licked the face of dangerInnocence made us like soldiersUntouchable and goldenThe quilt of darkness dotted with our teardropsI know you're sad I'm leavingSo this may hurt a littleBut, girl, look from your window late tonightYou think my heart is frozenWhile yours is slowly grievingYou'll see the boy you loved start burning in the skyWe were a dozen to the projectWith a galaxy of questionsAnd all we heard was lies about the truthNo choice but be obedientLike prisoners of warCaught on the wrong side of morality and youthWe thought about our loved onesTallied 50 on our foreheadsWith the pen your mother gave me in the springThe sun beat at the windowsWithin an hour James had crackedLeft the ship and died still clinging to the wingsStart burning in the skyStart burning in the skyStart burning in the skyStart burning in the sky
