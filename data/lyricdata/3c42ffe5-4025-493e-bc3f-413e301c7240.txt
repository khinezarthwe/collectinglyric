Carve your heart out yourselfHopelessness is your cellSince you've drawn out these linesAre you protected from trying times?Man it takes a silly girl to lie about the dreams she hasLord it takes a lonely one to wish that she had never dreamt at allOh Lord, now, there you go with hope againOh, you're so sure I'll be leaving in the endDig a ditch deep enoughTo keep you clear of the sunYou've been burned more than onceYou don't think much of trustMan it takes a silly girl to lie about the dreams she hasLord it takes a lonely one to wish that she had never dreamt at allOh Lord, now, there you go with hope againBut I'll be sure your secret is safe with meOh, you're so sure I'll be leaving in the endTreating me like I'm already goneBut I'm not, I will stay where you are alwaysI will stay, I will stay, I will stay (all of now)(repeat to fade out)
