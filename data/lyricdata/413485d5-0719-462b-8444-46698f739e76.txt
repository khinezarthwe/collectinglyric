On the town beneath your windowI'm in love and there's no where to goThey're on my tail so please don't fail meBut if I'm found they'll surely hang meI'm always on the runAlways on the runOn the town beneath your windowThe cops around their guns all wrapped in goldIf it's the end then please don't hate meI need your kiss or else just waste me darlingI'm always on the runAlways on the run
