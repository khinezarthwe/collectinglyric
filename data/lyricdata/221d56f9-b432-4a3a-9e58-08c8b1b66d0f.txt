You weave your spellYour eyes they beckon meYour lips they speak, lies and miseryI know it's wrong, but I can't turn awayThe flames draw near, they're telling me to stay(Into the fire) I'm falling(Into the fire) I'm fallingInto the fireYour love burns bright, and yet the flames are coldThis time I fear, you won't be back no moreWhen will it end, your love consumes my soulInto the fire, I'm being tempted once more(Into the fire) I'm falling(Into the fire) I'm fallingInto the fireTake me back where I came fromDon't wanna see your face no moreYou broke my heart, now it's not the sameI'm falling, againI'm falling, againInto the fire
