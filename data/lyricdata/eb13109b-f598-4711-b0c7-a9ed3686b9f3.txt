Truth is a whisper and only a choiceNobody hears above this noiseAlways a risk when you try to believeI know there's so much more than meYeah I got caught in the ruse of the worldIt's just a promise no one ever keepsAnd now it's changing while you sleepAnd no one can seeChorus:You know all I amFeel this moment in youYou know all I amCan you teach me to believe in somethingSometimes you choke on the smell just to breatheI need to question what I needRhythm of silence that beats through your mindStill you forget what you denyYeah I got caught in the ruse of the worldIt's just a promise no one ever keepsAnd now it's changing in your sleepAnd no one can seeChorus:You know all I amFeel this moment in youYou know all I amCan you teach me to believe in somethingWho's the one you answer toDo you listen when he speaksOr is everything for youAnd do you find it hard to sleepOr is it easy on your ownWill you ever find some peaceBefore you're goneChorus:You know all I amFeel this moment in youYou know all I amCan you teach me to believe in something
