I couldn't sleep last nightMy ears were ringing in my headBest friends with the boogie manI may be better off here deadRunning on empty once againToo tired for tears I dreadSink deep into those magic dreamsWhile I blast off in my bedAnd you know I played it all in hereWhere everyone hides their darkest shades of fearsAnd I threw my whole night down the drainYou know cause everyone says that I'm not the sameSince I changed my nameThree hours later and I'm staring at the ceiling stillZanax does nothing more but calm the sleeping thrillTurning the pillows round and round to find the cold spot for my headAh, bless my only friendAnd you know I played it all in hereWhere everyone hides their darkest shades of fearsAnd I threw my whole night down the drainYou know cause everyone says that I'm not the sameAnd everyone turns tricks for fickle fameI feel my body's lost controlMy knees get weak as I drift awayAnd it gets darker, darkerDreaming's where I amAnd you know I played it all in hereWhere everyone hides their darkest shades of fearsAnd I threw my whole night down the drainAnd you know I played it all in hereWhere everyone hides their darkest shades of fearsAnd I threw my whole night down the drainYou know cause everyone says that i'm not the sameSince I changed my name
