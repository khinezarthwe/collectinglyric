Your sorry eyes, they cut through boneThey make it hard to leave you aloneLeave you here wearing your woundsWaving your guns at somebody newBaby, you're lost, baby, you're lostBaby, you're a lost causeThere's too many people you used to knowThey see you coming, they see you goThey know your secrets and you know theirsThis town is crazy, but nobody caresBaby, you're lost, baby, you're lostBaby, you're a lost causeI'm tired of fighting, I'm tired of fightingFighting for a lost causeThere's a place where you are goingYou ain't never been beforeThere's no one laughing at your back nowNo one standing at your doorIs that what you thought love was for?Baby, you're lost, baby, you're lostBaby, you're a lost causeI'm tired of fighting, I'm tired of fightingFighting for a lost cause
