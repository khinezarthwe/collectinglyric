It starts with a canvasA starchy, blinding whiteThen comes the flash of illuminationAnd the tools to record the plightSo I begin drowning the surfaceWith a swamp of acrylic swirlsI'll get it right this timeThis time it will lastLook at the world I've createdWatch it as it turns like a topFrom the oceans and tidesTo the clouds and blue skiesIt's more than you could everDream to affordIt ends with a loose threadAnd a curious handLike a boy who stumbles uponHis father's gunIt's housed in a sock drawerNext to cigarettes and cheap pornHe loads the chamber withOne destined shotHis father always regretsHe left the safety offLook at the world I've createdWatch it as it turns like a topFrom the oceans and tidesTo the clouds and blue skiesIt's more than you could everDreamLook at the world I've createdWatch it as it turns like a topFrom the malls and estatesTo the smoke stacks and freewaysIt's much more than you could affordYou've wasted this giftOf beauty and scienceAnd now my voice won't be ignoredI'll pull back the blindsAnd open all your eyesLet the sun drown you all
