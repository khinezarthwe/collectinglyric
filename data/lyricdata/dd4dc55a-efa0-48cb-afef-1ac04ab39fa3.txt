Leave me aloneLeave me aloneLeave me aloneI'm fineI'll be fine until the morning comesThen unmask me in the blistering sunOh let me goJust let me goJust let me goor I'llBurst in front of your eyesThen collect myself from the groundAnd when I goAnd when I goJust let me goLike a lightFlickering out in the skiesLost as fast as was foundEverything's easy when you've never had to chooseBut the balance has shifted and we're forced to loseLike the sun and the moon I will circle you 'til you bloomI will crush I will maul I will burn until I get to youLay lowDon't let me know when it's realWill they quietly follow me here?Will they take me as their own?Now I will hold you I will keep you I'll control my loveUntil it folds in my handsBut I'll build it back to the topEverything's easy when you've never had to chooseBut the balance has shifted and we're forced to loseLike the sun and the moon I will circle you 'til you bloomI will crush I will maul I will burn until I get to youFeel it rainFeel it rainWe're aliveFeel it rain
