We lived in a dogfish egg caseYou could barely call it homeSorry little lot no roof on topBut the fish left us aloneTry a little more said the girl nextDoor it's time to roamMad Lizzy Crumbs blind cobblersThumbs were a sight to beholdShe was a rum old slapper and we alwaysTried to get her pants off when she phonedLeft her cap by the sink it's not what you thinkOh take me homeNow we know where we're going babyWe can lay back and enjoy the rideTake in the sights and drown in our sensesLove is the law so take me deep insideStrap on Sally chased us down the alleyWe feared for our behindsOasis was a shop with shoes so hotThey were sure to blow your mindRunning so fast I can taste the pastOh take me homeNow we know where we're going babyWe can lay back and enjoy the rideTake in the sights and drown in our sensesLove is the law so take me deep insideThese waters run deep it's clear my little oneBlue velvet star sky not a soundThe light in your eyes the smile on your ruby lipsTells me my lost soul is foundNow we know where we're going babyWe can lay back and enjoy the rideTake in the sights and drown in our sensesLove is the law so take me deep inside
