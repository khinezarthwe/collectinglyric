Stuck inside these four wallsSent inside foreverNever seeing no one nice againLike you, mamaYou, mamaYouIf I ever get out of hereThought of giving it all awayTo a registered charityAll I need is a pint a dayIf I ever get outta hereIf we ever get outta hereWell, the rain exploded with a mighty crashAs we fell into the sunAnd the first one said to the second one there"I hope you're having fun"Band on the runBand on the runAnd the jailer man and sailor SamWere searching everyoneFor the band on the runBand on the runBand on the runBand on the runWell, the undertaker drew a heavy sighSeeing no one else had comeAnd a bell was ringing in the village squareFor the rabbits on the runBand on the runBand on the runAnd the jailer man and sailor SamWere searching everyoneFor the band on the runBand on the runWe're the band on the runBand on the runBand on the runBand on the runWell, the night was falling as the desert worldBegan to settle downIn the town, they're searching for us everywhereBut we never will be foundBand on the runBand on the runAnd the county judge who held a grudgeWill search forever moreFor the band on the runBand on the runBand on the runBand on the runBand on the runBand on the runBand on the runBand on the run
