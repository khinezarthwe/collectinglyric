You fall before us, shattered in vainYou thrash about us, screaming in painTortured and flaming, you're on your kneesyou fucking whores, it's us you must pleaseWe'll give you merciless... death!!!Stand up and bang, till you fall the floorThe sound is so deafening, it can't be ignoredThe place is burning, your minds are destroyedDevastated and helpless, you're left here to dieThe angels has landed - judgement has comeYour death has arrived, faster than someThe darkness descending upon heaven's gatesYour soul is now promised and you know thatWe'll wait!!!
