Kissing a strange hand, my city like street lamps fadeOn the edge of an answer you weigh lust beginnings are madeLover, forgive me, my guilt is my only crimeAnd I'll carry it round 'til it breaks me down every timeThis is the time of night when the moonlight shines downAnd we can reveal who we truly areWithin the darkest, most depravedOf joysIf you're afraid to say, but you'd like to tryJust give me the safe word and take your handAnd smack me in the mouthMy loveFrom hunger you call, and it falls upon the ears of faithA half open mouth and the whole truth that no one would takePretend all you want, you can cry to your heart's own beatWe will take love and swear upon the things that we just can't keepThis is the time of night when the moonlight shines downAnd we can reveal who we truly areWithin the darkest, most depravedOf joysIf you're afraid to say, but you'd like to tryJust give me the safe word and take your handAnd smack me in the mouthMy loveThis is the time of night when the moonlight shines downAnd we can reveal who we truly areWithin the darkest, most depravedOf joysIf you're afraid to say, but you'd like to tryJust give me the safe word and take your handAnd smack me in the mouthMy love
