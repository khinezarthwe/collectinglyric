If I am alive this time next yearWill I have arrived in time to share?And mine is about as good this farAnd I'm still applied to what you areAnd I am joining all my thoughts to youAnd I'm preparing every part for youAnd I heard from the trees a great paradeAnd I heard from the hills a band was madeAnd will I be invited to the sound?And will I be a part of what you've made?And I am throwing all my thoughts awayAnd I'm destroying every bet I've madeAnd I am joining all my thoughts to youAnd I'm preparing every part for you
