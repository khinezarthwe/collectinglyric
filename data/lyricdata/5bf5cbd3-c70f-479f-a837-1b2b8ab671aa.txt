How would you feel if I was to kneel right down,at your feet, right now?Is the way it's going to be fromnow until to forever,Let's have less of getting clever with meWho would you blame for blowing the flame right out?Is it me?There is no doubt I can do what I want to do fromnow until forever,Let's have less of getting clever with meYou're wasting your timeand my time as well la la la living a lie,I guess that time will tell.You're making excuses'bout the things you never done.Walking in circles, blinded by the sun.Blinded the sun.Who would you blame for blowing the flame right out?Is it me?There is no doubt I can do what I want to do fromnow until forever,Let's have less of getting clever with meYou're wasting your timeand my time as well la la la living a lie,I guess that time will tell.You're making excuses'bout the things you never done.You're walking in circles, blinded by the sun.Blinded the sun.I don't mean to sound unkind,to you.You just have to go and findsomething else to do.And don't ask me what went wrongthe list goes on and on and on and on.The list goes on and on and on and on.The list goes on and on.
