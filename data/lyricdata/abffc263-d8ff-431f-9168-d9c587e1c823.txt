I can't see myself too clearly,The clouds are rolling inI can't hear the noise around meBut I know the sound of sinWhere will I be when the world falls down?Head first in the mud bent over withDevils all aroundKill this cravingI can't stop myselfCalling for me in my sleepI hear the sirens flying inCan't turn back I'm in too deepI take another shot of ginKeeping the world from consuming meCan't hold back the demon growlingFrom deep within my seaKill this cravingI can't stop myself Madness, ravingTake me straight to Hell CallingFor me in my sleep-Can't turn backI'm in too deepAs she rides upon my chestPain or joy I love her bestTakes me far into her soul- crawling,Churning, can't let goAs I ride upon her breastTakes me down before I save my soul...
