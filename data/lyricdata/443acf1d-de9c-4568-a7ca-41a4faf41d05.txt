So often I'd stand on my front porchAnd I'd watch the car wrecks all night longIt's Christmas Eve, and I'veHad too much to drinkThe house is quietAnd neatAnd I can't helpBut to thinkOur tires are spinningSoaring through the airI see your face, out of controlSo calm, but you're not scaredThe song on the radio is perfectWe're floating through the airBut you're not scaredSome cars, they drive byWay too fastWhile others, they play it safeAnd I play it safe nowThe tires are spinningSoaring through the airI see your face, out of controlSo calm, but you're not scaredThe song on the radio's perfectYou're floating through the airAnd you're not scared
