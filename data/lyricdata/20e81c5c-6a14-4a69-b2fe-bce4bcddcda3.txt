This morning I made the callThe one that ends it allHanging up, I wanted to cryBut dammit, this well's gone dryNot for the money, not for the fameNot for the power, just no more gamesBut now I'm safe in the eye of the tornadoI can't replace the lies, that let a thousand days goNo more living trapped insideIn her way I'll surely dieIn the eye of the tornado, blow me awayYou'll grow to loathe my nameYou'll hate me just the sameYou won't need your breathAnd soon you'll meet your deathNot from the years, not from the useNot from the tears, just self abuseBut now I'm safe in the eye of the tornadoI can't replace the lies, that let a thousand days goNo more living trapped insideIn her way I'll surely dieIn the eye of the tornado, blow me awayWho's to say, what's for me to say?Who's to say, what's for me to be?Who's to say, what's for me to do?Cause a big nothing it'll be for meThe land of opportunityThe golden chance for meMy future looks so brightNow I think I've seen the lightCan't say what's on my mindCan't do what I really feelIn this bed I made for meIs where I sleep, I really feelI warn you of the fateProven true too lateYour tongue twist perverseCome drink now of this curseAnd now I fill your brainI spin you round againMy poison fills your headAs I tuck you into bedYou feel my fingertipsYou won't forget my lipsYou'll feel my cold breathIt's the kiss of death
