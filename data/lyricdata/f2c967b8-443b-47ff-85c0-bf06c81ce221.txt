They stayed put in their housesOr moved to higher groundsThere are ghosts by the reservoirBut no one wants them round no moreThere’s a spellFor the dam to breakThey’ll tell you all about the time when it cameWhat they took awayIn 1922It caused a droughtIt caused a floodIt came to change us all for goodDo I look like someone?I’ve heard the voices through the floorIn a strange cold languageThey’re planning out a warSo tap into the mainlineAnd tell me all the secretsOf a world you once lived inThat your heart could not swallowThe sky is so shallowIt’s late, you’ve been working hardDrive down to the reservoirIt caused a droughtIt caused a floodIt came to change us all for goodDespite the years they’re still aroundHave we fallen out for good?
