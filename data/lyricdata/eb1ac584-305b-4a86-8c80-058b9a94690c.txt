The muffled beat of music someone celebratesIt's hunting season urbanised I wish I could be thereWarmth and laughter the right amount of dangerJohnnie Walker wisdom as Cohen used to sayBut it's pouring down with rainDo you remember?Are you alive?Do you still speak of deeds undone?I used to be immortal I was innocent as a childMy vision was unlimited I saw rivers on the moonI had important things to say can't remember what they wereOf all the things I did none had been done beforeBut achievements never lastDo you recall?Do you dream?Do you still need company?I had a friend who knew the language of the futureI'm told he lost his mind they say he went awayNavigating empty streets astray among the lostA shadow in the corner of a stranger's eyeBut there's nothing left to learnDo you count the years?Do you breathe?Do you still watch the sunrise?My ambition took me further than I ever dreamtI don't even need a mirror anymoreThe penthouse pool is full of iceIt should be flowers winter came too soonBut you never liked to swimDo you feel safe?Are you happy?Do you still know my name?
