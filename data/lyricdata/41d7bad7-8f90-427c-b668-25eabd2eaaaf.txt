You're so impossibleScream and moan, it chills my soulDon't wanna hear you got left behindAll those times you stayed up and criedIt's no lie, you did it to yourselfLike chewed-up gum under my shelfDon't look surprised, you must have known all alongIt's just another love songAnother love songIt's never easy, it's not hardWhen you've lost your mindWith you, it's sleazyDon't tell me your worriesI'm sick, I'll leave you blindNow the time has comeTo leave this love that's left you dryNo need to work this out now'Cause you know there's no reason whyIt's just another love songAnother love songAnother love songIt's just another love songI never told you it would last foreverYou can't hold this boy for long, dig itBy the time you read my letterBaby, I'll be goneYou're just another love songAnother love songAnother love songYou're just another love songYou're just another love songAnother love songAnother love songYou're just another love song
