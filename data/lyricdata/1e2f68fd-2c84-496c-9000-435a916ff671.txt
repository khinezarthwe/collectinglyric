I've spent all summer days drivingI'm tired of holidays ruinedNo more take-away's, expired foodI need a real dayTime runs faster when you're loadedBright lights blind me all weakLiving in the city, I'm a high-speed drillI need a full day divingTons of heavyweight foodRoosters from the sister islands tooI'd better get workingI'm bored with all that brainwashingLet's break all separate roomsChanging's no fun if you don't want toI need a good day sailingTo tell the sun and the moonThat I am turning for no reasons tooAnd I keep waitingDriving to the gas stationCaught by a traffic jam bluesLife is nonsense, I don't have a clueI need a cool day ridingFeeding all the horses at dawnSearching for the truffles, going through the woodsThen I'll be waitingI've passed all summer days drivingI'm tired of holidays ruinedNo more take-away's, expired foodI need a full day divingTons of heavyweight foodRoosters from the sister islands tooI'd better get working
