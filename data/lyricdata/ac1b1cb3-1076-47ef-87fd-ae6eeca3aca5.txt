It's raining on me, I don't want it to stopI don't want to breathe anymoreI want soggy ground, I want to feel my feet in the sandI want water to rise and cover all the landI want to swim until my arms give out and I come to an endI hope it happens soon, I can't deal with feeling this badI want to be coldAnd I want it to snow so badI hope your flames don't growI want to be buried in snowI hope your flames don't growI just want to be coldAnd I don't want you to know
