You take away the breath I was keeping for sunriseYou appear and the morning looks drab in my eyesAnd then again I'll turn down loveHaving seen you againOnce more you'll disappearMy morning put to shameYou take away the breath I was keeping for sunriseYou appear and the morning looks drab in my eyesAnd then again I'll turn down loveHaving seen you againOnce more you'll disappearMy morning put to shameSometimes I fear that this will go on my life throughEach day I spend in an echoed vision of youAnd then again I'll turn down loveRemembering your smileMy every day is spentThinking of you all the whileThe times I've let myself downMy head's spinning roundMy eyes see only youThe chances I've lostOpportunities tossedAway and into the blueYou take away the breath I was keeping for sunriseYou appear and the morning looks drab in my eyesAnd then again I'll turn down loveHaving seen you againThen again you'll disappearMy morning put to shame
