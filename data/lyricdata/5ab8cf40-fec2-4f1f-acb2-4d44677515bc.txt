There is the need for speedEverything that exceedsThe point of no returnAnd this one's gonna hurtAll set before your eyesA human sacrificeIt's time to clear the rampWho wants to take a chanceSo let's rollAll night longI like the smell of fuelI got myself a bruiseThe only time it's realIt's when I shift the gearsA few in every townThe death defying clownsGather with all their rigsAnd kids are burning wheelsYeah let's rollAll night longAlways pushing it to the X-StreamMetalOne game to entertainThe gain is the painYou might crash in flamesOr jump off the planesThe pavement's made of stonesIn parts with broken bonesBut you ain't out of luckYou live around the clockYeah let's rollAll night longAlways pushing it to the X-StreamMetal1001...1002...1003...OpenAnother world recordAnd this one missed the curveWhat's gonna make me stopWho's gonna take my gutsOne split second and goOne tire had to blowC'mon and give me fiveI died of what I likedSo let's rollAll night longAlways pushing it to the X-StreamMetal1001...1002...1003...Open
