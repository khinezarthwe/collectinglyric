Until Sally I was never happyI needed so much moreRain clouds oh, they used to chase meDown they would pourJoin my tearsAllay my fearsSent to me from heavenSally Cinnamon you're my worldPop, pop, pop, blow, blow bubble gumYou taste of cherryadeThere is something hey you must show meFrom what you are madeSugar and spiceAnd all things niceSent to me from heavenSally Cinnamon you're my worldYou are my worldYour eyes are gazing backFrom every little piece of glassYou seem to smile from every bladeSally Cinnamon you are my worldThen I put the letter backIn the place where it was foundIn the pocket of a jacketOn a train in townSent to her from heavenSally Cinnamon you're her world
