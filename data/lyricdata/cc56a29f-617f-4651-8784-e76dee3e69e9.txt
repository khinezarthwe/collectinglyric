When the dream comes to an end& I wake up once again,It's no surprise anymoreWhen the knock comes on my door.& I go from place to place& always see your face;But you're not there anymoreWhen the knock comes on my door.So I stayed awake all night,Trying to think things right,& I'm down on the floorWhen the knock comes on my door.
