There comes a timeFor everyoneTo sit down and assess what's there and what is not thereEternally up in the airAnd it seems that time has come for youAnd it figues nowI was only the one who needed to appear and cause a turn of eventsTo force a turn of eventsIt's also fitting somehowThat I should be the last to knowAnd I'm blown awayWhen my friend tells me that it's soWhat did I give youThat's harder to answer than what did I takeWhat did I mean to you?
