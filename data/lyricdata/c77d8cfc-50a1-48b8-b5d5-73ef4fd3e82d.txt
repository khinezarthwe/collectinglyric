You're an impossible dreamSo when I go to bedThat's all I'm doing I'm just sleepingCocktails give me ESPI think about youDo you think about meI wonder -- I wanna see you tonightI wanna see, I wanna see,I wanna see you smiling back at me in the starlightShining on the streets downtownI was looking for youLooking for me, againGod I wanna taste your mouthBack you are up against the wall behind the subway stationI wanna see you smileI wanna see, I wanna see, I wanna see you tonightMeet me on the corner -- 44th and BroadwayDid it rain, oh, GodYou could be happy in loveYou can be happy in love with meThat's is you want to for just a little whileNo promises no guarantees tonightMeet me in the hallMeet me in the hallI'll tell the rising sunYou bet'Cause I wanna see you tonightI wanna see, I wanna see, I wanna see you tonightMeet me on the corner -- 44th and BroadwayDid it rain, GodYou could be happy in loveYou could be happy in love with meForever, forever, forever
