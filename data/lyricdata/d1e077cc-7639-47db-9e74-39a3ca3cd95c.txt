Ok time to go on the disco beat that's the way it goesI got a freaky synth and i push up the sin until it pays the rentWhat can u do for me ,i'm in the track like 'woh can u move for meThat's right on the sound get low like woh it's time to touch the groundReal hot motherfucker ,girls check me out like i'm on the x factorAnd it might be it sometimes i pop x just to feel the beatTime to rock the shit ,in the club with the sound i make it hard to sitFrom the deep inside so let it pop right there and enjoy the ride comonTime to feel the station,time to rock the beatI came back shorty yes i'm easy on the track and i keep it funkyThere is no need to talk ,i got my own friends i don't want to stalkComon ,so let's not interupt i got a pretty idea on how you like to fuckDj don'tchange the sound,i like to see u bounceGirl don't stop keep me on the tranceGirl you out of space ,i wanna keep this going like the bass
