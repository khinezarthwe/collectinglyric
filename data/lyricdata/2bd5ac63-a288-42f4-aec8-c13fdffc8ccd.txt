Mothers see it coming aroundThey know they got their heads screwed onI'm standing in the middle of townI know I might never come homeJust standing where I am with all the people passing by meThe sound of all these passers-by mixed in with the bus andmotor-carI must be sure these are the signsCos I've been here a million times beforeJust tell me when it's coming around, coming aroundI think I see you coming to town,Hunting you down Bringing you roundTell me if I'm bringing you downCos I was fine till you came alongYou tell me that the tears of a clownThat I'm confusing while abusing my mindSo far away I wanna beThat's not as close to you and meThe things they call our destinyNow why do you have to pick on me at all?My walls are coming downJust tell me when it's coming around, coming aroundI think I see you coming to town, hunting you downComing aroundJust tell me when it's coming around, coming aroundI think I see you coming to town, dragging you downJust tell me when it's coming around, coming aroundI think I see you coming to town, just dragging you downIt's coming aroundComing around
