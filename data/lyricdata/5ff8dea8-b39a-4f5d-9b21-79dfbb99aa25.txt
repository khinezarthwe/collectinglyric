What went down on the side of the road?What I saw at the edge of the seaOnly those elements time cannot wearAnd they followWhat seeped out through the cracks of time?What sucks out the color in me?What awaits beyond infinity?Beyond and to all time I standBeyond and to all time I standWhat blew in with the great gale?What weighed down the falling leaves?What came forth from the remains?What has always lived and gone unseen?What has caused the night to fall?Who speaks of eternity?Who awakes to night eternally?Beyond and to all time I standBeyond and to all time I standBeyond and to all time I standBeyond and to all time I stand, I stand, I standTo all time I standO my soul love, I pray thee pity meFrom out this dark gulf where this poor heart liesA barren world hemmed in by leaden skiesWhere horror flies at night, and blasphemyFor half the year the sickly sun is seenThe other half thick night lies on the landA country bleaker than the polar strandNo beasts, no brooks, nor any shred of greenThere never was a horror which surpassedThis icy sun's cold crueltyBeyond and to all time I standBeyond and to all time I standBeyond and to all time I standBeyond and to all time I standO my soul love, I pray thee pity meFrom out this dark gulf where my poor heart lies,A barren world hemmed in by leaden skies
