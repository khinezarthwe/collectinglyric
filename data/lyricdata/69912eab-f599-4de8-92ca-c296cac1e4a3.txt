You didn't know where to goWalking around in this flag-waving townI saw you waiting for a trainAnd you disappearedYour face pressed up to the windowYou went so far awayAnd I want to come there tooI want to be with youI'm just waiting until you say these words:"Come back, come back, come back, oh, to meI'm living near Gda≈ÑskThere's a train, you'd be here soonThere's a life for me and youThe East means so many thingsBut it could be home, it could be home, it could be home, it could be homeFor you and meIt could be home, it could be home, it could be home, it could be homeCome back, come back, come back, oh, to me."And if you'd ever say those wordsI'd come to you, where you areIt's too hard to be apartThe East's not so far awayBut it could be home, it could be home, it could be home, it could be homeFor you and meIt could be home, it could be home, it could be home, it could be homeCome back, come back, come backOh, to me
