Lights outBoys sleepwalking on the weekendBlack outTwo nights killing off a best friendFall outLike soldiers walking off the deep endHands outDon't stop marching 'til the hearts rendThe time goes by and sets the stageThey play their parts and act their ageThey never forget the lines that they saySpeaking slowlyI promise you one dayI promise you alwaysWe'll make it out one dayI promise you alwaysNights outGirls keep walking on the east endWhite outTwo lights shining on a dead endDrawn outLike circles trailing off the pavementStand outDon't stop marching 'til the hearts mendThis time goes by, reset the stageWe play the parts and act our ageWe'll never forget the words that they'd sayTalking slowlyI promise you one dayI promise you alwaysWe'll make it out one dayI promise you alwaysI promise you one dayI promise you alwaysWe'll make it out one dayI promise you always
