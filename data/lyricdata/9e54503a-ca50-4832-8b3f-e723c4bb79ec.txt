You are my light in the darkYou are the beating in my heartBut that is not enoughWill I ever be by your sideYour hair is dancing in the windYour eyes are burning off my skinAnd I'm so happy when I seeThat you are smiling back at meYou're leaving burn marks on the groundThank you God for what I've foundI don't know how, I don't know whyBut you're my angel in the nightYou are my light in the darkYou are the beating in my heartLet me hold you nowJust like days before you start to cryYou are my light in the darkYou are the beating in my heartBut that is not enoughWill I ever be by your side(Interlude)I try my best to satisfyBut all you do is wavin' me goodbyeI don't know what I'm gonna doBut I'm so crazy about youEven if I don't know where to startEven if my love is tearing me apartI just know that you and meWe were always meant to beYou are my light in the darkYou are the beating in my heartLet me hold you nowJust like days before you start to cryYou are my light in the darkYou are the beating in my heartBut that is not enoughWill I ever be by your sideYou're my angel in the night
