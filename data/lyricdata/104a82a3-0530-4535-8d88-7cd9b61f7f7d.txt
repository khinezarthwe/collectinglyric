Don't wanna talk about itDon't wanna read about itDon't wanna hear about itDon't wanna see about itSomething's funny about a medical physicianMe lying on my back is his favorite positionDesigner behavior with paxil, and valiumEven you can stomach prozac and lithiumRemember "Ozzie And Harriet"?Remember "The Stepford Wives"?Remember "Father Knows Best"?Remember "I Love Lucy"?A product of designBack to the drawing boardGotta be insane to fit inIf not you'll be ignoredYou take apart my brainBut you couldn't make the pieces fitThen give me happy pillsThere's pieces left you idiot
