Broadway is dark tonightA little bit weaker than you used to beBroadway is dark tonightSee the young man sittin' in the old man's barWaitin' for his turn to dieThe cowboy kills the rock starAnd Friday night's gone too farThe dim light hides the yearsOn all the faded girlsForgotten but not goneYou drink it off your mindYou talk about the worldLike it's someplace that you've beenYou see you'd love to run homeBut you know you ain't got oneCause you're livin' in a world thatYou're best forgotten, around hereBroadway is dark tonightA little bit weaker than you used to beBroadway is dark tonightSee the young man sittin' in the old man's barWaitin' for his turn to dieYou choke down all your angerForget your only sonYou pray to statues when you sober up for funYour anger don't impress meThe world slapped in your faceIt always rains like hell on the loser's day paradeYou see you'd love to run homeBut you know ain't got oneCause you're livin' in a worldThat you're best forgottenWhen you're thinkin' of a jokeAin't nobody gonna listenTo the one small pointI know they've been missin' round hereBroadway is dark tonightA little bit weaker than you used to beBroadway is dark tonightSee the young man sittin' in the old man's barWaitin' for his turn to dieYou see you'd love to run homeBut you know ain't got oneCause you're livin' in a worldThat you're best forgottenWhen you're thinkin' of a jokeAin't nobody gonna listenTo the one small pointI know they've been missin' round hereRound hereBroadway is dark tonightA little bit weaker than you used to beBroadway is dark tonightSee the young man sittin' in the old man's barWaitin' for his turn to die
