Fuck you,You're drunk and acting tough.I know you're sadYou're not the only one who feels like that now.And maybe anger is your only choiceBut maybe heart and fist and human voiceMight be the better wayBe the way.Cause we, we will still need a songTo carry our love away,To carry it away.We will still need a songTo carry our hearts awayTo carry them away.Don't let another tear be in your eyesWe can die in peace knowing we triedTo change our own ways.The poets let a generation downAnd modern music could be a healing soundIt's the only way,Only way.Cause we, we will still need a songTo carry our love away,To carry it away (Last chance for being sad)We will still need a song (I'm tired of feeling bad)To dance on our wedding dayTo carry it away.And we will still need a song (we still need)To carry us on (to carry us on)To carry us onAnd we, we will still need a songTo carry our hearts awayTo carry them away.We will still need a songTo dance on our wedding dayTo carry it away.Last chance for feeling sadI'm tired of being bad (to carry our love away)Last chance for being sadI'm tired of feeling bad.
