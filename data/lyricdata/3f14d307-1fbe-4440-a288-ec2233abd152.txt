I should warn youI go to sleepI know you don'tKnow what i meanYetI get upset or happyI go to sleepNothing hurts whenI go to sleepBut i'm not tiredI'm not tiredI'm not tiredI'm not tiredI know it seems that i don't careBut something in me does i swearI don't remember all last yearI left you awake to cry the tearsWhile i was dreaming in streamsFlowing between the shoresOf joy and sadnessI'm drowningSave meWake me upI should warn youI go to sleepYou won't know whenI go to sleepCause i'm not tiredI'm not tiredI'm not tiredI'm not tiredI'm not tiredI'm not tiredI'm not tiredI'm not tiredI'm not tiredI'm not tiredI'm not tiredI'm not tiredI'm not tiredI'm not tiredI'm not tiredI just sleep
