Oh, man, I can't believe that you did what they said you didAnd to this day I've still gotta say that in my mind I question itI wish I knew what you had meant before you wentAnd left me wondering to just an echo of your voice(Listen...)Now I wait to take my turn to bleedLike a kid playing with a razor bladeAnd wonder if I have the balls at allOr if I'm gonna be afraidWhere are you?  What do you think?'Cause I'm not sure when knocking at death's doorIf I will be welcomed inOr be left alone outsideI hear the sound of a heartFrom the shadow in the darkWaiting for the poison to hit its mark(Listen, my son)I see the darkness surroundThe shape on the groundThe killer straight up and a body face down(Firstborn, last one)I hear the din of the screamsSorrow in streamsThe smell of farewell and gasoline(Listen, my son)I see a heart set freeAnd my legacyHear a voice from a shadow that is beckoning me(Firstborn, last one)I guess there comes a point when you think to yourself"This isn't worth it, it isn't worth it"And now I feel what you feltAnd now I feel what you felt inside, brotherAnd now I feel what you feltThis isn't worth it, it isn't worth itI hear the sound of a heartFrom the shadow in the darkWaiting for the poison to hit its mark(Listen, my son)I see the darkness surroundThe shape on the groundThe killer straight up and a body face down(Firstborn, last one)I hear the din of the screamsSorrow in streamsThe smell of farewell and gasoline(Listen, my son)I see a heart set freeAnd my legacyHear a voice from a shadow that is beckoning me(Firstborn, last one)(Listen)I wish it didn'tI wish it didn'tI wish it didn'tI wish it didn't end this wayI wish it didn'tI wish it didn'tI wish it didn'tI wish it didn't end this wayI wish it didn'tI wish it didn'tI wish it didn'tI wish it didn't end this wayI wish it didn'tI wish it didn'tI wish it didn'tI wish it didn't end this wayI wish it didn'tI wish it didn'tI wish it didn'tI wish it didn't end this wayI wish it didn'tI wish it didn'tI wish it didn'tI wish it didn't end this wayLive a life in hellThrough a mortal shell, asphyxiating smellFor a crime, lifetimeImagination locked in a cellAnd to the other firstbornI see the same scene that must play over in your mindAnd now how much moreI'm sure it's fucked with your head just like it's fucked up mineListenMy sonFirstbornLast oneThe message you sent out to meI cannot change what's meant to beThe message you sent out to meI cannot change what's meant to be(What am I supposed to do now?)I hear the sound of a heartFrom the shadow in the darkWaiting for the poison to hit its markI see the darkness surroundThe shape on the groundThe killer straight up and a body face downI hear the din of the screamsSorrow in streamsThe smell of farewell and gasoline(Listen)I see a heart set freeAnd my legacyHear a voice from a shadow that is beckoning me(My son)I hear the sound of a heartFrom the shadow in the darkWaiting for the poison to hit its mark(Listen, my son)I see the darkness surroundThe shape on the groundThe killer straight up and a body face down(Firstborn, last one)I hear the din of the screamsSorrow in streamsThe smell of farewell and gasoline(Listen, my son)I see a heart set freeAnd my legacyHear a voice from a shadow that is beckoning me(Firstborn, last one)(Firstborn)You are the last one(Firstborn)
