Living and dying, laughing and cryingOnce you have seen it, you will never be the sameLife in the fast lane is just how it seemsHard and it is heavy and dirty and meanMotorbreath, it's how I live my lifeI can't take it any other wayMotorbreath, the sign of living fastIt is going to take your breath awayDon't stop for nothing, it's full speed or nothingI am taking down you know, whatever is in my wayGetting your kicks as you are shooting the lineSending the shivers up and down my spineMotorbreath, it's how I live my lifeI can't take it any other wayMotorbreath, the sign of living fastIt is going to take your breath awayThose people who tell you not to take chancesThey are all missing on what life is aboutYou only live once, so take hold of the chanceDon't end up like others, the same song and danceMotorbreath, it's how I live my lifeI can't take it any other wayMotorbreath, the sign of living fastIt is going to take your breath away
