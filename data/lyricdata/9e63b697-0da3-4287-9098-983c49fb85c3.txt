Valerie's dancing, in the room above my bed you knowFor all of the world below to seeValerie's leaving, in a car outside my house you knowIts such a shame she's not with me and all the pretty thingsAnd all the love my heart would bringI would give my whole life to herValerie loves meValerie's riding, in a car around my neighborhoodShe's thinking of all the men she'll meetI could only hope for a stolen moment of her thoughtsBetween the walk to the club and all the drinks she'll haveIn a crowded room where everybody leaves too soonI only hope that she remembers meValerie loves meValerie loves meValerie's lonely, in an apartment down the street you knowAnd her hair has turned so greyBut she's so happy, for the memories she has you knowShe can believe in the day when love was on a stringAnd she could have that anything she ever wantedBut she cant have meValerie loves me
