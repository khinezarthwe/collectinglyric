I only know her first nameI only know her by her fameIt seems to hide in my brainRun away with a broken momentHide away and wait for me in my dreamsDreams of me and my girlCarrie comes with a copied promiseStay awake all night and she can be freeTo tell me everything is trueSunshine comes and steals my night timeFlowers wave and the try and liberate meHiding away from her dreamsBa ba da ba ba ba ba (x4)Stay awake and hide from CarrieShe comes along and she sings to me in my dreamsHaunting me in my viewCrash again into her morningI'm all alone in the restlessness of her painFree from all of her styleJuxtaposed with the light of sunshineI hide away from her political viewFlowers that liberate meGo to sleep and await the night timeHiding from the light that she brings with herPolicies of the worstI only know her first nameI only know her by her fameIt seems to hide in my brainGet up early to sit and sip wineFlowers say that everything will be fineJust like all the old times
