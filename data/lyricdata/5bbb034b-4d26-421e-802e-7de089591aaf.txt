Of late, it's harder just to go outsideTo leave this dead space, with hatred so aliveWrithing with sicknessThrown into banalityI decay, killed by the weaknessBut forced to returnTurn it offI watch the stars as they fall from the skyI held a fallen star and it wept for me, dyingI feel the fallen stars encircle meNow as they cryOut there, so quickly, grows malignant tribesPost-human extinction excels unrecognizedFeeling surroundedSo bored with mortalityI decay, all of this hatredIs fucking realTurn it onI watch the stars as they fall from the skyI held a fallen star and it wept for me, dyingI feel the fallen stars encircle meNow as they cryIt won't be all rightDespite what they sayJust watch the stars tonight as theyAs they disappear, disintegrateAnd I disintegrateCause this hate is fucking realAnd I hope to shade the worldAs stars go out and I disintegrateIt won't be all rightDespite what they sayJust watch the skyAs stars go out
