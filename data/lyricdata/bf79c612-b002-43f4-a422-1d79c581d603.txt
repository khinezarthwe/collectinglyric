I'm seein' redDon't think you'll have to see my face againDon't have much time for sympathy'cause it never happened to meYou feelin' blue nowI think you bit off more than you could chewAnd now it's time to make a choiceAnd all I want to hear is yourSo follow the leader downAnd swallow your pride and drownWhen there's no place left to goMaybe that's when you will knowFollow the leader downAnd swallow your pride and drownWhen there's no place left to goMaybe that's when you will knowAnd foolish lies well can't you seeI tried to compromise'cause what you say ain't always trueAnd I can see the tears in your eyesAnd what you said nowCan't stop the words from running through my headAnd what I do to get through to youBut you'd only do it againSo follow the leader downAnd swallow your pride and drownWhen there's no place left to goMaybe that's when you will knowFollow the leader downAnd swallow your pride and drownWhen there's no place left to goMaybe that's when you will knowWell I confess, I don't know what to make from all this messDon't have much time for sympathyBut it never happened to meYou Feelin down I don't know where I'll be when you come aroundAnd now it's time to make a choiceAnd all I want to hear is your voice
