Surly girl, you got all the glamour in the worldBut you make my toes and fingers curlThe way you smile, as though it's going out of styleYou're a funny one, should be having lots of funBut you're dwelling on the things you've doneThere in the past, believe me girl, it doesn't lastArtists and philosophers tried to run away with herFor their love, she couldn't careShe's waiting for a millionaireI watch you dear, count the Gypsies, spin the wheelBut tell me that you never feel a little sadTo think of what you could have hadArtists and philosophers tried to fire into herThis girl is tearing out her hairWaiting for a millionaireI understand, you've found yourself a wealthy manHe got you eating from his handAnd now you know exactly where the money goesBut they brought you in, made you tell a tale on himThere was no way that you could winIt's just a question of when, gonna see your face in the papers againArtists and philosophers tried to win the heart of herThey're up here, but she's down thereWaiting for a millionaire
