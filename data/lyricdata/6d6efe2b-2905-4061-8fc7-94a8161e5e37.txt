Like a siren in my head that always threatens to repeatLike a blind man that is strapped into the speeding driverâ€™s seatLike a face that learns to speakWhen all it knew was how to biteLike a misery that keeps me focused through I've gone astrayLike an endless nightmare that I must awaken from each dayLike conviction... A premonitionNot worthy of, so I deny... I denyI blind my eyes and try and force it all into placeI stitch them up, see not my fall from graceI blind my eyes, I hide and feel it passing me byI open just in time to say goodbyeAlmost like your lifeAlmost like your endless fightCurse the day is longRealize you don't belongDisconnect somehowNever stop the bleeding nowAlmost like your fightAnd there it went,Almost like your lifeLike a wound that keeps on bleeding to remind me not to thinkLike a raging river, drowning, when I only need a drinkLike a poison that I swallowBut I want the world to dieLike a release from prison that I didn't know I was inLike a fight to live the past,I prayed to leave, from way back thenLike a General without a mission,Until the war will start again... Start againI blind my eyes and try and force it all into placeI stitch them up, see not my fall from graceI blind my eyes, I hide and feel it passing me byI open just in time to say goodbyeAlmost like your lifeAlmost like your endless fightCurse the day is longRealize you don't belongDisconnect somehowNever stop the bleeding nowAlmost like your fightAnd there it wentAlmost like your lifeLike a touch from Hell to feel howhot that it can get if you get caughtLike a strike from Heaven, turns that key,And brings you straight down to your kneesLike a touch from Hell to feel howhot that it can get if I get caughtLike a strike from Heaven, to reprieve,That brings you straight down to your kneesAlmost like your lifeAlmost like your endless fightCurse the day is longRealize you don't belongDisconnect somehowNever stop the bleeding nowAlmost like your fightAnd there it wentAlmost like your lifeThat was just your life
