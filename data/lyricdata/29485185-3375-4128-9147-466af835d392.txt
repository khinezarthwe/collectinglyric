The fade proof lines that define status and meaningAre illegible too thin to readI've lost radiance under petals and softer wordsThe vine bleeds divine screamsDo your wings make a sound?Sometimes i swear i can hear themYou left poison mercury dreamsWill you reveal what it meansTaste the potency of your deadened knowledgeThe decline through sifting perilsForces you under stretch past the shattered arrowsThe vine bleeds divine screamsDo your wings make a sound?Sometimes i swear i can feel themThe florescent lightingDoes nothing to keep you from hidingI can hear themI can feel them
