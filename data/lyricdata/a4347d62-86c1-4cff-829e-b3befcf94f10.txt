If you could read my mindThan I know you'd find everything you never sayYou said you needed timeSo I asked if you would mindIf I could do the sameSenses over blownYou're never comingYou're goingAnd it's driving me crazyKnowing what's good for youAnd I'm longing for the lazy daysBut those were never good enoughI guess that you were rightWhen you said I mightReally get bored with youI never would have guessedThat it'd end in such a messOr that it'd be this soonCause there's something about youBut I can't put my finger on itSo hard to forget youYou're my favourite worst enemyWhen you sat there laughing all about itDid it make you feel any better about itCan you try to hide it well enoughTo fake it just for meI doubt it
