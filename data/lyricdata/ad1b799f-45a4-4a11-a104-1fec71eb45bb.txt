True enoughI hear them take you awayBut you could be home in a dayAnd let the hammer fallI'm aloneBecause my friends have places to goMy people have people to knowThey've never seemed so remoteI'm taking it easy if it comes to fateBut for the time, I've gotta waitSoothe your bonesWith the papers of a man that you knowHis kids are really gonna growAnd leave their daddy homeBut it's an easy gameThose clouds bring heavy, heavy rainAnd lifting is an awful lot of painWe're gonna be sore for sureI'm takin it easy if it comes to fateBut for the time, I've gotta waitI'm takin it easy if it comes to fateBut for the time, I've gotta wait
