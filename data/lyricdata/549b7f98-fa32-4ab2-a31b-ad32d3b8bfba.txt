Wait right here, don't make a move.We gotta find the man with the golden tooth.He knows me, hell he gave me my name,He's got instructions for us plus our fare for the train,And you know that things could get scary.Come on let's go there's not a second to lose.We've gotta find a man in the red leather shoes,You know that he knows more that he lets on,So we;ll tell him we're strapped with an atomic bombAnd that's when the truth will flow like milk and honey.The screen goes dark and pumping hearts are the only sounds we can hear,The program runs and the sound of guns, I think the coast is finally clear.I don't know how, I don't even know why,But there are certain things that must be done rightTo return to the light.There's a demon in the room and he like to hide,I punch in my code by access deniedAnd then you say that you got a plan,You tell me what to do and where I should standAnd that's when all hell breaks loose.It's like super speed how your mind reacts.I've never seen such a clever attack.And now we can continue on, we're almost there,Yeah it won't be too long 'till we find outWhat we will become.The screen goes dark and pumping hearts are the only sounds we can hear,The program runs and the sound of guns, I think the coast is finally clear.I don't know how, I don't even know why,But there are certain things that must be done rightTo return to the light.Filtering the darkness until the whole thing shines.We've finally come to where we belong.I think I'm going to lose control.I've see some strange things,And I've done some strange things too,But don't second-guess, this is the best,I think I'm going to lose control.Look how we start to glow.Bitter before, but better now,It feels so good to float back down to the ground,Can't you see, what's that sound,Oh it sounds so sweet, sweet in my ear.Wait right here, don't make a move,We gotta place a call to deliver the news that it's safe now.We can all rest our heads, then we'll go homeAnd we'll both go to bed for a while, both wearing smiles.My partner and me, we have been through such things,But this feeling inside is so hard to describe,Oh what completion can bring.There are certain things that must be done right to return to the light
