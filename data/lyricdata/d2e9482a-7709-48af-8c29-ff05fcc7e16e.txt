When the room is quietThe daylight almost goneIt seems there's something I should knowWell I ought to leave butThe rain it never stopsAnd I have no particular place to goJust when I think I'm winningWhen I've broken every doorThe ghosts of my lifeBlow wilder than beforeJust when I thought I could not be stoppedWhen my chance came to be kingThe ghosts of my lifeBlew wilder than the windWell I'm feeling nervousAnd I find myself aloneThe simple life's no longer thereOnce I was so sureNow the doubt inside my mindComes and goes but leads nowhereJust when I think I'm winningWhen I've broken every doorThe ghosts of my lifeBlow wilder than beforeJust when I thought I could not be stoppedWhen my chance came to be kingThe ghosts of my lifeBlew wilder than the wind
