The tides of change pulled us apartI feel a familiar painIt seems like years since we've lovedOr even liked and that's a lonely way to beDrifting alone in a sea of agonyYour face I can't recognizeDon't make this hard on usI will miss you if you just go awayI did no right you did no wrongNothing left but wasted daysI regret you leavingBut I will never take you backYou know what? It's overI just don't feel the same way as I used toWe've been together forever, but it's overGoodbye 1000 times goodbyeThe thought never crossed my mindThat this would be my last goodbyeLet me put pennies on your eyesAnd kiss your lips one last goodbyeMy love 1000 times goodbyeIt seems nothing good is freeA good thing cost much more than the priceYou were good but not that goodDon't kid yourself now it's time to break upDrifting alone in a sea of agonyYour face I can't recognizeDon't make this hard on usI will miss you if you just go awayI did no right you did no wrongNothing left but wasted daysI regret you leavingBut I'll never take you backDon't call me anymore. It's just not'I don't feel the same way about youIts not as good as it used to beGoodbye 1000 times goodbyeThe thought never crossed my mindThat this would be my last goodbyeLet me put pennies on your eyesAnd kiss your lips one last goodbyeMy love 1000 times goodbyeI'll always love you but just not like thatLike what?I want to be honest with you I met someone elseYou did what?And I really, I really love him like I used to love youRemember the time that I told you thatI was going out of town for business?Well I went to see himYou know what? You suck!Goodbye 1000 timesYou'll always have a special placeIn my heart you know thatIt's just I can't be with you anymore it's overGoodbye 1000 timesThings may not work out with himGoodbye 1000 timesAnd if they don'tGoodbye 1000 timesThen I'll certainly call youGoodbye 1000 timesYou mean a lot to meI still really want to be friends with youI love you like you're my brother
