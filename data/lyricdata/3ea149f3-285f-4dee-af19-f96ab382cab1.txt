For once I missed a pleaI have said too much in memoryI don't know whyI'm forever learningWhy be so decievingWhen it's all to no availI could take you serious againEven though you find it all so devious, againI know you willI've tried to warn youI've tried to tell youBut it's all to no availYou've got me all of a trembleIf it takes a thousand yearsThen I must try to catch herI could make those promises againEven though I crucify your attitude againIf I should fail...If it takes a thousand yearsThen I must tryIf it takes a million yearsThen I must tryTo catch her, catch her, catch her...
