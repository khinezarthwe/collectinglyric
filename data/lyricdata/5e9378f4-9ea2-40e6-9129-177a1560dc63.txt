Underneath the sky of redThere's a storyteller sleepin' aloneHe has no face and he has no nameAnd his whereabouts are sort of unknownAll he needs is his life in a suitcaseIt belongs to a friend of a friendAnd as we drink to ourselvesWe'll amuse ourselvesUnderneath the sky, underneath the sky againUnderneath the sky againSo wish me away to an unknown placeAm I livin' in a land with no nameI'll be making a start with my brand new heartStop me makin' sense once againAll we need is our lives in a suitcaseThey belong to a friend of a friendAnd as we drink to ourselvesWe'll amuse ourselvesUnderneath the sky, underneath the sky againUnderneath the sky againAll we need is our lives in a suitcaseThey belong to a friend of a friendAnd as we drink to ourselvesWe'll amuse ourselvesUnderneath the sky, underneath the sky againUnderneath the sky againUnderneath the sky againUnderneath the sky againUnderneath the sky againAgain, againUnderneath the sky again
