Who could send something so pure to lure me awayI fought with the last of my breathBut you came along on a glorious dayBy the time that you left I was crawling againYeah, you came along on a glorious dayNow I want you to save me againThe fire that they said would burn just lights up the wayI lie in the place where I fellAnd three years on, the nine day wonder won't go awayTill you bring an end to my hellAnd you came along on a glorious dayBy the time that you left I was crawling againYeah, you came along on a glorious dayNow I want you to save me againLet them all keep their plans'Cause all I want, is in my handsAnd I can't look downBack then I had it allAnd now I wont get it back that's allAnd I can't get outYou came along, on a glorious dayBy the time that you left i was crawling againYeah, you came along on a glorious dayNow I want you to save me againNow I want you to save me againNow I want you to save me again
