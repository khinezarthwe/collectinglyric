I feel a heavy burdenA million souls upon me weighThough I've felt uncertainThe more revealed, I've found my wayAm I a gift, am I a curse?I'm one and all of God and EarthAnd as the order guides meThe trials beckon brutal daysThe Art of the TravelersThe Ghost Dance and the Shifter's WayAm I a gift, am I a curse?I'm one and all of God and EarthAt times there's doubt within meTo ask as much of one so youngYet I believe in the prophecyAnd the framing that's been done(bridge)And I know I possess the strengthThey've molded me from birthThe catalyst of all that's plannedCleansing man from EarthInject the venom into my veinsOf the vile beasts of EarthThe transformation now takes placeThe Shifter's art is learnedThe Dimension Gauntlet lies aheadI master every ageI am a God that walks the EarthThe embodiment of rageNow the trials are overI am complete, what I was born to beThe crown awaits the chosenAnd I begin my destinyI am a gift, I am a curseOne and all a God on Earth
