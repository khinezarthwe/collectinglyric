We were seven and ten when I first wondered whenOur hearts would give us awayThe die had been cast and faces gone pastWho pray that chance comes againAnd we raged in the streets to the sound of defeatAs our debts grew larger each dayBut in place of regret were the good times we spentIn beds where once we layAnd I had to ask I just had to askWhere it all slips awayAnd I had to ask I just had to askWhere it all slips awayAnd you held onto me saying tenderlyYou'll go on, just go onAnd you held onto me saying tenderlyYou'll go on, just go on, and on, and onIt was a time to rememberWe ran from foreverA time to rememberWe'll never forget itWe were youngWe were singingOur lives were beginningWe covered up the cracks for a whileAs we fell for the breeze of the underground sleazeWe ran and danced togetherAnd the boys in the bar might not get all that farBut they never had it betterAnd I had to ask It was a time to remember.And maybe one dayWe'll think about what got awayAnd maybe one dayWe'll think of faces and the namesIt's all the sameWe drink alone in penniless laneThrough the tears and the lies and the lost cold lonely nightsA time to remember.
