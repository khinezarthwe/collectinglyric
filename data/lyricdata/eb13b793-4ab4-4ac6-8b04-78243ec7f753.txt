Oh, i thought i saw you right where we were walkingBack in my evil daysOh, my god, you're talking right where we were walkingBack in my evil daysGo look through the window if you're wondering why i've been lowI don't miss my evil daysBut when i see you walking, i can hear us talkingBack in the evil daysWhat you say doesn't mean a thing to me anymoreWhat you do doesn't mean a thing to me anymoreThe color of your hair, it almost gets you thereBut it's too coarse to call it fineSo you cut it off and gave it to your boyfriendThen you had to borrow mineLet's take to the sirens with a tire ironSilence the offending choirBut when i hear you talking, i'm so glad i'm walkingInto a quiet fireWhat you say doesn't mean a thing to me anymoreWhat you do doesn't mean a thing to me anymoreYou need your needs to get along
