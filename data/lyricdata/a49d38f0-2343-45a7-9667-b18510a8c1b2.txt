This little town hasn't changed so much, not since the time of nightWhen we would lie out and talk like we couldn't be touchedThen you'd go away when the morning was lightBut sure enough well we had to grow upAnd there's nothing like a full time job to put out your fireWe were young and wasn't in love but maybe we were happyGetting carried awayNow that seems so long ago, out the door and down the roadI'm sometimes sick when I'm alone of the times we had and now we don'tBut out in the past we were running around thatSometimes so fast with your foot on the groundIt was so hard to stand you never could tellThat all I saw was youAnd every place that we talk about don't seem so far awayWhen you rely on yourself and the one you're aroundAnd always believe everything that they sayBut little talk isn't always enough and just cause you'reStill here now doesn't mean you're a liarWe were young and that was enoughAnd life has a habit of getting in the way
