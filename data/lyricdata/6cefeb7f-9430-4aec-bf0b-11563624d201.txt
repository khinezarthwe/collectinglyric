I don't know whose side I'm onI don't think that I belong 'round hereIf I left the stage would that be wrong?I tried to find myself a better wayI got religion but I went astrayThey took my money and I lost my faithRain keeps crawling down the glassThe good times never seem to lastClose your eyes and let the thought passI tried the capsule and I tried the smokeI tried to aid escape like normal folkBut I never seemed to get the jokeRain keeps crawling down the glassThe good times never seem to lastClose your eyes and let the thought pass(Close your eyes and let it pass)These are my old clothesThis is a new lowThis is my blood flowThis is my headstoneI spend the days with all my friendsThey're the ones on whom my life dependsI'm gonna miss them when the series endsRain keeps crawling down the glass(Pull yourself together)The good times never seem to last(You know it's not so bad)Close your eyes and let the thought pass(Close your eyes and let it pass)
