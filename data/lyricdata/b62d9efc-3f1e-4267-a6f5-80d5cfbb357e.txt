At my house I've got no shacklesYou can come and look if you want toIn the halls you'll see the mantlesWhere the light shines dim all around youAnd the streets are paved with goldAnd if someone asks you, you can call my nameYou are just a thought that someoneSomewhere somehow feels you should be hereAnd it's so for real to touchTo smell, to feel, to know where you are hereAnd the streets are paved with goldAnd if someone asks you, you can call my nameYou can call my nameI hear you calling my name yeah, alright now, heyBy the time that I'm through singingThe bells from the schools of wars will be ringingMore confusions, blood transfusionsThe news today will be the movies for tomorrowAnd the water's turned to bloodAnd if you don't think soGo turn on your tubAnd it it's mixed with mudYou'll see it turn to grayAnd you can call my nameI hear you callin' my name
