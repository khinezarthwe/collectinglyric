The wind caught the seagull and chased it off the shoreSee how it tremblesGivin' in, drifting offA boy lit a cigaretteWhile the girl closed the doorThese hopeless romantic foolsWon’t be lovers no moreBut see how the waves are rushing inAnd see how the waves are washing offLeaving the shore so pureCleansing until it’s white as snowA dear's gasping for airIt’s made its last mistakeA fool for old nature’s rulesDrifts away in the wake of the dawnA car leaves the front yardOf a house she calls homeHer man won’t be back againWon’t be home anymoreBut see how the waves are rushing inAnd see how the waves are washing offLeaving the shore so pureCleansing until it’s white as snowNew day’s dawn as the dark drifts away
