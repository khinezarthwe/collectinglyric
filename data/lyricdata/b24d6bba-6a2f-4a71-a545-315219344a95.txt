[Music: James Gulotta, Tim Kelly, Chris Lykins, Rick Skowron][Lyrics: Brian Zimmerman][Solo: Rick]Destruction is my goalCare for no one at allDeath callsI've killed beforeAnd you won't be my lastThat's for sureLife of pain and I'm to blameBroken familiesShattered dreamsAll because of meCan't you seeBlinded by the whiteYou can't see the lightNot tonightLife of pain and I'm to blameAnd nowI've got you hookedTake another lookAt yourselfLost your home and prideYou can't win the fightYou're not too brightLife of pain and I'm to blameAnd you put to shame[Chorus:]Running scared no where to turnI've got you now your going to burnYou've watched your life pass you byThe life you lead is one big lie[Solo: Chris][Repeat verse]
