In my eyesIndisposedIn disguise as no one knowsHides the faceLies the snakeAnd the sun in my disgraceBoiling heatSummer stench'Neath the black, the sky looks deadCall my nameThrough the creamAnd I'll hear you scream againBlack hole sunWon't you comeAnd wash away the rain?Black hole sunWon't you come?Won't you come?Won't you come?StutteringCold and dampSteal the warm wind, tired friendTimes are goneFor honest menAnd sometimes, far too long for snakesIn my shoesA walking sleepAnd my youth, I pray to keepHeaven sendHell awayNo one sings like you anymoreBlack hole sunWon't you comeAnd wash away the rain?Black hole sunWon't you come?Won't you come?Black hole sunWon't you comeAnd wash away the rain?Black hole sunWon't you come?Won't you come?Won't you come?Won't you come?Won't you come?Hang my headDrown my fearTill you all just disappearBlack hole sunWon't you comeAnd wash away the rain?Black hole sunWon't you come?Won't you come?Black hole sunWon't you comeAnd wash away the rain?Black hole sunWon't you come?Won't you come?Won't you come?Won't you come?Won't you come?Won't you come?Won't you come?Won't you come?Won't you come?
