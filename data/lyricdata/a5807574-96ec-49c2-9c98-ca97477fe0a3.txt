I'm going totally round the bendI don't want to see my friendsI don't want to see my mad friendBecause he's driving me insaneI don't want to see my friendsI'm going totally round the bendEarlier on today I tried to walk down the streetBut my feet kept *slipping* on the pavementI find myself at 90 degrees to the rest of the worldIt's not much fun you can take it from meI'm not having too good a timeThere's people worse off than me,Don't think I don't realise that,But I'm going round the bend againThe last thing I wanna do is see my friends againI'm going quitely round the bend againI try to function as a normal human beingI washed my car earlier on this eveningAnd now I'm trying to get it together to cook a little mealBefore I go for a drink with my friendsBut I've got no food, I've got no time to go to the supermarket**It's not that I couldn't make timeIt's more I get confused when I get therePeople walking past see the green *trees* outsideThey see a nice little flat and imagine the person insideIs having a great old timeWell I wish I was having a *good* a time asThey possibly imagine that I'm havingAll I wanna do is go far awayAnd see things I've never seen beforeLike the PyramidsThey weren't built in a day you knowThose 4th dynasty pyramidsJust don't fit into the equationBut I'm so paranoidI can't even make it to the supermarketLet alone go to EgyptTo see my favourite pyramidNow I'm going to go round to Robin'sAnd try to eat some food there**Sometimes it eats better if you're in the company of menHe's just said he's had a glass of red wineSo I might have mineI listened to the Beach Boys just a minute ago'Wild Honey' it's not their best albumbut it's still pretty goodThey've got some funny little love songs on thereBut its not mainly a Brian Wilson productionSo it's probably not as good as something like 'Pet Sounds'I'm going totally round the bendI don't wanna see my friends againI just want to be left aloneAnd never bothered ever againNever again, never again, never againever again, ever again
