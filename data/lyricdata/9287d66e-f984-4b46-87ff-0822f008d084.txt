When I was in grade sixI used to hold open the door for a girlAnd she called me a wimpShe said there just isn't need to be so fucking politeI politely agreed with her I think she was rightIt just never entered my mindThat at 12 it all came down to chosing sidesYou said that I'd die if I had nothing to doPut a drink in my hand and I'll talk to anything that movesI just refuse to give you what you think will make things rightJustifying hate when you've lost the will to fightWould it be really in touch with the timesTo put somebody down for choosing sidesAnd she said, show us them teethGive us them bracesShow us that dental workThat puts fear in 12 year old facesI could make you feelEven half worthwhileJust please don't ask me to smileAnd at times when it still feels rightI still hold open the door for a girl and I'll back down from a fightAnd if there just isn't need to be so politeAt least it helps me sleep easier at nightIt just never entered my mindThat it ever should come down to choosing sidesAnd she said, show us them teethGive us them bracesShow us that dental workThat puts fear in 12 year old facesI could prove to youThat I do or don't get highJust please don't ask me to smile
