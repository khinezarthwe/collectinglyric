I tell you how I feel, but you don't careI say tell me the truth, but you don't dareYou say love is a hell you cannot bearAnd I say gimme mine back and then go there, for all I careI got my feet on the groundAnd I don't go to sleep to dreamYou got your head in the cloudsYou're not at all what you seemThis mind, this body, and this voice cannot be stifledBy your deviant waysSo don't forget what I told you,Don't come around, I got my own hell to raiseI have never been so insulted in all my lifeI could swallow the seas to wash down all this prideFirst you run like a fool just to be at my sideAnd now you run like a fool, but you just run to hideAnd I can't abideI got my feet on the groundAnd I don't go to sleep to dreamYou got your head in the cloudsYou're not at all what you seemThis mind, this body, and this voice cannot be stifledBy your deviant waysSo don't forget what I told you,Don't come around, I got my own hell to raiseDon't make it a big deal, don't be so sensitiveWe're not playing a game anymoreYou don't have to be so defensiveDon't you plead me your case, don't bother to explainDon't even show me your face, cause it's a crying shameJust go back to the rock from under which you cameTake the sorrow you gave and all the stakes you claimAnd don't forget the blameI got my feet on the groundAnd I don't go to sleep to dreamYou got your head in the cloudsAnd you're not at all what you seemThis mind, this body, and this voice cannot be stifledBy your deviant waysSo don't forget what I told you,Don't come around, I got my own hell to raiseI got my feet on the groundAnd I don't go to sleep to dreamYou got your head in the cloudsAnd you're not at all what you seemThis mind, this body, and this voice cannot be stifledBy your deviant waysSo don't forget what I told you,Don't come around, I got my own hell to raise
