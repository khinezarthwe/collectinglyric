Meadowlark, fly your way downI hold a cornucopia and a golden crownFor you to wear upon your fleecy downMy meadowlark, sing to meHummingbird, just let me diveInside the broken ovals of your olive eyesI do believe you gave it your best tryMy hummingbird, sing to meMy hummingbird, sing to meDon't believe a word that I haven't heardLittle children laughing at the boys and girlsThe meadowlark singing to you each and every dayThe arc light on the hillside and the market in the hay
