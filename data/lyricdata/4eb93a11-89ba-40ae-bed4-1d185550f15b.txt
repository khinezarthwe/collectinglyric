A moth into a butterfly and a lie into the sweetest truthI'm so afraid of lifeI try to call your name, butI'm silenced by the fear of dying in your heart once againI see the seasons changingAnd in the heart of this autumn, I fallWith the leaves from the treesI play deadTo hide my heartUntil the world, gone dark, fades awayI cry like God cries the rain andI'm just one step away from the end of todayI see the reasons changingAnd in the warmth of the past, I crawlScorched by the shameI play deadTo hide my heartUntil the world, gone dark, fades awayI stay deadUntil you veil my scars and say goodbye to fateBefore it's too late
