Look away from the seaI can take you anywhereSpend a vision with meA chase with the windMove closer to meI can make you anyoneI think you're ready to seeThe Gates of BabylonThe power of what has been beforeRises to trap you withinA magic carpet ride a genie maybe moreA city of heavenly sinSleep with the devil and then you must paySleep with the devil, the devil will take you awayOh Gates of BabylonYou can see but you're blindSomeone turned the sun aroundBut you can see in your mindThe Gates of BabylonYou're riding the endless caravanBonded and sold as a slaveA sabre dance removing all the veilsGetting as good as you gaveSleep with the devil and then you must paySleep with the devil, the devil will take you awayLook away from the seaI can take you anywhereSpend a vision with meA chase with the windMove closer to meI can make you anyoneI think you're ready to seeThe Gates of BabylonThe power of what has been beforeRises to trap you withinA magic carpet ride, a genie, maybe moreA city of heavenly sinSleep with the devil and then you must paySleep with the devil, the devil will take you awayBlack Gates of BabylonThe devil is meAnd I'm holding the keyTo the gates of sweet hellBabylon
