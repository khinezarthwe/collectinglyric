Free from the torment of sinAll of this I'm giving up much asThe sun would decide to give inExplode into orangeAnd hearing voices sing phrasesWith hymns, Mark the birth of a changeFree from the torment of sinAll of this I'm giving upIt's not meBury wreckage my soulIt's not meSo who am I now?Over and over againLight with the sharpened edgeCut to the backEmpty space we call skyForgetting the cycle that staysAnd I know in my heart we all dieLike the day and nightLike the sun in the skyAll of this I'm giving upIt's not meBury wreckage my soulIt's not meSo who am I now?It's not meBury wreckage my soulIt's not meSo who am I now? (Who am I now?)Is there another sideBeyond the black and whitePlace I could meet you byPlace on the other sideI'll let you know when I goI'll let you know when I goWhen I goIt's not meBury wreckage my soulIt's not meSo who am I now?It's not meBury wreckage my soulIt's not meSo who am I now?Its not me (on the other side)Bury wreckage my soul (wreckage my)It's not meSo who am I now (who am I now)
