Are teenage dreams so hard to beatEvery time she walks down the streetAnother girl in the neighbourhoodWish she was mine, she looks so goodI wanna hold her, wanna hold her tightGet teenage kicks right through the nightI'm gonna call her on the telephoneHave her over cos I'm all aloneI need excitement, oh I need it badAnd its the best I've ever hadI wanna hold her, wanna hold her tightGet teenage kicks right through the nightI wanna hold her, wanna hold her tightGet teenage kicks right through the night
