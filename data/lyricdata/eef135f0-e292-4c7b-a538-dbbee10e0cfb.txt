Enslave my heart, revealed is her apathey.I'm bounded by a fear of loneliness,Show me fidelity now fill me with a false sense of hope,This will be reminder of what we once were.I'll leave your lips soaked with remnants of a love held together by deception.And death is masked as my savior.Martyred in you heartless name.The detriment was much too profound for youTo mend my wounds sweetly with your blackened kiss,My heart you've bled it dry.You could mean the world to me nothing less throughout eternity.You're the end of the world to me.A beautiful contradiction possessing me.I can give you no more than all the love I have.Take it with you wherever your heart shall lead you.This is the requiem for broke hearts and empty promises,With weary steps I will press on no longer,Now watch as the blade cuts through my skin,And this blood will forever rain up on your guiltless head,Could you hold this close to your heart forever...forever?Will you hold this close to your heart forever and always.Or will you bathe in my blood foerver and always?
