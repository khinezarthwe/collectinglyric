We don't talkLike we used toThe perfect presentIs no longer the futureAnd I can't find itTrust me, I looked aroundSeems like all the sandIs in the bottom nowWe gotta knowKnow when to fightKnow when to holdAnd when to let it goI hope we survive'Cause it’s passing byI won't be surprisedIf it all up and blowsIf it all up and blowsI wish we could rewindI wish we could rewindWe are the shoreThe wave is risingWe are the dustMade out of diamondsWhere metal rustsWe all are drowningIsland of manWe are surroundedWe gotta knowKnow when to fightKnow when to holdAnd when to let it goI hope we survive'Cause it’s passing byI won't be surprisedIf it all up and blowsIf it all up and blowsI wish we could rewindI wish we could rewindMake a little loveMake a little warTell me how it feelsDreaming without a futureHave a little laughHave a little cryEach moment gets us closerTo saying goodbyeMake a little loveMake a little warTell me how it feelsDreaming without a futureHave a little laughHave a little cryEach moment gets us closerTo saying goodbyeThe big hand keeps getting closerTo the little handAll good things come to an endAnd turn around againThe big hand keeps getting closerTo the little handAll good things come to an endAnd turn around againWe gotta knowKnow when to fightKnow when to holdAnd when to let it goI hope we survive'Cause it’s passing byI won't be surprisedIf it all up and blowsIf it all up and blowsI wish we could rewindIf it all up and blowsI wish we could rewindIf it all up and blowsIf it all up and blowsI wish we could rewindI wish we could rewind
