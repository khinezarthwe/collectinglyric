"Angels Holocaust"As I walk through the blackened forestThoughts of hate and anger fill my soulThe charred remains of the holy rollersScream repentance though it's far too lateI fight back the laughter at what I seeThe suffering healers false destined prophecyHe didn't think yesterday of the end of his lifeThe brainwashed fools born again of a thousand liesHate filled screams break the silenceTerrifying dreams filling up your headBlasphemy thrusting out, in the masses it reignsThe mask of hypocrisy is slowly unveiledFear the angels holocaust, they're screamingDreams of pain forever entering your headDeath and hatred loathing, on mankind it feedsEarth is dead and gone now, we've brought it to an endFor the last time I've been betrayedNever again will I subject myself to this hypocrisySomething is drawing me to the other sideOnly time will tell my true destinyAs I travel through the astral plainI see the break of dayAs though the sky has burst in flamesBefore the storm I dreadLightning breaks across the skyBlackish-blue at nightRiders ride on dismal cloudsI scream at heaven's light
