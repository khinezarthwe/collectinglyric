I would like to leave this cityThis old town don't smell too pretty, andI can feel the warnin' signsRunnin' around my mindAnd when I leave this islandI'll book myself into a soul asylum'Cause I can feel the warnin' signsRunnin' around my mindSo here I goI'm still scratchin' around in the same old holeMy body feels young, but my mind is very oldSo what do you say?You can't give me the dreams that are mine anywayYou're half the world awayHalf the world awayHalf the world awayI've been lost, I've been foundBut I don't feel downAnd when I leave this planetYou know I'd stay, but I just can't stand it, andI can feel the warnin' signsRunnin' around my mindAnd if I could leave this spiritI find me a hole, and I will fill it, andI can feel the warnin' signsRunnin' around my mindHere I goI'm still scratchin' around in the same old holeMy body feels young, but my mind is very oldSo what do you say?You can't give me the dreams that are mine anywayYou're half the world awayHalf the world awayHalf the world awayI've been lost, I've been foundBut I don't feel downNo, I don't feel downNo, I don't feel downI don't feel downI don't feel downI don't feel downI don't feel down
