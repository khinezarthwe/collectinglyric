Please come back my friendHear the walls have trapped you inTrapped in those damn walls againDon't let them close you inSeeing colours that don't mendThey just whirl and swirl and bendIn all the wrong directionsTo bring you back againI want you backI'll rock you gently in my armsWaterbabies keep a songWhisper softly in your earPlease come back again
