I saw youYou must be older then you lookExposing your inner childNo longer a babyOlder then you lookYou place your innocent hands over mineDying for youDying for youRight back at beginningsWait another dayYou talk to me in that crazy wayNo longer a baby's soul, soul over mineDying for youDying for youI'll wait for youI'm only responding to the innocence in your eyesLove is anyone's guessThese wants and needs we won't repressI wont feel lonely todayOoh and I want you so muchDying for youDying for youI'll wait for youDying for youOoh and I want you so muchNow you see meI see themThey see youAll of these lovers do whatever it is they do
