When you left the house this eveningYou said you'd be back in a little whileBut I've been waiting for such a long timeAnd this waiting is driving me wildAnd while I wait I think about youDo you need me and I'm not there?Are you planning to be without me?Do you have a new affair?You're a bad, bad womanYou're a bad, bad womanPictures of you keep flashing to my mindIf you would only call, if you would be so kindImagine things, I've seen another manAnd it's this waiting I just can't standYou're a bad, bad womanYou're a bad, bad womanYou're a bad, bad womanYou're a bad, bad woman
