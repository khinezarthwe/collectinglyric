It was all simple words, playful at best, so the story starts...Who am I to say she's missing out on anything worth effort these days?She lays in an empty room unconscious as the day passes her by (that's not all)Right away we fell into each other head first, not evenThe shallow sign could stop it when our souls met,Now it's up to us to keep this strongLittle did we know it's planted, something that would tear us apartMy hands fall all over you, not one moment goes to wasteThe room turns to fireI wont let goThe miles start to hurtThe days begin to killIt's all in your eyesIt's the smell of your smoke perfumeSoon love turns to lust then back to. nothingIt was all simple words playful at best, so the story endsI felt the world in you the way you made time changeYou got away with murderThis is not with just raw emotionFrom the hands of a man,Soon love turns to lust then back to nothing.
