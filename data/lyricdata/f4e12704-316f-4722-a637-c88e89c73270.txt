Man we're living in a dangerous timeEvery nation to the father seeks a signYou're either righteous or the heathen infidelIt's only judgment morning every tongue will tellRumours rumours everywhereTimes like this when people careWe got to stand up deal with this fightWe cannot stop till this world is rightTo the sky for your deliverance draws nearBringing the force of love to make hate disappearYer, I know we'll be together, yes I know we love each otherYer, I know we'll be together, yes I know we love each otherHold your corner straight and faithTeach the yoot to stand up in their facePut your armour on each dayWatch your back and what you sayStuck in the middle of the armageddeonSo much fear and contentionNow it'd time to shine your lightHope and pray that we can uniteTo the sky for your deliverance draws nearBring the force of love to make hate disappearYer, I know we'll be together, yes I know we love each otherYer, I know we'll be together, yes I know we love each other
