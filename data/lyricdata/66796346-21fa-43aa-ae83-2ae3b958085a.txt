"I still recall / every summer night / like it was yesterday.The time could never end / and my friends were family.Nothing mattered more / then the loyalty we had.Now I'm a world away from everything we shared.I had something better waiting ahead.I try to take control of my heart.I had something better,But i'll tear it down and I'll tape it up by my own design.I fall.Bring back the days.Three story parking lot.The air is never dry.As the city falls asleep / days bleed into the night.The table set the stage / for a life of memories,But I'm a world away from everything.I fall apart as time passes by.I fall apart but the memories never die.I still recall every summer night.It seems like yesterday,But I'm still a world away."
