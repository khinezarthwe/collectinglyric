Some of the ugliest things took the longest time to makeAnd some of the easiest habits are the hardest ones to breakAnd I'm not asking for value nor the painBut I am askingFor a way out of this lieBecause I can't wait for youTo catch up with meAnd I can't live in the pastAnd drown myself in memoriesWelcome to nowhere and finding out where it isAnd fixing your problems and starting over againYou're feeding your egoWith what you can see outsideAnd you're killing yourselfFor not speaking your mindBecause I can't wait for youTo catch up with meAnd I can't live in the pastAnd drown myself in memoriesIn MemoryI wonder why you make believeYou live your life straight through meI cannot understand whyYou question me and then you lieI will not justify your waysI cannot show you an escapeI do not know you anymoreI never knew you anywayBecause I can't wait for youTo catch up with meAnd I can't live in the pastAnd drown myself in memoriesCuz I can't waitAnd I can't live in the pastAnd drown myself in memoriesIn memoriesIn Memory
