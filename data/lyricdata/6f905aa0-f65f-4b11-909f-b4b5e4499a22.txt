See boy strange on the horizon of loveHe's calling to youWhat do you say?See boy strange as an example of youthSo close to the truthBut still far awayAnd he's such a strange boyD'you think he'll make a good exchange forThe one before a closed doorThat you left behind?When you realise that this boy is strangeIt's too late to change your point of viewHe's often there when the Sun meets the skyWith a perfect alibiUnlike youAnd he's such a strange boyD'you think he'll make a good exchange forThe one before a closed doorThat you left behind?To talk of common sense is a complete waste of timeHis looks are a crimeBound to commitIn the eyes of the worldHe's  borderline foolBoth naive and cruelWhy would you inflictHim on you?And he's such a strange boyD'you think he'll make a good exchange forThe one before a closed doorThat you left behind?And he's such a strange boyD'you think he'll make a good exchange forThe one before a closed doorThat you left behind?
