I'm not so good realizingWho I can or cannot trustIt's best to keep what matters vagueWith harmless lies I can adjustI get a "d" for disappointmentNow there's nothing to regretEverybody's good for somethingAt least you know what you won't getI let you down againWhat's another harmless lie between friends?Now you can be disappointedI thought I gave you just exactly what you wantedI let you down againWhat's another harmless lie between friends?Now you can't be disappointedI thought I gave you just exactly what you wantedI let you down againWhat's another harmless lie between friends?Now you can't be disappointedI thought I gave you just exactly what you wanted
