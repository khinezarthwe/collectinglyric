You called me outYou stayed insideOne you loveIs where you hideShot me down as I flew byCrash and burnI think sometimes you forget where the heart isAnswer no to these questionsLet her go, learn a lessonIt's not me, you're not listeningNow can't you see something's missing?You forget where the heart isI'll Take you away from that empty apartmentYou stay and forget where the heart isSomeday if ever you love me you'd say it's okayWaking up from this nightmareHow's your life, what's it like there?Is it all what you want it to be?Does it hurt when you think about me?And how broken my heart isI'll Take you away from that empty apartmentYou stay and forget where the heart isSomeday if ever you love me you'd say it's okayIt's okay to be angry and never let goIt only gets harder the more that you knowWhen you get lonely if no one's aroundYou know that I'll catch you when you're falling downWe came together but you left aloneAnd I know how it feels to walk out on your ownMaybe someday I will see you againAnd you'll look me in my eyes and call me your friendI'll Take you away from that empty apartmentYou stay and forget where the heart isSomeday if ever you love me you'd say its okayIt's okayIt's okay
