There's a hole in our logicThere's a hole in the skyAnd one day, just like magicWe're all going to die'Cause we didn't turn the lights offAnd we didn't take the busEven though we know we should haveOh, silly old usWell we should have recycledAnd saved our resourcesWhile there's still someone elseâ€™sSomeone call the armed forcesAnd we'll blame it on terrorAlso known as religionBut we shouldn't feel guiltFor protecting our childrenExcuse me, sirBut is this what they call denialJust to carry on regardlessWe'll only do it for a whileWe'll carry on straight down the lineDown the road to nowhereDo you know where it is leading us?And do we even wanna go there?I don't have the answersI don't know where we startStart to pick up all the piecesOf everything we've torn apartNow, you'd think that we'd be gratefulFor the fact we've got a choiceInstead we throw it back at peopleWho don't even have a voiceAnd the teachers always told usTold us we should love thy neighborAnd my mother always told meTold me I should vote New LabourBut I don't know who to trustAnd I just find it all confusingAll as useless as each otherPast the point of being amusingExcuse me, sirBut is this what they call denialJust to carry on regardlessWe'll only do it for a whileWe'll carry on straight down the lineDown the road to nowhereDo you know where it is leading us?And do we even wanna go there?Ahh...Excuse me, sirBut is this what they call denialJust to carry on regardlessWe'll only do it for a whileWe'll carry on straight down the lineDown the road to nowhereDo you know where it is leading us?And do we even wanna go there?
