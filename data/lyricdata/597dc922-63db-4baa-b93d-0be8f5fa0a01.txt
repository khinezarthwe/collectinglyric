The night fell crazy humming 'round my ears (I aim to please)My secrets and a million light yearsThe best performance of my whole career (or so it seemed)You missed it all and left me out to freezePlease don't look at meIt wasn't you I wanted, it was usPlease don't look at meOn solo air guitar, on solo air guitarI only wear these things to see myself (I think it helps)I'd cut my right hand off to please your leftA quarter-hearted, plastic-packed attempt to stay in stepYou'd miss it all and cross me on the stairs
