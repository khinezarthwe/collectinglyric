I am the one, Orgasmatron, the outstretched grasping handMy image is of agony, my servants rape the landObsequious and arrogant, clandestine and vainTwo thousand years of misery, of torture in my nameHypocrisy made paramount, paranoia the lawMy name is called religion, sadistic, sacred whoreI twist the truth, I rule the world, my crown is called deceitI am the emperor of lies, you grovel at my feetI rob you and I slaughter you, your downfall is my gainAnd still you play the sycophant and revel in your painAnd all my promises are lies, all my love is hateI am the politician, and I decide your fateI march before a martyred world, an army for the fightI speak of great heroic days, of victory and mightI hold a banner drenched in blood, I urge you to be braveI lead you to your destiny, I lead you to your graveYour bones will build my palaces, your eyes will stud my crownFor I am Mars, the god of war and I will cut you down
