Swing through sadness, tears of joyCurse the sunlight, arsenic for the girls and boysDrink the madness, smoke so coySmile injectionSerum of a will destroyed, serum of a willSerum of a will destroyedThe seasons change, change without meI remain in shadows growing wingsThe spirit song still surrounds meIn refrain, in shadows growing wingsSwing through sadness, tears of joyCurse the sunlight, arsenic for the girls and boysDrink the madness, smoke so coySmile injectionSerum of a will destroyed, serum of a willSerum of a will destroyedThe seasons change, change without meI remain in shadows growing wingsThe spirit song still surrounds meIn refrain, in shadows growing wingsLike an angel with two broken wingsReach the to sky againLike a devil meant for better thingsI will find my place on highThe seasons change, change without meI remain in shadows growing wingsThe spirit song still surrounds meIn refrain, in shadows growing wings
