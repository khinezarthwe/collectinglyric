Not many run in with the blade.Just always missing the worst but it always comes.Praying to a savior you never loved.They said you made it.A few of us disagree.Compliments of the red letter king.You've made me numb and it's all my fault.My, my I think I've become one of the weak.Maybe I should be leaving give you quite the resting.Forgotten what happiness feels like.I'm the hypocrite you wrote about.
