Come on, come on!Come on, come on!I am overground, out-selling itSince God thinks I don't existThe beatings happen per minuteThis is not blue-collar-white-corrective politicsI'm on an hate-American-style-kickThis is the black collar songPut it in your middle finger and sing alongUse your fist and not your mouth(Come on, come on! Come on, come on!)This is the black collar songPut it in your middle finger and sing alongUse your fist and not your mouth(Come on, come on! Come on, come on!)I'm on a campaign for painAnd when I get electedI'll wipe the white of your houseThe smile off your faceThis is the black collar songPut it in your middle finger and sing alongUse your fist and not your mouth(Come on, come on! Come on, come on!)This is the black collar songPut it in your middle finger and sing alongUse your fist and not your mouth(Come on, come on! Come on, come on!)I woke up today and wished for tomorrowI don't want to be like anyone elseI woke up today and wished for tomorrowI don't want to even be myselfI said, no, this isn't your songWe can't all get alongIt's too hard to hold hands when your hand's a fistMy hate pop won't ever stopI'm fucking glad we're differentThis is my hate-American-style-hitDon't bringDon't sing itUse your fist and not your mouthThis is the black collar songPut it in your middle finger and sing alongUse your fist and not your mouth(Come on, come on! Come on, come on!)This is the black collar songPut it in your middle finger and sing alongUse your fist and not your mouth(Come on, come on! Come on, come on!)This is the black collar songPut it in your middle finger and sing alongUse your fist and not your mouth(Come on, come on! Come on, come on!)This is the black collar songPut it in your middle finger and sing alongUse your fist and not your mouth(Come on, come on! Come on, come on!)I woke up today and wished for tomorrowI don't want to be like anyone elseI woke up today and wished for tomorrowI don't want even be myself
