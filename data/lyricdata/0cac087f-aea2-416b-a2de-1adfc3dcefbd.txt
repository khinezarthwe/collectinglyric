Somewhere in cyberspaceThe minutes turn to hoursThe world is in my handsUnfolding like a flowerA golden energyWas rising out of my headI shed my evil skinAnd found myself again(CHORUS)I was wrong, I don't mindThe impossible seems possibleThis time I'm an electric wireIf the sun can radiate then so can IThis is a good day forA revolution of the mindVoices ride the windAnd take me to the nightI crawled over broken glassTo find a place in the sunWas with me all alongThe circle had begun(CHORUS)I was wrong, I don't mindThe impossible seems possibleThis time I'm an electric wireIf the sun can radiate then so can ISalt and sea of ill stay freeFire and air draw down to meRound and round the circle's bound(CHORUS)I'm an electric wireIf the sun can radiate than so can II don't mindThe impossible seems possibleThis time I'm an electric wireIf the sun can radiate then so can IThen so can I
