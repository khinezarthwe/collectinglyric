Sing a sad song in a lonely placeTry to put a word in for meIt's been so long since I found a spaceYou better put in two or threeWe as people are just walking 'roundOur heads are firmly fixed in the groundWhat we don't see, well, it can't be realWhat we don't touch we cannot feelWhere we're living in this townThe sun is coming up, and it's going downBut it's all just the same at the end of the dayAnd we cheat and we lieNobody says it's wrong, so we don't ask whyCause it's all just the same at the end of the dayWe're throwing it all awayWe're throwing it all awayWe're throwing it all away at the end of the dayIf you're needing something I can giveI know I'd help you if I canIf you're honest, and you say that you didYou know that I would give you my handOr a sad song in a lonely placeI'll try to put a word in for youNeed a shoulder? well, if that's the caseYou know there's nothing I wouldn't doWhere we're living in this townThe sun is coming up and it's going downBut it's all just the same at the end of the dayWhen we cheat and we lieNobody says it's wrong, so we don't ask why'Cause it's all just the same at the end of the dayDon't throw it all awayDon't throw it all awayDon't throw it all awayDon't throw it all away(Throwing it all away)(Throwing it all away)(Throwing it all away)Throwing it all awayThrowing it all awayYou're throwing it all away at the end of the day
