If you tell me to jump, then I'll dieIn my dreams I'm thereI always hoped that I'd learn how to flyIn my dreams I'm thereYou can tie my hands to the wallsBut you can't tie my dreams to this placeI might fall like a rock from your heartBut you won't see me fall from graceFate always loses holdLike electric sparks in my heartFate always loses holdNow be a good girl and do what you're toldIf you tell me to jump, then I'll dieIn my dreams I'm thereI always hoped that I'd learn how to flyIn my dreams I'm thereI leave my memoirs in blood on the floorAnd my fears with the nurse on the stairsI'm only going where you'll be somedaySo don't say rest in peace in your prayersFate always loses holdLike electric sparks in my heartFate always loses holdNow be a good girl and do what you're toldI hope youRemember meI hope youNever pretend for meI hope youRemember meI hope youFate always loses holdLike electric sparks in my heartFate always loses holdNow be a good girl and do what you're toldI hope youRemember meI hope youNever pretend for meI hope youRemember meI hope youNever forget about meI hope youRemember meI hope youNever pretend for meI hope youRemember meI hope you
