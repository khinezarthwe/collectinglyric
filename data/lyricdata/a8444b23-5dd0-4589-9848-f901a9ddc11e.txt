It is the nightMy body's weakI'm on the runNo time to sleepI've got to rideRide like the windTo be free againAnd I've got such a long way to goTo make it to the border of MexicoSo I'll ride like the windRide like the windI was born the son of a lawless manAlways spoke my mind with a gun in my handLived nine livesGunned down tenGonna ride like the windAnd I've got such a long way to goTo make it to the border of MexicoSo I'll ride like the windRide like the windAccused and tried and told to hangI was nowhere in sight when the church bells rangNever was the kind to do as I was toldGonna ride like the wind before I get oldIt is the nightMy body's weakI'm on the runNo time to sleepI've got to rideRide like the windTo be free againAnd I've got such a long way to goTo make it to the border of MexicoSo I'll ride like the windRide like the wind
