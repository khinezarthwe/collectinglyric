I've beenTraveling the land from gravel into sandNot knowin' where Im goin', never havin' any plansAnything I wanted had to grab it in advanceAbracadabra, there's a rabbit in my hands, 'causeI've got the magic stick bust the baddest tricksFished for a whale brought a ship up out of itWhat's that I just saw? A platypus? NawMaybe its a rat crawling flat on his pawsOr a baby dragon just draggin' his clawsIt doesn't really matterBecause its SaturdaySo look that away3:00 clock matin√©eLet's collaborateAnd I'll pay ya back soonWith a crazy rap tuneBut for now were just gazin' at the moonWander and ponder the pale blue yonderTo infinity and beyond the cityBeyond the city, we all want to see serenityBut some times you've gotta hop the fence to seeThat all sidewalks must end eventuallyI sit still at the bottom of the seaBrainwaves chill like a sea anemoneSentient entityLet the spirit enter mePatient, pervasive, how I was meant to beA stone worn smooth by the swift currents of chaosA place to lay a thick array of lush mossI'm parlaying on my day offFloatin' way off on my thought balloons and snackin' on macaroonsBut for now I'm just gazin' at the moon
