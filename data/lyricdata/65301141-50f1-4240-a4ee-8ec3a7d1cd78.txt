I used to think it glad while at my country seatNow I'm peaking in so many waysthe gloom is in retreatYeah the dark epoch is over I've found my efeblumThen passed Ernst's mausoleum defended by a rookWho shot a look so virulent it pierced me like a hookThe palaver of Solipsists exploding in my skullYeah and we both despise all of the academic swineWho made the author of "Discus Ulysses" benign?So what if Wednesday finds usWearing rabies parachutesFoaming like the melody of sea foam fairy flutesThe atmosphere is viscous we're sticking to the brineYeah and we both despise all of the academic swineWho made the author of "Discus Ulysses" benign?When the lanterns fill with finchesSo begins the brawlTheir brains are like porcupinesAnd mine's a paper ballWhen the lanterns fill with finchesSo begins the brawlTheir brains are like porcupinesAnd mine's a paper ballI know they don't understand they don't get us at allTheir moss mangles polyanthusAnd mine's a paper ball
