All I need is a catheter and lobotomyEverything will be clean and clear and clutter-freeTake my hand and we'll go off to the promised landTip-toe through the tulips, vacancy is so grandIt's a union made in heavenEveryone will attend a receptionConsummate with no conceptionOur world will be perfectionI'll have a hysterectomyAnd we'll live our lives problem-freeNo need to think independentlyYour vasectomy will make our world completeIt's a union made in heavenEveryone will attend a receptionConsummate with no conceptionOur world will be perfectionWe'll talk alike, we'll act alikeWe'll never fightWe'll eat the same, dress the sameWe are the sameProverbial monogomyMénage à trois - that's not for meWe two are one, it's not for someBut it's all that I needIt's a union made in heavenEveryone will attend a receptionConsummate with no conceptionOur world will be perfectionIt's the greatest love song (x7)It's the greatest, greatest love song
