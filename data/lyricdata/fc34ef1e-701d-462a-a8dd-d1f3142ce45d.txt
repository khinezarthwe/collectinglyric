These waters bleed of the faith insured, and Im chasing bottles, stuck on the shore.Reading peoples wishes like they were my own.This catatonic love leaves me breathless sometimes.Girl I wanna Hold On.I never should have Let Go Of YouAnd I say Oh Oh, lets keep this thing alive.Are You Satisfied?As to a question, are we secured?Cause now Im not so sure we ever were.How could you do what you did?Now don't be shy, choke on every word until we find a reply.And cold, is what you made it.Its what you sold.I bought it last year, its getting old.How could you do all the things you did?I should have told you that Girl I wanna Hold On.I never should have Let Go Of You.And I said Oh Oh, lets keep this thing alive.Are You Satisfied?You make me younger.I swore my days were numbered.Cold, is what you made it.Its what you sold.I bought it last year, its getting old.How could you do all the things you did?I should have told you, I wanna Hold On.You're showing me a New Point Of View.And I said Oh O, lets keep this thing alive.Are you Satisfied?
