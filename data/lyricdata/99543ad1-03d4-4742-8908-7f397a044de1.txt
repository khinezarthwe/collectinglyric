I'm standing outsideeverything is rushing around meall lights are getting darkI close my eyesand feel the being of the peopleoscillating through my handsWe are the watchers of the worldObserving every single moveAs long as we wish to make a changeAs long as we can feel your painWe are the watchers of the worldcounting every word we speakWe are the watchers of the worldFrom the moment we were bornAs long as we wish to careAs long as we can feel your loveWe are the watchers of the worldcounting every heartbeatI'm looking insideeveryone is cold and lonelytheir hearts are getting darkI close my eyesand feel the souls of the peopleslipping through my hands
