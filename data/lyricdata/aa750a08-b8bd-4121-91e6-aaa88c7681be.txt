I built a ship with my own handsTo take us to the moonI took a pen in my own handAnd wrote you a hundred tunesNow I'm crazy for you but not that crazyI'm crazy for you but not that crazyI pretended you were JesusYou were just dying to save meI stood beneath your windowWith my ukuleleI made my yard a playgroundJust in case we had a babyNow I'm crazy for you but not that crazyI'm crazy for you but not that crazyI treated you like radiumI treated you like GodYou were my glass menagerieDid you not find that oddI dwelt within and went withoutAnd broke my virgin fleshI performed acts of devotionAs if you were Ganesh, butNow I'm crazy for you but not that crazyI'm crazy for you but not that crazy
