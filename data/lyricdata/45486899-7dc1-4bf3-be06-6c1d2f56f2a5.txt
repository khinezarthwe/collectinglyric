Meet me after dark again and I'll hold youI am nothing more than to see you thereAnd maybe tonight, we'll fly so far awayWe'll be lost before the dawnIf only night can hold you where I can see you, my loveThen let me never ever wake againAnd maybe tonight, we'll fly so far awayWe'll be lost before the dawnSomehow I know that we can't wake again from this dreamIt's not real, but it's oursMaybe tonight, we'll fly so far awayWe'll be lost before the dawnMaybe tonight, we'll fly so far awayWe'll be lost before the dawn
