One last dance before we goAnd trust sticks in my throatYou never loved yourself this muchSo don't expect it to lastThe last time I was hereYou were naked and I drank your beerAnd you hit me and I nearly hit you backOne last drink before we driveOh, you drive drunk so wellWe couldn't hope to respect these peopleThey don't even know the placeBut they'll name this place after youCos one day you will die hereYour legs are still firmAnd your teeth are still whiteAnd I nearly hit you backThe last time I was hereYou were naked and I drank your beerAnd you hit me and I nearly hit you back
