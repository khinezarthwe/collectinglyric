Born Again ChristianI remember your poor old soulWas it lack of faith back then?Cause it was pretty rough, you knowYou didn't mean to hurt usIt was all some devil's workForgive and forget is now forced upon usBut I, I don't wan't to be badSo at this Holy CommunionBring in more wineBut then just get off my backLeave me lost and lonelyThat zealot stare of yoursOnly serves to bring me downAs do the leaflets that youSpread all over townBut it's not your commitment, it's yourPhony faith and outright liesBorn Again virgins that I despiseBut I, I don't want to be badSo at this Holy CommunionBring in more wineBut then just get off my backLeave me lost and lonelyI'm sure he lets you inFor all the work you've done
