I'm lucky, I can open the door and I can walk down the streetUnlucky, I've got no place to go and so I follow my feetA choice is facing you, a healthy dose of painA choice is facing you as you stare through the rainA choice is facing you but I choose to refrain for todayTomorrow we'll be back in trouble againDream one, you had a whole lot of fun with a comedianStop short of going all the way, you'll have to make it somedayWhy is this happening to you, you're not a child?Why is this happening? You've too much on your mindThings creep up on you when you are fast asleepYou are dreaming, you are sleepyYou are stuck to the sheetsIn a town so small there's no escaping youIn a town so small there's no escape from viewIn a town so small there's nothing left to doDream two you couldn't see her face, but you saw everything elseDream two was pretty special, easily beats loving yourselfCould you put a name to someone elses sigh?Could you put a face to someone elses eyes?Is it someone that you'd maybe recognise?But it all fades into morning when you open your eyes
