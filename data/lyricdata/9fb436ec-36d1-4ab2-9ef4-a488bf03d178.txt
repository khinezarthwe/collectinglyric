I can't know whatYou feel insideBut your face can'tHide your foolish prideKeep in mind all you left behindWas in chains that bind:Is that a sign?I can't read what youKeep inside your mindProtecting what IFind within your wallsThings I feel thatI know just can't be realTrick and try to steal my life awayCold deception goes both waysWatch yourself or you'll get bathedIn the darkness that is lightAs your spirit dies tonightI'll tell you somethingI know I must be strongFor your giving me somethingThat I know is wrongI can't know what you feel insideBut your face can'tHide your foolish prideKeep in mind all you left behindWas in chains that bind:is that a sign?Your intentions become clearAll deceptions disappearThe inception of your planMarks the end of modern manI'll tell you somethingI know I must be strongFor your giving me somethingThat I know is wrong
