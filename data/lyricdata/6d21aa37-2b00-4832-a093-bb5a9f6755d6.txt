I went down an empty lane, searching for a songCame back an empty man, my whiskers they hung longLord, they hung longYes I am your native son despite my queer disguiseBut I keep all I can call my own in the bags beneath my eyesUnderneath my eyesOh Miss Meri, don't despairWe got ways to numb your painSame old story; blood, sweat, gloryJust hope all your trials weren't in vainTo all my so-called countrymen who bless this stolen groundIs Jesus gonna pick you up when your hunger weighs you downWhen it weighs you downMama come and save me nothing's sacred anymoreWhat good was living for?I been wondering just who misplaced my soulThere's pockets in my holesAnd way out on the open plain, men pave beneath the sunThe great suburban dawn, if you build it they will comeThey will come, they will comeOh Miss Meri, don't despairWe got ways to numb your painSame old story; blood, sweat, gloryI just hope all your trials weren't in vainI went down an empty lane, searching for a songCame back an empty man, my whiskers they hung longLord, they hung longLord, they hung long
