Please don't touch meI've come too far to let you bring me downHe's thinks that I'm easyBut try as you might, you can't have me nowThese tedious dancesWe run through, but I've memorized them nowI quietly melt downAnd consent to you if only just to ballAs I stare through you and I stand quite stillAnd an alarm sounds just up the roadI can tell you'd like some companyBut I can't fix you when you don't want meI call for the witnessPresent the facts right down to the little thingsThey say the heart is resilientIn black and white you swore there'd be no stringsI sneak out the back doorBut the gavel strikes and I can hear you cryUnder the sound of my footstepsThis time there will be no long goodbyeAs I stare through you and I stand quite stillAnd an alarm sounds just up the roadI can tell you'd like some sympathyBut I can't fix you when you don't want meHow can I trust you?How could you need me now?It's getting to be so cold, coldThe decision is in, and I won't breakYou cut and you run with our lives at stakeWell, someone might get hurtAnd it won't be meThe decision is in, there will be no fightIt might sound cold, but I know its right'Cause someone must get hurtAnd it won't be me
