Everything is bleakIt's the middle of the nightYou're all aloneAnd the dummies might be rightYou feel like a jerkMy music at workMy music at workAvoid trends and clichesDon't try to be up to dateAnd when the sunlight hits the olive-oilDon't hesitateThe night's so long it hurtsMy music at workIn a symbol too farOr the anatomy of a stainTo determine where you areIn a sink full of Ganges I'd remainNo matter what you heardMy music at workMy music at workMy music at workI call it "Olga WaitsThe Cloud That EntertainsThe Dim PossibilityOf Showing Some Restraint"The rain came down berserkMy music at workMy music at workOn a star beyond the chartOr the dark side of a drop of rainDetermining where you areIn a sink full of Ganges I'd remainNo matter what you heardMy music at workMy music at workMy music at workLa la la la la laLa la la la la la la laLa la la la la laLa la la la la la la laEverything is bleakIt's the middle of the nightYou're all aloneAnd the dummies might be rightOutside the darkness lurksMy music at workMy music at workHey, fallen hummingbirdMy music at workFrom the middle of the earthMy music at workBound for bed without dessertMy music at workIt's my music at workMy music at work
