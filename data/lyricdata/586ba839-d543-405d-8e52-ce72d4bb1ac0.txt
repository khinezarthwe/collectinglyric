So trueFunny how it seemsAlways in time, but never in line for dreamsHead over heels when toe to toeThis is the sound of my soulThis is the soundI bought a ticket to the worldBut now I've come back againWhy do I find it hard to write the next line?Oh, I want the truth to be saidI know this much is trueI know this much is trueWith a thrill in my head and a pill on my tongueDissolve the nerves that have just begunListening toThis is the sound of my soulThis is the soundAlways slipping from my handsSand's a time of its ownTake your seaside arms and write the next lineOh, I want the truth to be knownI know this much is trueI know this much is trueI bought a ticket to the worldBut now I've come back againWhy do I find it hard to write the next line?Oh, I want the truth to be saidI know this much is trueI know this much is trueThis much is trueI know, I know, I know this much is trueI know this much is trueKnow this much is trueI know, I know, I know this much is true
