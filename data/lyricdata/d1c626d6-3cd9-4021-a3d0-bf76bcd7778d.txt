Innocence tainted by pure lunacyCursed by the slash of a shape-shifting beastOh no, this can't beDemonic infection, a doomed changelingHis future concealed as he begs to be toldA kiss from the gypsy, he'll never grow oldOh no, this can't beDemonic infection, a doomed changeling(Chorus)Even a man who's pureAnd says his prayers by night(He won't hear your prayers)Man become a wolfWhen the wolf bane blooms,And the autumn moon is bright(There's a full moon tonight)Man may become a wolf.He who is bitten by a wolf and livesPossession soon follows, no use to resistOh no, this can't beCursed by the moonlight, a doomed changelingThe madness a turmoil that swells up insideTo truly find peace is to truly dieOh no, this can't beCursed by the moonlight, a doomed changelingNow comes the rampage, a killing spreeHunting his loved ones comes instinctivelyOh no, it's maddeningA shape-shifting demon of pure lunacyA shot from the darkness tears through its fleshA bullet of silver lays it to restOh no, it's maddeningAn innocent victim finds his peace.
