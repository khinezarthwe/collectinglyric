I was your lover, you were my planI told you that you were the sun in the sandBut we'd ride away and get a circus jobAnd I'd fly away, become a bird of songEl camino, take me homeEl camino, take me homeYou are a jester and I am elfAnd I'm sad to the bones thatIt's stocked upon my shelfTake me back to the river of dirtTake me back to the river of dirtBuilt of the veins, and the flesh and the bonesWe are all so painfully aloneBurn in the rivers of dirt and fireWe return to the ground where we retireBack to river of dirt and fireSummer is coming; I can't believe it's trueWhere are you, where is she? I'm turning into youTake me back to the place of the golden slumbersWhere I was happy you were my middle nameTake me back to the river of dirtTake me back to the river of dirtNow, I grew up in the houses made of menThe walls where white, the stairs were sharpThe scent of summer landTake me back to the river of dirtTake me back to the river of dirt
