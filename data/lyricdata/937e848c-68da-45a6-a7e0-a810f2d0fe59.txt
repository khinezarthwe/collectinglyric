How many roads you've traveledHow many dreams you've chasedAcross sand and sky and gravelLooking for one safe placeWill you make a smoother landingWhen you break your fall from graceInto the arms of understandingLooking for one safe placeLife is trial by fireAnd love's the sweetest tasteAnd I pray it lifts us higherTo one safe placeHow many roads we've traveledHow many dreams we've chasedAcross sand and sky and gravelLooking for one safe place
