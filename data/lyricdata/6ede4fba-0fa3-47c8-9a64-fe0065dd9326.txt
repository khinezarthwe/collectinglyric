I got a shirt made by little girl's hands,In a little warehouse on a little island.I bet she's even got herself a little boyfriend,But she'd drop him in a flash for an American man.We're coming to get you.We're coming to save you.We're coming to free you,From those who enslave you.Energy is constant, gentlemen are temporary.Never eat an apple from an orchard that was formerly a (cemetery).Subsidiaries and any lesser than,Sit and be quiet until I invert the pentagram.(Rack of lamb)Bethlehem style,(Trained) love this,(Pagan gods love this).Fuck shrimp cocktail.(Get your girl's hair crimped)Take her to a yard sale.(Donkey Elephant Hypercop be written by Disneyland)Take the turban off,Put holy water parks in rediscovered sand.Wait! Let's tell the truth. (Yeah)We're not holier than thou, but holy cow!There's people doing stuff God would never allow,Like guys kissin' guys and poor people too,There's plenty of jobs, find something to do!We think abortion is pretty messed up.If you don't want a kid, then don't be a slut.There's plenty of races on God's green planet,That doesn't mean you have to breed with them, goddamn it!I got a shirt made by little girl's hands,In a little warehouse on a little island.I bet she's even got herself a little boyfriend,But she'd drop him in a flash for an American man.We're coming to get you.We're coming to save you.We're coming to free you,From those who enslave you.
