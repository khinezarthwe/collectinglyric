Another stone rolls overThe republic is just one more year olderBut way out in the distanceWe see your white boots glisten in the sunWe know you've come here with a planTo lift our city out of ruinShoulders back and arms at our sidesWe sincerely hope you know just what you're doingAnother stone rolls overThe republic is just one more year olderBut way out in the distanceWe see you draw your pistols and aim at usAt first we try to reason with youBut you suggest we say our prayersShoulder back and arms in the skyWe sincerely hope you live a better lifeCause youYou're so calmI don't know where you are fromYouYou're so youngI don't care what you've done wrong
