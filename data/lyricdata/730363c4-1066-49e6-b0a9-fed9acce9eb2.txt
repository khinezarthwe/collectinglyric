I could say that I'll always be here for youBut that would be a lie and quite a pointless thing to doAnd I could say that I'll always have feelings for youBut I've got a life ahead of me and I'm only 22Since you've gone I've lost a chip on my shoulderSince you've gone I feel like I've gotten olderAnd now you're gone it feels as if the whole wide world is my stageAnd now you're gone it's like I've been let out of my cageYou always made it clear that you hated my friendsYou made me feel so guilty when I was running 'round with themAnd everything was always about being coolAnd now I've come to realise there's nothing cool about you at allSince you've gone I've lost a chip on my shoulderSince you've gone I feel like I've gotten olderAnd now you're gone it feels as if the whole wide world is my stageAnd now you're gone it's like I've been let out of my cageSince you've gone I've lost a chip on my shoulderSince you've gone I feel like I've gotten olderAnd now you're gone it feels as if the whole wide world is my stageAnd now you're gone it's like I've been let out of my cage
