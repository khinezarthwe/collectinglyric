Boy, oh, boy I'm feeling highIt just happens to me at nightAre you ready for signs?Tie my choke up on this punchlineJumping with no parachuteStudly when I start to shootMy load is pretty heavy,But you swallow 'cause you think I'm cuteTwo times might be one too muchI'm losing sight, I'm losing touchOf the reality I was facing when I was growing up.If you front, you can go fuck yourself in the backAll those beats, all those rhymes just kept blowin' my stackOn the internet you can tick this, I got the good gradesOnly four singles, our popularity don't fadeTwo times might be one too muchI'm losing sight, I'm losing touchOf the reality I was facing when I was growing up.I put my name on the mapMy pop, you're calling me thatYour boyfriend's harrassing meAnd you should tell him to stop.I'm off another levelI got upgraded, I dedicate this song to my fans on steroidsI am the short circuit of this electronicI am the start-up chick and my voice bionicI got a good teamI'm on your widescreenI'm all about my green since I turned fourteenTwo times might be one too muchI'm losing sight, I'm losing touchOf the reality I was facing when I was growing up.
