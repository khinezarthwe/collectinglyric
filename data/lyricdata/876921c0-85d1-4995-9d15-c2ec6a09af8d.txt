Underneath the gun in front of waiting eyesOur time has just begun no second chance tonightSo we walk the longest days to live inside the shortest nightsWe compromise our hearts to keep them satisfiedThe shadows of our past, hard to ignore but judgment means nothing that's not what we're fighting forWe don't care anymoreWe don't care anymoreWe don't care anymoreWe don't care anymoreUnderneath the gun in front of doubting eyesWe walk this path as one take on the world tonightAnd we'll carve our names into their bonesWe'll never sell ourselves that's not what we're fighting forWe don't care anymoreWe don't care anymoreWe don't care anymoreWe don't care anymoreI won't let this love, I won't let this love die, I won't let it dieThere is only one thing that matters this timeAt the hands of judgment I won't let it die, no sacrifice, regrets left behind, I won't let it dieThis time, yeah, this time I won't let it die, that's not what we're fighting forWe don't care anymoreWe don't care anymoreWe don't care anymoreWe don't care anymoreWe don't care anymoreNo we don't care anymoreWe don't care anymoreWe don't care anymoreI won't let this love, I won't let this love die
