I wouldn't waste my timeWith anyone but youBut wasting time is all I doHolding on to self controlGets harder every dayTorture me no more or go awayI wait for you To see the truthI'll tell myself you'llLearn the answerI'll count the daysI've suffered throughTo see if they add up to youI never look into your eyesTo see the truthI know I'll never become youTell me why your conscience liesAnd all your guilt is goneDon't you feel you ever could be wrong?I wait for you to learn the answerI'll count the daysI've suffered throughTo see if they add up to youIt never pays To struggle throughWhen all that's left is killing you
