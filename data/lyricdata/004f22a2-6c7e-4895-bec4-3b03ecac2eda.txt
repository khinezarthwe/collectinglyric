I feel your heart beatYour pasty hands shakeI'll be every breathYour trembling lips tasteMetal teeth try to save youButton flies want to keep you pureNothing can stop me nowI will have youI was born to do this danceSo follow my every stepI'll lead your careening hipsAnd slaughter your innocenceHer pearls and trap mutter something softI whisper back, "You're messin' with theBig leagues now, hun"I bite her neckShe begs, "What's in your heart?"She urges I spill my thoughtsI volunteer nothing but liquidI was born to do this danceSo follow my every stepI'll lead your careening hipsAnd slaughter your innocenceI have got centuriesOf teachers before meI can do anythingBut I can't really do anythingYou've been our guest tonightBut I dine aloneThis could never be a home
