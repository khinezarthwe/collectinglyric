Here she comes againIt's funny how she keeps you hangin' aroundActing out a scene that she had seen the night beforeTo help her understandShe keeps a picture in her handHere she comes againWearing all the wares she cares to holdShe's at the open window with a blanket for a coatAnd laughing at your jokesBut her words they only sound like shields, yeahI wonder what she's doing nowSince I've seen her it's been so longAh you've seen the way she isIt's hard to keep a holdWhen she keeps you waiting in the roadHere she comes againMopping off the fever from your browIf only she'd believe you when you say thatYou're the one to keep her satisfiedShe just says you're making too much noise, yeahConstantly turning yourself in her circlesAnd rolling yourself into a tight little ballYou were thinking she couldMaybe reach a hand out to find youBut someone's got to hold up these wallsHere she comes againShowing you the corner of a noteLooking like a woman in the spotlight on the floorBut when the day returnsYou see she's just a little girlHere she comes againHere she comes againHere she comes again
