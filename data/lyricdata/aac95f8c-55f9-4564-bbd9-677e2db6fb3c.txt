Cut up and call called awayCacaphonously playedYou wound me upI said I would never be your apologistI'm sorry I'm sorry but I've got something to sayI'm just a bit frustratedI know you're smartYou know your partBut you don't know what to sayI watched you partThen I got hardAnd couldn't stand up straightAnd tomorrow I'll be longingBut today belongs to meAnd this settlement is so unsettlingBut I can't get sentimental over youNo I can't get sentimental over youNo no noI can't get sentimental over youNo I can't get sentimental over youA subtle double-playYou play me for a foolAnd you play deadI said I would never say anythingIt's alright it's alright it's alright it's alrightCause I have nothing to sayI've waited and I've waitedAnd I said itI said itI said what you wouldn't say you knew that I would sayI said it, oh I said it! Oh I said it!When I hear my train a'comingI'm gonna tie you to the tracksI can't wait
