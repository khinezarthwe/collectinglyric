I've just turned twenty six and she was twenty threeShe wore a crucifix but never preached at meWe'd stay up all the night until the day was deadI get the feel of God inside my broken headWanna fly away and change my waysI'll beat myself to death while she sits next to meI wanna free myself from all this miseryI wanna taste the love and life she gives to meBut I am my own worst enemyI try to get some sleep, her arms are over meI'm staring at the walls they're closing in on meThe sun bleeds through the blinds and washes over meToday's the day I tell myself to set me freeWanna fly away and change my waysI'll beat myself to death while she sits next to meI wanna free myself from all this miseryI wanna taste the love and life she gives to meBut I am my own worst enemyFeel, wanna feel it, wanna feel it, wanna feel itWanna feel it, wanna feel it, wanna feel it, wanna feel itI wanna fly away and change my waysI'll beat myself to death while she sits next to meI wanna free myself from all this miseryI wanna taste the love and life she gives to meBut I am my own worst enemyWorst enemy, worst enemy, worst enemy
