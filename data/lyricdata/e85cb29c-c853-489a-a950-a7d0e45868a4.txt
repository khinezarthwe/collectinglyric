In the summertimeI don't know if the stars were alignedWe stumbled onto something we would likeAnd I'm afraid I lost the words tonightAnd in your summer dress I was holding youBut you were holding lessIt's not the words it's the ones you stress"I'll love you is I love you just don't love me less."And once in a whileI know our hearts beat out of timeAnd once in a whileI know they'll fall back in lineAnd in the summertimeI don't know if the stars were alignedWe stumbled onto something we would likeI'm afraid I lost the words tonightAnd when we're middle-agedYou'll tell me I loved you like a renegadeAnd how I say the things that make you swayAnd mostly told you you did the sameOnce in a whileI know our hearts beat out of timeAnd once in a whileI know they'll fall back in lineOur love is strongOur love is strongOur love is strongWhile my heart's still pumping blood
