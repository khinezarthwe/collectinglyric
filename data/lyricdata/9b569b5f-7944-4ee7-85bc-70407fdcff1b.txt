Heat wave boilingand New York's a jungleLovers wantedCoked up night companionI wipe the sweat from my faceIn the summertimeI fear I'm gonna lose my mindBut she's always avoiding falling in loveYes, it's due to a life of a private affairShe's always avoiding falling in loveYes, it's due to a life of a private affairCurtains clapping thrown open windowEyes are watchingNeon lights, the cracks in the pavement lure me awayIn the summertimeI fear I'm gonna lose my mindBut she's always avoiding falling in loveYes, it's due to a life of a private affairShe's always avoiding falling in loveYes, it's due to a life of a private affairI was a playboy from Dubai to ParisShe wore a necklace made of pharaohs bonesMade our acquaintance on a sheet less mattressShe pressed my lips, she said this won't last longBut she's always avoiding falling in loveYes, it's due to a life of a private affairShe's always avoiding falling in loveYes, it's due to a life of a private affairShe's always avoiding falling in loveYes, it's due to a life of a private affairShe's always avoiding falling in loveYes, it's due to a life of a private affair
