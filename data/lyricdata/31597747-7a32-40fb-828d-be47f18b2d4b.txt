Follow meTo the shipwreck shores of a dark and strange countryI was bornA stranger thinking out loud in a foreign tongueI was out of placeI was looking all around just a'trying to find a friendly faceBut they're all goneDid you ever thinkDid you ever think, thinkA lotta people everyday who will surely drownDid you ever thinkDid you ever think, thinkWho left me all alone in this town?And a busted heart is a welcome friendAnd when that heart leaves, what will you do then?And if I cry, is that a sin?And the wisdom is a whisperAnd I'm trying to understandWhat I say, what I think, where I sleep, when I breatheWhat I do with my hands
