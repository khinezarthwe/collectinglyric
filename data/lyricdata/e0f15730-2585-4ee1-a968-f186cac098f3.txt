Four o'clock in the morning nowWell I can't sleep for loveBeen waiting for you to callTo say you love me enoughLost my head that unhappy nightPlease forgive every wordI see it all much clearer nowIt all seems so absurdBut my plane leaves at 10AMWe both know I must goTo return I must be toldThat you know what I knowCall me, baby, call meTo tell the truth I don't want to goSo say you want me to stayYou are more than all to meThis is no game that I playBut my plane leaves at 10AMWe both know I must goTo return I must be toldThat you know what I knowCall me, baby, call meBut my plane leaves at 10AMWe both know I must goTo return I must be toldThat you know what I knowCall me, baby, call meSay you love me, say you doLet me love youTell me that you want me to stay
