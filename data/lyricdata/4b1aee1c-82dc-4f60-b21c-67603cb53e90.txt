Now here you go againYou say you want your freedomWell, who am I to keep you down?It's only right that you shouldPlay the way you feel itBut listen carefully to the soundOf your lonelinessLike a heartbeat, drives you madIn the stillness of remembering what you hadAnd what you lostAnd what you hadAnd what you lostOh, thunder only happens when it's rainingPlayers only love you when they're playingThey say women, they will come and they will goWhen the rain washes you clean, you'll knowYou'll knowNow here I go againI see the crystal visionI keep my visions to myselfIt's only me who wants toWrap around your dreams andHave you any dreams you'd like to sell?Dreams of lonelinessLike a heartbeat, drives you madIn the stillness of remembering what you hadAnd what you lostAnd what you hadOoh, what you lostThunder only happens when it's rainingPlayers only love you when they're playingWomen, they will come and they will goWhen the rain washes you clean you'll knowOh, thunder only happens when it's rainingPlayers only love you when they're playingThey say women, they will come and they will goWhen the rain washes you clean you'll knowYou'll knowYou will knowOh, you'll know
