Lightning crashes, a new mother criesHer placenta falls to the floorThe angel opens her eyesThe confusion sets inBefore the doctor can even close the doorLightning crashes, an old mother diesHer intentions fall to the floorThe angel closes her eyesThe confusion that was hersBelongs now, to the baby down the hallOh now I feel it coming back againLike a rollin' thunder chasing the windForces pullin' from the center of the earth againI can feel itLightning crashes, a new mother criesThis moment she's been waiting forThe angel opens her eyesPale blue colored iris presents the circlePuts the glory out to hide, hideOh, now I feel it coming back againLike a rollin' thunder chasing the windForces pullin' from the center of the earth againI can feel itI can feel itOh, IOh, IOh, II can feel it comin' back againLike a rollin' thunder chasing the windForces pullin' from the center of the earth againI can feel itI can feel it coming back againLike a rollin' thunder chasing the windForces pullin' from the center of the earth againI can feel itI can feel it coming back againLike a rollin' thunder chasing the windForces pullin' from the center of the earth againI can feel itI can feel itI can feel it
