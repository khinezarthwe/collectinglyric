Living on them pills lying in squalor,That's the life of the late night bar crawlerMost outrageous man I met he once said, "I could take a belly full of lead and wouldn't wind up dead."He wants his song to make you shiver a little like there's a ghost coming your wayHave you ever been told that something's forever, and had your heart broken the very next day.Shout it from the rooftopYou can shout it from the rooftopBut you can't tell it to the paper, they've already been paidTo be ten different people that's easy, it's easier than being yourselfI'm the one off pretender I'm not happy, picking life off the shelfHe taught me, time wasted, is time spent wellThe mans dead if he doesn't have a story to tellDead if he's lying in a dirty jail cellCoz when your down they'll kick you, the jury doesn't matter at allThe jury doesn't matter at allTell me officer when your baton kissed me, did it make you feel tall?And no one asked you where you come from,No one told you of these times,And no one asked you where you come from,No one told you of these times.This is your life don't waste it,Why don't you run away?A man to reckon with he knows how to persuade,Says you won't get a sun tan in this government shade,Does it make you quiver a little, the way they say,"We're gonna fuck you , take a little bit of freedom away every day.You can shout it from the rooftopsYou can shout it from the rooftopsYou can shout it from the rooftopsBut you can't tell it to the paper, they've already been paid.
