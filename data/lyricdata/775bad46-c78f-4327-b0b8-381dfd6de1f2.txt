Flogging a rocking HorseGetting nowhereWe are a pair to beholdYou like a funeral me like a fairNobody cares for the showThese days the rapids may drag us from hereAnd I do not care where we goAnd you say that love is what we are my dearBut I just pretend not to knowIf it's the be all and end allThen come on now love lets make a startWhen love calls then it's time to play ballBut starting's the easiest partCounting my blessings like stars in the skyThe sleep walking moon watching onAnd she's seen how lovers before us have triedMy darling lets not get it wrongIf it's the be all and end allThen come on now love lets make a startWhen love calls how sudden the fallBut falling's the easiest partI've had love come to nothing beforeBut it's alright it's alrightI've welcomed it inAnd I've shown it the doorBut it's alright it's alright
