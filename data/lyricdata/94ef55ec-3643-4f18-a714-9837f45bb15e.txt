When we hear that song, we will danceWhen we're with all our friends, we will drink and laughWhen we're driving in our cars, we will singIf you're lost and you look, you will find meBut what I couldn't do is figure out how youYou jumped into my heart, now I couldn't startTo think of life without you, my world would stopAnd fall down again, all black and blue againI want to know everything about youWhat makes you feel alive?And I want to know everything that you doSo let's drive through the nightWhen you show me your world, I just smiledAnd then I sit with you now, I can rememberThat when we forget about everything that hurts usHow nothing in the world seems to be‘Cause nothing can hurt usLike Wilson Bentley found on black velvetA beauty so strange, something he didn't expectIt's a unique find that only some people getAnd you are mine‘Cause I want to know everything about youWhat makes you feel alive?And I want to know everything that you doSo let's drive through the nightPut your hands on my heartSpray paint verses on a cold blue wallWrite our names in the burning sandWatch as snowflakes melt inside our hands‘Cause I want to know everything about youWhat makes you feel alive?And I want to know everything that you doSo let's drive through the night
