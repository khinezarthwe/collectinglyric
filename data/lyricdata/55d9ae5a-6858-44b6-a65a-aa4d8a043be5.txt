If my car won't start until the morning comesWith a tankful of gas and with the radio onBeautiful music: velvet undergroundSuch a nice drive with the velvet undergroundSuch a nice drive, we're looking at the countrysideWith te golden sky above, fighting with the farmer's wifeMy hands full of mud and blood. i think she deserves itFor the harm she did to my brothers the pigs and my sisters the cowsWhat a hard fight with the farmer's wifeWhat a hard fight but the bitch she deserves itAnd after all this when you look at me babyWill you see as a vegetarian hero?Will you remember my name? will you say my name?Will you spell my name with your high school friends?Sitting on the staircase, on the staircase over thereSitting on the staircase, smoking weed on the staircase
