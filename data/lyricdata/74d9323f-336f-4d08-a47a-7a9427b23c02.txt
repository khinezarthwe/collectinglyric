Heavy soulWe're words upon a windowWritten there in steamIn the heat of the momentAt the birth of a dreamVapors passing reallySo I'm touched by the thoughtsIn the fleeting minutes afterThe time that we've comeCome and go, you know, where the wind blowsAn' though I couldn't defineI can only tell you that IGot a heavy soulTuesdays dressed in shearlingAnchored on beliefIn the sunlight on the waterOr rain upon a leafAnd I'm touched by its' beautyAnd I hope to touch you too'Cause I still seek the same thingsThat I once sought to be trueAnd you know, that where the wind blowsTho' I wouldn't be lying, when I tell you that IGot a heavy soulIt's a joy to knowI've got a heavy soulWe're words upon a windowWritten there in steamIn the heat of the momentEverything is what it seemsVapors passing nearlySo I'm touched by the thoughtThat I can't be beaten and I can't be boughtAnd you'll know....................That where the wind blowsI don't think I'd be lyin'When I tell you that II've got a heavy soul
