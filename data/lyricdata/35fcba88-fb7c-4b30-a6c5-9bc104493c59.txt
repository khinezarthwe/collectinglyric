Cannons pound into the nightAngels soar into the skyThe battle rages onDeliverance unholy oneThe seeds of hate fly tonightGood and evil light the skyAnother vision from insideI know it's wrong I can't denyFor seven years I have reignedIn this damned and desolate hellNow I've lived the masters vengeanceIt saved me from myselfWe paint the sky with blood tonightSetting free the damned to fightThe whore of Babylon is hereThe end of the storm is nearChorus:Pure evilFeel the pain from the jackals wrathPure evilDance in flames for the final questHear the ghost of violenceFear the God of detrimentThe land on earth is soaked with bloodHear the screams of the helpless onesAxes yield and daggers flyRipping through all flesh in sightWe paint the sky with blood tonightSetting free the damned to fightThe whore of Babylon is hereThe end of the storm is nearRepeat chorus
