Why do you come here?And why..Why do you hang around?I'm so sorryI'm so...Why do you come hereWhen you know it makes things hard for me?When you know.. Oh why do you come?Why do you telephone?And why..Send me silly notes?I'm so sorryI'm so sorryWhy do you come hereWhen you know it makes things hard for me?When you know.. Oh why do you come?You had to sneak into my roomJust to read my diaryIt was just to seeJust to seeAll the things you knewI'd written about youOh so many illustrations, oh butI'm so very sickened, OhI am so sickened NOWIt was a good lay, good lay...
