Because everything good fell down,Along with our dreams that we thought would follow,'cause we were lost,We were lost in steeps and hollows.And all that I knew broke down, bound by the thoughts of constant sorrow,'cause we were gone, we were lost in steeps and hollowsAnd we walked down Gledden arcade, and we feel in love again.We sang and drank in the parade and we felt like, we felt like it would never end.Then came bodies here..Hold you hands out my love,We'll save all the prettiest things until tomorrow.Because everything good fell down,Along with our dreams that we thought would follow,'cause we were lost,We were lost in steeps and hollows.And all that I knew broke down, bound by the thoughts of constant sorrow,'cause we were gone, we were lost in steeps and hollows
