I'm a fortunate son of a fortunate sonLiving large on the wrong side of townToo many friends and the fun never endsDrinking and hanging aroundI wanna rule the world wanna swallow it wholeAt least I could kick it all downI wanna kick it all downEyes wide open I can't seeEyes wide open what you meanEyes wide open I can't seem to beI don't take the bus and I never walk too farThe furthest I got was my own backyardWith a fist full of cash that somebody else earnedSend me some more when it all got burnedI wanna take control wanna make it all mineAt least I could kick it all downI wanna' kick it all downEyes wide open I can't seeEyes wide open what you meanEyes wide open I can't seem to beYou never ever knowI'll get what I want if I make up my mindI'm turning you inside outI wanna rule the world wanna swallow it wholeI think I'll just kick it all downI wanna kick it all downEyes wide open I can't seeEyes wide open what you meanEyes wide open I can't seem to be
