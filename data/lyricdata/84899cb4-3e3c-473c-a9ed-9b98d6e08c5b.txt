You pin the medals to your chestAnd settle down for a seven minutes restYou dim the lights, administer the cureYou tried it several times, you're still not sureYou take the first one for freeAnd pass it on to me, I don't refuseBaby, if you only knewBut I don't think you doYou take the lines from ordinary booksYou're disappointed in the way she looksYou cut the circulation to your handAnd calculate the motion of the landThen you fall back asleepAnd wander down the street that losers useDon't say you feel the same way tooHoney, I don't think you doYou cut the worms and bait them on the hooksYou cast a line towards the closest brooksYou meet the girl who says she knows the planYou act impressed and say you understand'Cause you like to believeThat all that love is free for someone like youYou'll never be lonely or get the bluesBut darlin', it's not true
