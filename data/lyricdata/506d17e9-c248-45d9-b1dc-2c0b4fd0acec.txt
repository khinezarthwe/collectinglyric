My hands are brokenAnd time is going on and on it goes, forever (How long)So I got high and lived all that lifeThat I have taken all for grantedPromise me you'll try to leave it all behind'Cause I've elected hellLying to myselfWhy have I gone blind?Live another lifeYou,You.The only way outIs letting your guard downAnd never die forgotten (I Know)Forgive me my loveI stand here all alone and I can see the bottomPromise me you'll try to leave it all behind'Cause I've elected hellLying to myselfWhy have I gone blind?Live another lifeYou,You,You,You,You,You.
