You were a witch with your short hairThe weather would celebrate us both as we ran all the way homeStaked out in the oaksIn the form of little brothers from down belowThe weather would celebrate us both as we ran all the way homeTumbling down the hillOur faces dirty with warpaintAnd all of Jerusalem is sleeping in our front yardPlease be able only to see the legs in front of usWe went through the carpentryHaving stolen parts of buildingsShouting for you to slap the songs on your kneesAre we as bandits with orange peels over our eyes?You were a witch with your short hairThe weather would celebrate us both as we ran all the way homeTumbling down the hillOur faces dirty with warpaintThese are the tools that take the marrow from your bones
