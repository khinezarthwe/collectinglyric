If you leave, don't leave nowPlease don't take my heart awayPromise me, just one more nightThen we'll go our separate waysWe've always had time on our sideNow it's fading fastEvery second, every momentWe've gotta make it lastI touch you once, I touch you twiceI won't let go at any priceI need you now like I need you thenYou always said we'd still be friends somedayIf you leave I won't cryI won't waste one single dayBut if you leave don't look backI'll be running the other waySeven years went under the bridgeLike time was standing stillHeaven knows what happens nowYou've gotta say you willI'll touch you once, I'll touch you twiceI won't let go at any priceI need you now like I need you thenYou always said we'd meet againI touch you once, I touch you twiceI won't let go at any priceI need you now like I need you thenYou always said we'd still be friendsI touch you once, I touch you twiceI won't let go at any priceI need you now like I need you thenYou always said we'd meet again somedayIf you leaveIf you leaveIf you leaveDon't look backDon't look back
