What I did hereIs in the pastHow could we seeWe'd never lastAnd time will tellAnd you're all eyes (?)And now the truthIs your demiseAll my heartAll of your tearsOur whole worldIs smoke and mirrorsAll my heartAll of your tearsOur whole worldIs smoke and mirrorsYou're here yourself (?)In wandered eyes (?)But now I've seenThrough your disguiseFrom where I standA lovely viewYour world unwindsYou come ungluedAll my heartAll of your tearsOur whole worldIs smoke and mirrorsAll my heartAll of your tearsOur whole worldIs smoke and mirrors
