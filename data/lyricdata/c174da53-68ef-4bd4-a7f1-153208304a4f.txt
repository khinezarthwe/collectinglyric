If I had the chance, loveI would not hesitateTo tell you all the things I never said beforeDon't tell me it's too late'Cause I've relied on my illusionsTo keep me warm at nightBut I denied in my capacity to loveI am willing to give up this fightI've been up all night drinkingTo drown my sorrow downNothing seems to help me since you went awayI'm so tired of this townWhere every tongue is waggingWhen every back is turnedThey're telling secrets that should never be revealedThere's nothing to be gained from thisBut disasterHere's a good oneDid you hear about my friendHe's embarrassed to be seen nowBecause we...all know his sinsIf I had the chance, loveYou know, I would not hesitateTo tell you all the things I never said beforeDon't tell me it's too late'Cause I've relied on my illusionsTo keep me warm at nightBut I denied in my capacity to loveand I am willing to give up this fightOh, I am willing to give up this fight
