If I broke my jaw for you I'd find a bloody tooth and rip it outThrow it in the water where it'd float until the river let it outOut across the flood plane it would float until it reached the open seaUnderneath the sand and silt and in between the smooth stones and seaweedOoh, oohLove is like a space ship burning up when it hits the atmosphereWishing that for once it might have wised up right and stayed away from hereUp in outer space where there's no oxygen and nothing makes a soundMartians build canals to bring the water and to sail their vessels downOoh, ooh
