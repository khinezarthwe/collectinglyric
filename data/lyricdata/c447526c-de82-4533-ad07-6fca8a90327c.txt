I never dreamt it'd be this wayI lost any chance for me to sayTo say that I miss you, say that I love youWill someone please tell me I'm okayI wasn't prepared for what's to comeA life made of memories gone so youngAnd now I'm regretting all I've doneBut in your heart you know that I'm with you all alongWherever you go, I will be waitingWhenever you call, I will be thereWhatever it takes, I'll make your darkest days so brightI'm in your heart tonightI never thought that this could goAnd take me away from all I knowAnd leave me to think I'm on my ownBut your love will take me, you were the one......Who sat through nightsYou held me tightAnd made sure I'm okayAnd I thank you for the love you gave to meWherever you go, I will be waitingWhenever you call, I will be thereWhatever it takes, I'll make your darkest days so brightI'm in your heart tonight...Tonight...Wherever you go, I will be waitingWhenever you call, I will be thereWhatever it takes, I'll make your darkest days so brightWherever you go, I will be waitingWhenever you call, I will be thereWhatever it takes, I'll make your darkest days so brightAnd if I should fall, I know your waitingAnd if I should call, I know your thereIf ever you cry just knowI'm in your heart tonight...I'm in your heart tonight.
