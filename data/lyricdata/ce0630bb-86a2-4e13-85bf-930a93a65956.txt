I thought that we were here by choiceNot tethered by all that we knowSay you won't leave me with a noteA real little tearjerkerI invite you to a gathering of the hopelessly liberated and freeI close my eyes and count to ten it makes no differenceIf I took you back would you go?I'll waitIf I took you back would you go?I'll waitSooner or later we will work this out just like alwaysSooner or later we will work this out just like alwaysThe structures and confines we formed were never meant as a compromiseBut reality and restrictions of time draw the lines of our disfunctionI invite you to a gathering of the sinful, regretful, asleepWe close our eyes count back from tenWe find forgivenessIn time a pattern forms and then is unconnectedWe watch the balance shift from you to back andSiempre, siempreLa eternidad
