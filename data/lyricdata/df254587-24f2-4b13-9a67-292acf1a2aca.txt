There's a wild wind blowingDown the corner of my streetEvery night there the headlights are glowingThere's a cold war comingOn the radio I heardBaby it's a violent worldOh love, don't let me goWon't you take me where the streetlights glowI can hear it comingI can hear the siren soundNow my feet won't touch the groundTime came a-creepingOh and time's a loaded gunEvery road is a ray of lightIt goes o-o-o-onTime'll leak and lead you onStill it's such a beautiful nightOh oh love, don't let me goWon't you take me where the streetlights glowI can hear it comingLike a serenade of soundNow my feet won't touch the groundGravity release meAnd don't ever hold me downNow my feet won't touch the ground
