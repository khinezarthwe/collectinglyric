I spent the winter on the verge of a total breakdown while living in NorwayI felt the darkness of the black metal bandsBut being such fawn of a man I didn't burn down any old churchesJust slept way too much, just sleptMy mind rejects the frequencyIt's static craziness to meIs it a solar fever?The TV man is too loudOur plane is sleeping on a cloudYou turn the dial, I'll try and smileWe've eaten plastic weatherThis family sticks togetherWe will escape from the south to the west sideMy mind rejects the frequencyIt's just verbosity to meI spent the winter with my nose buried in a bookWhile trying to restructure my characterBecause it had become vile to its creatorAnd through many dreadful nightsI lay praying to a saint that nobody has heard ofAnd waiting for some high times to come againMy mind rejects the frequencyIt's static craziness to meIs it a solar fever?The TV man is too loudOur plane is sleeping on a cloudYou turn the dial, I'll try and smileWe've eaten plastic weatherThis family sticks togetherWe will escape from the south to the west sideMy mind rejects the frequencyIt's just verbosity to meDirty old shadow, stay awayDon't play your games with meI am older now, I see the way you operateIf you don't hurt me then you dieMy mind rejects the frequencyIt's static craziness to meIs it a solar fever?The TV man is too loudOur plane is sleeping on a cloudYou turn the dial, I'll try and smileWe've eaten plastic weatherThis family sticks togetherWe will escape from the south to the west sideMy mind rejects the frequencyIt's just verbosity to me
