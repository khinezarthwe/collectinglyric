Where do you go, when you look at what you've said and doneAnd you wonder did I care at all, and you wonder did I care at allHow would you know when it's time to say goodbye and let goAnd you wonder did I help at all, and you wonder did I help at allSo it goes and you're left with everything you ownAnd you wonder did I need it all, did I need it allBut I fall in line, yes I fall in lineJust to find a little hope, just to find a little hopeBut I fall in line, yes I fall in lineJust to find a little hope, just to find a little hopeJust to find a little hope, just to find a little hopeWhere do you turn, when you look beyond your own worldWhen you wonder have I seen it all, when you wonder have I seen it allWhat did you learn, do you wonder is there something moreDo you wonder is there something more, do you wonder is there something moreBut I fall in line, yes I fall in lineJust to find a little hope, just to find a little hopeBut I fall in line, yes I fall in lineJust to find a little hope, just to find a little hopeJust to find a little hope, just to find a little hope etc
