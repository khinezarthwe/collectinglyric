Sirens wake me upWake me upWith a cryThings we doFor attention...Just a littleReminder dearI am still aliveSo confusedI almost threwIt all awayFor youYou took me higherAnd you droppedMe lowerThan i've ever beenBeforeCHORUSIf i have a heart attackAt 23I'm loving you too muchIf i have a heart attackAt 23Wave bye-byeYou'll miss meYou'll miss me babyIf i have a heart attackAt 23All my friendsWe waste soMuch loveOn our menWhy can't iBe forgivingWhile he been outA-messin'With his argentine babyREPEAT CHORUSI must be dreamingWe were togetherIn aLand of scarlet ribbonThat tied you to me darlin'Roll roll roll roll onBut you know i'm neverSatisfiedWith all the good thingsIn my lifeI thought i needed youTo be strongI'll still miss youWhen i'm goneREPEAT CHORUS
