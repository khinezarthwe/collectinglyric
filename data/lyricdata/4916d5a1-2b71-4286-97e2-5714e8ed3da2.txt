Oh, God, it's rainingBut I'm not complainingIt's filling me upWith new lifeThe stars in the skyBring tears to my eyesThey're lighting my wayTonightAnd I haven't felt so aliveIn yearsJust for a dayOn a day like todayI'll get away fromThis constant debaucheryThe wind in my hairMakes me so awareHow good it is to liveTonightAnd I haven't felt so aliveIn yearsThe MoonIs shining in the skyReminding meOf so many other nightsBut they're not like tonightOh, God, it's rainingAnd I'm not containingMy pleasureAt being so wetHere on my ownAll on my ownHow good it feels to be alone tonightAnd I haven't felt so aliveIn yearsThe MoonIs shining in the skyReminding meOf so many other nightsWhen my eyes have been so redI've been mistaken for deadBut not tonight
