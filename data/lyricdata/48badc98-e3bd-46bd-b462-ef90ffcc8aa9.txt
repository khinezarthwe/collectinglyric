In one single moment, your whole life can turn 'roundI stand there for a minute, starin' straight into the groundLookin' to the left slightly, then lookin' back downThe world feels like it's caved in, proper sorry frownPlease let me show you where we could only just be for usI can change, and I can grow, or we could adjustThe wicked thing about us is we always have trustWe can even have an open relationship if you mustI look at her, she stares almost straight back at meBut her eyes glaze over, like she's lookin' straight through meThen her eyes must have closed for what seems an eternityWhen they open up she's lookin' down at her feetDry your eyes mateI know it's hard to take, but her mind has been made upThere's plenty more fish in the seaDry your eyes mateI know you want to make her see how much this pain hurtsBut you've got to walk away now, it's overSo then I move my hand up from down by my sideIt's shaking; my life is crashing before my eyesI turn the palm of my hand up to face the skiesTouch the bottom of her chin and let out a sigh'Cause I can't imagine my life without you and meThere's things I can't imagine doin'Things I can't imagine seein'It weren't supposed to be easy, surelyPlease, please, I'm begging, pleaseShe brings her hands up towards where my hands restedShe wraps her fingers 'round mine with the softness she's blessed withShe peels away my fingers, looks at me and then gesturesBy pushin' my hand away to my chest, from hersDry your eyes mateI know it's hard to take, but her mind has been made upThere's plenty more fish in the seaDry your eyes mateI know you want to make her see how much this pain hurtsBut you've got to walk away now, it's overAnd I'm just standin' thereI can't say a word'Cause everything is just goneI've got nothin'Absolutely nothin'Tryin' to pull her close out of bare desperationPut my arms around her, tryin' to change what she's sayingPull my head level with hers so she might engage inLook in to her eyes to make her listen againI'm not gonna fuckin' just fuckin' leave it all now'Cause you said it'd be forever, and that was your vowAnd you're gonna let our things simply crash and fall downYou're well out of order now, this is well out of townShe pulls away, my arms are tightly clamped round her waistGently pushes me back as she looks at me straightTurns around so she's now got her back to my faceTakes one step forward, looks back and then walks awayDry your eyes mateI know it's hard to take, but her mind has been made upThere's plenty more fish in the seaDry your eyes mateI know you want to make her see how much this pain hurtsBut you've got to walk away now, it's overI know in the past I've found it hard to sayTellin' you things, but not tellin' straightBut the more I pull on your hand and sayThe more you pull awayDry your eyes mateI know it's hard to take, but her mind has been made upThere's plenty more fish in the seaDry your eyes mateI know you want to make her see how much this pain hurtsBut you've got to walk away now
