The way you're bathed in lightReminds me of that nightGod laid me down into your rose garden of trustAnd I was swept awayWith nothin' left to saySome helpless foolYeah I was lost in a swoon of peaceYou're all I need to findSo when the time is rightCome to me sweetly, come to meCome to meLove will lead us, alrightLove will lead us, she will lead usCan you hear the dolphin's cry?See the road rise up to meet usIt's in the air we breathe tonightLove will lead us, she will lead usOh yeah, we meet againIt's like we never leftTime in between was just a dreamDid we leave this place?This crazy fog surrounds meYou wrap your legs around meAll I can do to try and breatheLet me breathe so that ISo we can go together!Love will lead us, alrightLove will lead us, she will lead usCan you hear the dolphin's cry?See the road rise up to meet usIt's in the air we breathe tonightLove will lead us, she will lead usLife is like a shooting starIt don't matter who you areIf you only run for cover, it's just a waste of timeWe are lost 'til we are foundThis phoenix rises up from the groundAnd all these wars are overOverOverSingin' la da da, da da daOverCome to meCome to me yeah la da da da, da da daCome to me
