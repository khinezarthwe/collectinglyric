My girlfriend, my dumb donutWent up to a party just the other nightBut three hours later and seven shots of JaegerShe was in the bedroom with another guyAnd I don't really wanna knowSo don't tell me anymoreAnd I really don't  wanna hearAbout your feet all up in the airAnd well I'm not the one who acted like a hoeWhy must I be the one who has to know?I'm not the one who messed up big timeSo spare me the details if you don't mindNow I can understand friends who wanna tell meThey think they're gonna help me, open up my eyesBut the play by play makes me wanna lose itEverytime you do it man, it turns the knifeAnd I don't really wanna knowSo don't tell me anymoreAnd I really don't wanna hearAbout your feet all up in the airAnd well I'm not the one who acted like a hoeWhy must I be the one who has to know?I'm not the one who messed up big timeSo spare me the details if you don't mindNow I don't need to hear about the sounds they were makin'And I don't need to hear about how long it was takin'Or how the walls, they were shakin'Now lying in bed, wallowing in sorrowMissin' the tomorrow that we could have hadRunning through my head, over and overThings I never told her that just made me sadAnd it drives me insane sittin' with a visionStuck with that image burned into my brainAnd it feels so dumb that I could ever trust herWhen someone else fucked her, then walked awayAnd I don't really wanna knowSo don't tell me anymoreAnd I really don't wanna hearAbout her feet all up in the airAnd so I'm not the one who acted like a hoeWhy must I be the one who has to know?I'm not the one who messed up big timeSo spare me the details if you don't mind'Cause I don't wanna knowDon't wanna know(Spare me the details if you don't mind)Don't wanna know(Spare me the details if you don't mind)Don't wanna know...
