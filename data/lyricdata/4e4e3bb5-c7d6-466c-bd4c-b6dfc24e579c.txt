Kill for gain or shoot to maimBut we don't need a reasonThe Golden Goose is on the looseAnd never out of seasonBlackened pride still burns inside this shell of bloody treasonHere's my gun for a barrel of fun for the love of living deathThe killer's breed or the demon's seedThe glamour, the fortune, the painGo to war again, blood is freedom's stainDon't you pray for my soul anymore2 minutes to midnightThe hands that threaten doom2 minutes to midnightTo kill the unborn in the wombThe blind men shout "Let the creatures out!We'll show the unbelieversThe napalm screams of human flamesOf a prime-time Belsen feast... yeah!"As the reasons for the carnage cut their meat and lick the gravyWe oil the jaws of the war machine and feed it with our babiesThe killer's breed or the demon's seedThe glamour, the fortune, the painGo to war again, blood is freedom's stainDon't you pray for my soul anymore2 minutes to midnightThe hands that threaten doom2 minutes to midnightTo kill the unborn in the wombThe body bags and little rags of children torn in twoAnd the jellied brains of those who remain to put the finger right on youAs the madmen play on words and make us all dance to their songTo the tune of starving millions to make a better kind of gunThe killer's breed or the demon's seedThe glamour, the fortune, the painGo to war again, blood is freedom's stainDon't you pray for my soul anymore2 minutes to midnightThe hands that threaten doom2 minutes to midnightTo kill the unborn in the wombMidnight is all nightMidnight all night!
