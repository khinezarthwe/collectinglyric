I see him all the time, every night and every dayI know we're doing fine he calls me, I'm on my wayWe never sit around we just go outside insteadHe steals my thunder while I pick the flowers in his headAll the time, all the time, all the time, all the timeWe go commit a crime, I see him all the timeAll the time, all the time, all the time, all the timeWe go commit a crime, I see him all the timeI see him all the time, every minute, every hourOur love is like a lime, sometimes sweet but mostly sourWe never fool around, we just walk and talk insteadHe steals my thunder while I pick the flowers in his headAll the time, all the time, all the time, all the timeWe go commit a crime, we never wait in lineBut he always looks so fine, I see him all the timeAll the time, all the time, all the time, all the time
