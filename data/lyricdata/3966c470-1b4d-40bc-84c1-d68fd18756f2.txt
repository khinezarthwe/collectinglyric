In the cold, coldest of nightsThe fire I light, to warm my bonesOh love, had enough, of the dreadful coldAnd from the flames, appears SalomeI stand before her amazedAs she dances and demandsThe head of john the baptist on a plateIn the morning, shaken and disturbedFrom under soft white furI see the dust in the morning bright sets the room aliveAnd by the telly appears SalomeI stand before her amazedAs she dances and demandsThe head of Isidora Duncan on a plateOh, It's SalomeOh, It's Salome
