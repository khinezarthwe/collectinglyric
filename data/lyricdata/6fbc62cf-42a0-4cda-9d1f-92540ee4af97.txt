The cup is not half empty as pessimists sayAs far as he sees nothing's left in the cupA whole cup full of nothing for him to indulgeSince the voice of ambition has long since been shut upA singer, a writer, he's not dreaming now of going nowhereHe gave heed to nothing, and all that he was...Is just a tragedySo he voyages in circlesSucceeds getting nowhereAnd submits to the substanceThat first got him there, there, there, thereThen in violent, frustration he cries out to God or just no oneIs there a point to this madness and all that he was...Is just a tragedyHe feels aloneHis heart in his handHe's aloneHe feels aloneI feel...Then on that last day he breaksAnd he stood tallAnd he yelledAnd he yelledWhy(And he takes his life)Then in violent, frustration he cries out to God or just no oneIs there a point to this madness and all that he was...Is just a tragedy
