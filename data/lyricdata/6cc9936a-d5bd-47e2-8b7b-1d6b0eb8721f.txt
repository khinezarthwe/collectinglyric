Can these be my handsWhy won't they follow my commandsSomeone took my breath from meI can't see and i can't speakI had a dream you were a snakeI guess this proves i knew you wellI had a dream when i was falling downUntil i landed under youGo to hell and leave me withThe keys to your carDelia will drive me through the rainAnd it's just like you to pick the perfect timeWhen i'm already down and thereTo kick a couple timesYou took everything i saidAnd everything i didAnd everything i though was mineI feel like such a foolFor having turned to youI didn't know that you could ever wantTo be so cruelAnd if there is a god, and if god is fairI know you will suffer (delia)
