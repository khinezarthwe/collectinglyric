Climbing out of the sky a man who could flyAnd a painting anyone could playIt's a comic book crush that taught you to trustStaring out of the stands at a rock n' roll bandAnd a hero no one else could saveIt was never much but it's all that you gaveAnd I wonder if you wonder, or did your stars finally explode?Did the thunder pull you underneath the haze?I'm amazed, than I let goLittle minds let little games burn big old dreams with little flamesAnd you don't think I understandLittle holes in parachutes won't leave you fallingIf they do, it's because you want to landClimbing out of his chair to fix the T.V. glare is a manBut no one knows he's thereIt's a Dramamine dream that kept them alive but lostShe's got her plastic friends and a brand new Benz and she laughsHell, sometimes life ain't fairIt's a comic book crush that got them nowhereAnd I wonder if you wonder, or did your stars finally explode?Did the thunder pull you underneath the haze?I'm amazed, than I let goLittle minds let little games burn big old dreams with little flamesAnd you don't think I understandLittle holes in parachutes won't leave you fallingIf they do, it's because you want to landThese elevator doors are closing again you leave before I plannedI taste you walking down the hallYou left your perfume on the nightstand
