Our last summer as independents? (4x)Do you remember (Do you remember?)I was a foreigner when you appearedFrom the shadows at the Mono clubI was a hater in the depths of an emotional hibernationYou sat me down, we had some drinksAnd you told me all kinds of insanityI asked your friend if you were availableShe answered, 'no, but yes, oh well oh well, yes and no,'Now, I'm viewing my memory reel in reverseScrolling back to come to feel your weather thenNow, I'm noting the limits of our parabolaTo predict the points of thou-shalt-not-returnThis inbreeding of ideas is intolerableI wish David was hereI can't take your persecution complex andI'm not gonna absorb your stress output any moreOh don't you pimp out my heartDon't you pimp out my heart>
