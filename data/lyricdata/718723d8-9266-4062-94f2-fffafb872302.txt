HiScars will heal soonThe dregs in us spent the Earth downBetter than drowning in a burlap sackI live. As Alice. I die.Children shouldn't play with dead thingsFoaming crowsTear at their wingsSad eyes cry crimson bloodDrop it it's deadWheels won't turn they won't turn the birdy's headSad eyes sad eyes like sharpened daggersYou'll never walk only staggerSad eyes quite crypticBye
