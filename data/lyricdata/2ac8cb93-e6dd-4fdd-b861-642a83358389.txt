I hope you never lose your sense of wonderYou get your fill to eat but always keep that hungerMay you never take one single breath for grantedGod forbid love ever leave you empty handedI hope you still feel small when you stand beside the oceanWhenever one door closes I hope one more opensPromise me that you'll give faith a fighting chanceAnd when you get the choice to sit it out or danceI hope you dance....I hope you dance..........I hope you never fear those mountains in the distanceNever settle for the path of least resistanceLivin' might mean takin' chances, but they're worth takin'Lovin' might be a mistake, but it's worth makin'Don't let some Hell bent heart leave you bitterWhen you come close to sellin' out reconsiderGive the heavens above more than just a passing glanceAnd when you get the choice to sit it out or danceI hope you dance....I hope you danceI hope you dance....I hope you dance(Time is a wheel in constant motion always rolling us alongTell me who wants to look back on their yearsand wonder where those years have gone)I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean,Whenever one door closes I hope one more opens,Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance,And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance.Dance....I hope you dance.I hope you dance....I hope you dance.I hope you dance....I hope you dance..(Time is a wheel in constant motion always rolling us along,Tell me who wants to look back on their yearsand wonder where those years have gone.)
