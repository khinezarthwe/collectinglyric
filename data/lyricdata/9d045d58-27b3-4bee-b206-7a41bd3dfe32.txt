Night kills dayAnd I'm watching the sun dieLiving moon taking up the whole skyLive moon don't care about a dead sunLuna's begunDarkness might never come to endDeathly light marks the scene of the crimeMaking night's murder harder to bearBewareThe moon drives the seas insaneSoon the tide will take you inWhy you, why bother to explainSee the lunatic hanging in the skyHis confession carried by the windLies and says the sun will rise againYou and I know differentDarkness might never come to endDeathly light marks the scene of the crimeMaking night's murder harder to bearTake careThe moon drives the seas insaneSoon the tide will take you inWhy you, why bother to explainThe moon drives the seas insaneSoon the tide will take you inWhy you, why bother to explain
