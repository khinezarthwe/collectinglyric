This was a triumphI'm making a note here, huge successIt's hard to overstate my satisfactionAperture ScienceWe do what we must because we canFor the good of all of usExcept the ones who are deadBut there's no sense crying over every mistakeYou just keep on trying 'til you run out of cakeAnd the science gets doneAnd you make a neat gunFor the people who are still aliveI'm not even angryI'm being so sincere right nowEven though you broke my heart and killed meAnd tore me to piecesAnd threw every piece into a fireAs they burned it hurt becauseI was so happy for youNow these points of data make a beautiful lineAnd we're out of beta, we're releasing on timeSo I'm glad I got burned, think of all the things we learnedFor the people who are still aliveGo ahead and leave meI think I prefer to stay insideMaybe you'll find someone else to help youMaybe Black MesaThat was a joke, ha ha, fat chanceAnyway this cake is greatIt's so delicious and moistLook at me still talking when there's science to doWhen I look out there it makes me glad I'm not youI've experiments to run, there is research to be doneOn the people who are still aliveAnd believe me, I am still aliveI'm doing science, and I'm still aliveI feel fantastic, and I'm still aliveWhile you're dying, I'll be still aliveAnd when you're dead, I'll be still aliveStill aliveStill alive
