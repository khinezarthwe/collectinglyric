I'll meet you in West GermanyOctober 1983I know the freedom was a lieand you husband was a spyYou say that words are impotentBut they can help us pay the rentI knew for sure there was nothing leftExcept the vodka on your breathWe meet in StrasbourgIn StrasbourgDann sind wir HeldenWe meet in StrasbourgThe courage that your father pluckedFrom inside a cattle truckWill help us fix the exit pollsOur children must have rock'n'rollSurveillance cameras captured dawnBreaking on the autobahnI knew for sure our chance was blownWhen rifles made you feel at homeWe meet in StrasbourgIn StrasbourgDann sind wir HeldenWe meet in StrasbourgWe meet in StrasbourgIn StrasbourgDann sind wir HeldenWe meet in StrasbourgEins, zwei, drei, vierDeas can change the governmentBut they never listen to our argumentsOn TV our friends smashed cementAnd pulled down the bastards monumentsI went outside for a cigaretteI could see things I had tried to forgetThe news showed us who we had leftAnd I could smell the vodka on your breath
