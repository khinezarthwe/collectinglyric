There's a town, just a little townRaining cloud, a hollow soundWhen our lover gather roundAnd if they're coldThen they're coldFeed them wine, feed them chromeWe hate this place hereIt's our home, It's our homeAnd your car-collapsing trees and ICould turn them back to soundWith the torches in our hands we will reduce itTo the groundI stood outside in the bright black nightBeneath their buzzing power linesAnd I saw a number in the sky, in the skyAnd if there's a God, he's a little gunAnd he holds you closely inside these wallsBut he hates his babies most of allAnd your car-collapsing trees and ICould turn them back to soundWith our torches in our hands we will reduce it to the groundIn the parliament there's a littleHands that are reaching outYou can try and try and try but baby there's no way aroundSing CaptainSing out loudSing, but we're boundBoundSing CaptainSing out loudSing CaptainWe're Bound
