This is a warwe liveand the sides are drawnsides are drawn.We're all wrapped up in fatiguesand they wear us out.wear us outThere is a storm at sea.If we fly a white flagunder a black and blue sky,will the red sun rise?(The taste of your kerosene lips burn me up)If we fly a white flagunder a black and blue sky,will the red sun rise?(The glare from your enemy sights make me go blind.)Blinds divide the sunlight into thin strips, the size of a blade,in this trench that we dig for ourselves, fourscore and fade.Glare with the enemy heat of the bodies in the bed.There's no retreat.This is a warwe live in.Now we're up in armsup in armswith our heads pressed against the wallAnd it's wearing thinAnd it's wearing thinThese are the screamswe swallow.If we fly a white flagunder a black and blue sky,will the red sun rise?(The taste of your kerosene lips burn me up)If we fly a white flagunder a black and blue sky,will the red sun rise?(The glare from your enemy sights make me go blind.)this is our war.Administer the pill before the cell divides(Keep marching--keep fighting)and we'll both go down like toy soldiers. Threats and picketslines are forming around our beds and the landminesin our chests will all go off in time. If we trip each otherinto this, do you think we'll find a way out?We've synthesized a compound to treat this conscienceIt's: one part loss, one part no sleep, one part gunshot we heard,one part the screams mistaken for laughter,one part everything after, one part love,one part stepping out of the driving rain,one part parting ways,in the cold apartment. Don't look back, just keep onrunning down the stairs. Do you hear the footsteps?Can you hear the voices in the traffic, communiquesin the attic? They say, after time, all this will heal,we will rebuild and these broken armswill mend themselves in our embrace
