I'm all over my heart's desireI feel cold but I'm back in the fireOut of control but I'm tied up tightCome in, come out tonightI'm comin' up in the early morningI feel love in the shock of the lightningI fall into the blinding lightCome in, come out, come in, come out tonightLove is a time machineUp on the silver screenIt's all in my mindLove is a litanyA magical mysteryAnd all in good timeAnd all in good timeAnd all in good timeI got my feet on the street but I can't stop flyingMy head's in the clouds but at least I'm tryingI'm out of control but I'm tied up tightCome in, come out tonightThere's a hole in the ground into which I'm fallingSo God speed to the sound of the poundingI'm all into the blinding lightCome in, come out, come in, come out tonightLove is a time machineUp on the silver screenIt's all in my mindLove is a litanyA magical mysteryAnd all in good timeAnd all in good timeAnd all in good timeIt's all in my mindLove is a time machineUp on the silver screenAnd all in good timeAnd all in good timeAnd all in good time
