Save me with a fallSave me from the sick womanLet her speakNo you said allTill we meet the splinteringI dreamed a dream I thought I knewI drew a line that came a blueMy legs are stints so I can't goTo where I think my heart put youAnd we're floatingRiding the hill sideInto tomorrowOh Maddie don't let me downOff a mountainWhat an arrivalInto tomorrowOh Maddie don't let me downI believe in what you reap you sowSo what goes around comes aroundSo what goes around will come back aroundI believe in what you reap you sowSo what goes around comes aroundSo what goes around, I will come back aroundSo long as I'm aroundAnd we're floatingRiding the hill sideInto tomorrowOh Maddie don't let me downOff a mountainWhat an arrivalInto tomorrowOh Maddie the splinteringAnd we're floatingOff of the hill sideInto tomorrowOh Maddie don't let me downOff a mountainWhat an arrivalInto tomorrowOh Maddie don't let me down
