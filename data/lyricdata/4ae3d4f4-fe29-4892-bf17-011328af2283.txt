I haven't seen you in agesBut it's not as bleak as it seemsThe tears have stained all the pagesIt is all a romance to beSince you've been gone, I've fadedBut I reach out and you go forthMy ears have gone in phasesIt is all a romance to meRomance to meRomance I seeThere's a joy in my eyes, I can't denyBut only to those who knows meReplaced by the sadness and longingIs the romance you'd given to meI still hear the bells when I walkBut the movie has changed its keyI'm touched by your breath as I sleepIt is all a romance to meRomance to meRomance I seeRomance to meRomance I see
