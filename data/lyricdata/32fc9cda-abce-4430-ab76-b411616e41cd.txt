Sin in my heartSin in my heart...Sin in my heart flying like a dartOh sin in my heartIt's beginning to start...When you're lying like a tartOh sin in my heartWhen you grovel at my feetOh sin in my heartIt's short and sweetSin in my heart...Swift as a dart sin in my heartOh sin in my heartWhen you grovel at my feetKeep it short and sweetSin in my heart...
