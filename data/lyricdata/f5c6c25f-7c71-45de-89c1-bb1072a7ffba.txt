And when I wake up in the morningTo feel the daybreak on my faceThere's a blood that's flowing through the feelingWith a knife to open up the sky's veinsSome things will never changeYou just stand there looking backwards half unconscious from the painIt may seem rearrangedIn the backwater swirling there is something that will never changeAnd when I should have been done a long timeLaughs and says I'll find waysJust when we shelter under paperThe rockets come at us sidewaysSome things will never changeYou just stand there looking backwards half unconscious from the painIt may seem rearrangedIn the backwater swirling there is something that will never changeIt may implyGood vibesFlow from timeOh loosed onAnd when I wake up in the morningTo feel the daybreak on my faceThere's a blood that's flowing through the ceilingWith a knife to open up the sky's veinsSome things will never changeYou just stand there looking backwards half unconscious from the painIt may seem rearrangedIn the backwater swirling there is something that will never changeSome things will never changeYou just stand there looking backwards half unconscious from the painIt may seem rearrangedIn the backwater swirling there is something that will never change
