In the cold of the full moonOn this nightTime itself has sliped awayNow you are mineSlowly the hours passedAll through the nightTogether we can disappearFor a whileI am stillI am stillWatching the hourglassOn that nightWe touched the starsAnd reached the moonFor a timeI'm lost in a moment with youIt feels rightWe're floating above the starsYou and II am stillI am stillForever and ever and everEndlessEndlessNow I am stillEndlessEndlessYour body is endlessI am stillI am stillI am stillI am still
