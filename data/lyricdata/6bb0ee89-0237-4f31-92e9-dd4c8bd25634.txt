There's too many voices living in my headWhen I go to sleep at night they stay awake insteadThey make me take a walk in the middle of the nightAnd I slice people, dice people on my midnight flightI don't want to do itBut they make me do itPlease don't put me through itMy midnight flightI wake up in the morning, and I think it's just a dreamBut then I see the bodies on my tiny TV screenI put my plastic clothing in my washing machineAnd it cleanses my senses of the horrors that they've seenSomething isn't normalBut I can't describe normalPlease don't make me normalMake me obsceneI don't grow, but the death toll doesI wonder why we do it, but the answer's just 'because'Last night I ate the heart of a girl of age just twoAnd when her mother found her, you should've heard her cooOh my little babyKilled by someone crazyLet's hope it's just a phaseHe's going throughCause I'm not understandingI can't forsee the endingThere's no use pretendingThe sky is blueLa la la, la la la do do doDo do do oh oh oh, oh oh oh
