I hope I never wake upI dream about you all the time nowAnd I don't wanna faceAnother night without you hereSomeday, someway, somehowWe will be together againYou know I've always wantedJust to feel the touch of your loveYou know I've always hatedKnowing how far apart we areSomeday, someway, somehowWe will be together againI just want you to know[CHORUS:]Baby I'm all messed up in youYou're far awayBut you're here with meBaby I'm all messed up in youYou're all I needMy everythingEvery night i wake upHoping that I'll find you here andThere's not a day that goes byI don't think about your smileSomeday, someway, somehowWe will be together againI just want you to know[CHORUS]And I know that we will find a wayTo be together somedayAnd I promise you that I won't leaveI'll be here forever[CHORUS]I want youI need youI'm lost here without youI'm all messed up in youI hope i never wake upI dream about you all the time now.
