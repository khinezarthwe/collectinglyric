In a purple visionMany thousand years agoI saw the silent strangerWalk the earth aloneTwenty-seven facesWith their eyes turned to the skyI've got a cameraAnd an airtight alibiI know they're out thereWe see them comingFaster than the speed of lightThey greet us in the dead of the nightSomewhere, someday, someoneThey'll be light and soundThey'll alight on the groundOn which we standSomewhere, someday, someoneWill help us to surviveThey're gonna show us hellAnd bring us back aliveWell, I'm no poet, but I can't be fooledThe lies don't count, the whispers doI hear the whispers on the windThey say the earth has fallen dueWe run in circlesOur days are numberedEvery night I look awayTo the heavens and I prayCome to usCome to usOur lights are dimOur roads are crumblingAnd we don't know what to doWe're sick and tiredAnd dying to meet you'Cause we bit off more thanWe can chew
