I wish I could have loved you moreI wish I could have loved you moreAnd ever since that dayI had to say goodbyeHow I've longed to change my mindBut I know It won't be rightAnd in so many waysYou were made to be my manWhy I had to make you cryI hope you understandI wish I could have loved you moreI wish I could have loved you moreAnd ever since that dayI had to say goodbyeHow I've longed to change my mindBut I know It won't be rightAnd ever since that dayI had to say goodbyeI wish I could have loved you moreI wish I could have loved you more
