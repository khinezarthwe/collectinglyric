I've been thinking 'bout our fortuneAnd I've decided that we're really not to blameFor the love that's deep inside us nowIs still the sameAnd the sound we make togetherIs the music to the story in your eyesIt's been shining down upon me nowI realizeListen to the tide slowly turningWash all our heartaches awayWe're part of the fire that is burningAnd from the ashes we can build another dayBut I'm frightened for your childrenThat the life that we are living is in vainAnd the sunshine we've been waiting forWill turn to rainListen to the tide slowly turningWash all our heartaches awayWe're part of the fire that is burningAnd from the ashes we can build another dayBut I'm frightened for your childrenThat the life that we are living is in vainAnd the sunshine we've been waiting forWill turn to rainWhen the final line is overAnd it's certain that the curtain's gonna fallI can hide inside your sweet, sweet loveForevermore
