Impossible, raw womenI know you're all too hard to pleaseI can help youIf you only ask me kindlyDon't make me get down on my kneesGod bless these hungry womenImpossible to ever keepYour breath has never tasted as sweetI don't need you to need me, to need my freedomMy freedom is a vision you seekAnd the place you disappear to is a placeI wish to beI beg you, instill youDon't treat it like some kind of jokeThis song is, kind lady, my only hopeYou can't kill an idea 'cos it's rainingKeep it in the family, keep it in the kidsYou know, they're all handing out free ticketsThis big, old boat is-a-startin' to sinkThe whole world is getting hungryAnd it ain't memories you need from meAnd if memories are all you need from meYou're a hard act to pleaseShe will fool youDestroy youDisappearWithout so much as a smokeThis song is, cool lady, my only hope
