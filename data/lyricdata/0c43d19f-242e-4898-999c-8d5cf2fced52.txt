I wake up every eveningWith a big smile on my faceAnd it never feels out of placeAnd you're still probably workin'At a 9 to 5 paceI wonder how bad that tastesWhen you see my face hope it gives you hellHope it gives you hellWhen you walk my way hope it gives you hellHope it gives you hellNow where's your picket fence love?And where's that shiny car?It didn't ever get you farAnd you never seemed so tense, loveI've never seen you fall so hardDo you know where you are?And the truth be told I miss youAnd the truth be told I'm lyin'When you see my face hope it gives you hellHope it gives you hellWhen you walk my way hope it gives you hellHope it gives you hellIf you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you wellThen he's a fool, you're just as wellHope it gives you hellI hope it gives you hellTommorow you'll be thinking to yourself:"Where did I go wrong?"But the list goes on and onBut the truth be told I miss youAnd the truth be told I'm lyin'When you see my face hope it gives you hellHope it gives you hellWhen you walk my way hope it gives you hellHope it gives you hellWhen you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you wellThen he's a fool, you're just as wellHope it gives you hellNow, you'll never see what you've done to meYou can take back your memories, they're no good to meAnd here's all your lies, you can look me in the eyesWith the sad, sad look that you wear so well(When you see my face hope it gives you hellHope it gives you hellWhen you walk my way hope it gives you hellHope it gives you hell)(When you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you wellThen he's a fool, you're just as wellHope it gives you hell)When you see my face hope it gives you hellHope it gives you hell (Hope it gives you hell)When you walk my way hope it gives you hellHope it gives you hell (Hope it gives you hell)When you hear this song and you sing alongBut you never tell (No, never tell)Then you're the fool, I just as wellHope it gives you hell (Hope it gives you hell)When you hear this song I hope that it will give you hell (It will give you hell)When you sing along, I hope that it puts you through hell
