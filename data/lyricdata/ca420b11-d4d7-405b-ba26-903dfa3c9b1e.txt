No more promises.I have made them before and broken them.Give me the go-aheadand I'll undress myself for you, if you're at all interested.Now I'm growing legs,I'm the spider, I'm the spider.I'm growing legs,I'm the spider, I'm the spider.Crawl inside her.. I'm the hey!Oh I know your pain.You, like I, plagued by the flies inside your brain.I'm creeping up your veins.Are you smart enough and small enough to play this game?I'm growing legs,I'm the spider, I'm the spider.I'm growing legs,I'm the spider, I'm the spider.Crawl inside her.  I'm the whoaaaI better watch my back around you.You've got the moves the shoes, the 'do-you've got meand I want you to know I want to.You've got those tired eyes all the time,You've got those tired eyes all the time,You've got those tired eyes all the time,Yeah you need someone to bring you to bed.Now I'm growing legs,I'm the spider, I'm the spider.I'm growing legs,I'm the spider, I'm the spider.I am cold, too cool to call you,far too stoned to leave my bed.I'll write this song to win your kissbut stay asleep instead.
