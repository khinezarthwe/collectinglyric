I got the call today, I didn't wanna hearBut I knew that it would comeAn old true friend of ours was talkin' on the phoneShe said you found someoneAnd I thought of all the bad luck,And all the struggles we went throughHow I lost me and you lost youWhat are these voices outside love's open doorMake us throw off our contentmentAnd beg for something more?I've been learning to live without you nowBut I miss you sometimesThe more I know, the less I understandAll the things I thought I knew, I'm learning them againI've been tryin' to get down to the Heart of the MatterBut my will gets weakAnd my thoughts seem to scatterBut I think it's about forgivenessForgivenessEven if, even if you don't love me anymoreThese times are so uncertainThere's a yearning undefinedAnd people filled with rageWe all need a little tendernessHow can love survive in such a graceless ageAnd the trust and self-assurance that lead to happinessThey're the very things we kill, I guessPride and competition cannot fill these empty armsAnd the work they put between us,You know it doesn't keep us warmI've been trying to live without you nowBut I miss you, babyThe more I know, the less I understandAnd all the things I thought I figured out, I have to learn againI've been tryin' to get down to the Heart of the MatterBut my will gets weakAnd my heart is so shatteredBut I think it's about forgivenessForgivenessEven if, even if you don't love me anymoreAll the people in your life who've come and goneThey let you down, you know they hurt your prideBetter put it all behind you; cause life goes onYou keep carrin' that anger, it'll eat you up insideI wanna be happily everafterAnd my heart is so shatteredBut I know it's about forgivenessForgivenessEven if, even if you don't love meI've been tryin' to get down to the Heart of the MatterBecause the flesh gets weakAnd the ashes will scatterSo I'm thinkin' about forgivenessForgivenessEven if you don't love me anymoreEven if you don't love me anymore
