Do you have the time to listen to me whineAbout nothin' and everything all at once?I am one of those melodramatic foolsNeurotic to the bone, no doubt about itSometimes I give myself the creepsSometimes my mind plays tricks on meIt all keeps addin' up, I think I'm crackin' upAm I just paranoid, am I just stoned?I went to a shrink to analyze my dreamsShe says it's lack of sex that's bringin' me downI went to a whore, he said my life's a boreSo quit my whining 'cause it's bringin' her downSometimes I give myself the creepsSometimes my mind plays tricks on meIt all keeps addin' up, I think I'm crackin' upAm I just paranoid? Ah, ya, ya, yaGo, goGrasping to controlSo I better hold onSometimes I give myself the creepsSometimes my mind plays tricks on meIt all keeps addin' up, I think I'm crackin' upAm I just paranoid, am I just stoned?
