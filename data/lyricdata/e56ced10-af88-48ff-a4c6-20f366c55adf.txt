Ooh, ohLive another dayClimb a little higherFind another reason to stayAshes in your handsMercy in your eyesIf you're searching for a silent skyYou won't find it hereLook another wayYou won't find it hereSo die another dayThe coldness of his wordsThe message in his silence,This distance in my voiceIsn't leaving you a choiceSo if you're looking for a time to run awayYou won't find it hereLook another wayYou won't find it thereSo try another dayThey took pictures of our dreamsRan to hide behind the stairsAnd said maybe when it's right for you, they'll fallBut if they don't come downResist the need to pull them inAnd throw them awayBetter to save the mysteryThan surrender to the secretYou won't find it hereLook another wayYou won't find it hereSo try another day
