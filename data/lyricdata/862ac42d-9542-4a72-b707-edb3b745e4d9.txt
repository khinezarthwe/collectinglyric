You were born inside of a raindropAnd I watched you falling to your deathAnd the sun, well, she could not save youShe'd fallen down to, now the streets are wetBody of water, toxic and timelessAtlantic ocean, New York skylineI always get lost when I leave the villageSo I couldn't come meet you in Brooklyn last nightBut I sing glory from my lowestAnd I will say peace to the people I meetWhile the world waits for an explosionThat instant of light that wipes the slate cleanSo don't be fooledNo, don't get lied toLove was always cruelAnd don't act strange, don't be a strangerIt happened to me; now it's happening to youBut if you take that train under waterThen we could talk it throughWell, if I could tame all of my desiresWait out the weather that howls in my brainBecause it seems that it's always changingThe wind's indecision, the sorrowful rainYeah, I was a postcard, I was a recordI was a camera until I went blindAnd now I'm riding, all over this islandLooking for something to open my eyesBut I still sing glory from a high-riseAnd I will say thanks if you're pouring my drinksWhile the world waits for an explosion:That moment in time when we'll be set freeSo don't stay mad, just let some time passAnd in the morning you'll awake feeling newAnd if I don't come backI mean, if I get sidetrackedIt's only 'cause I wanted toI'm keeping up with the moon on an all-night avenueGoddamnYou make me cry
