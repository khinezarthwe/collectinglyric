All the tales you've been tellin' from the startSaid 'em loud but I never believed 'emI wore an old band of black around my heartI wore it proud but it never relieved meSuddenly I got everything I wantYeah once again we can see the big pictureIts gonna take all the good in all of usTo tear away all the damage you did here.And I recall, if I rememberThe scent of eucalyptus oilIts like a dreamBut I remember it wellWe'll send you off in a rotten leaky boatWith all the lies you could never deliverYou'll float away and we'll never forgetWe'll never trust and we'll never forgive ya.And I recall, if I rememberThe scent of eucalyptus oilIts like a dreamBut I remember it wellThe saddest times and the worst times suited you well. x4The dispossessed and the poor times suited you well. x2Yeah all the pain and the hard times suited you well.Yeah all the fear and the hate crimes suited you well.The overboard and the downtrodden suited you well.The dispossessed and the poor times suited you well.The devastated and the foul-mouthed suited you well.The saddest times and the worst time suited you well.The saddest!
