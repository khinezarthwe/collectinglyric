Blood spills from unsealed wounds, baleful afflictions devolved from you,The ones I love (I love), ripped from this world so young,The ones I love, they are walking corpses.I will not shed one more tear for you, and these sutures have yet to bind my flesh,I'll burn this idol in effigy of you,My prayers bemoan a love untrue.Know this, I've lost all compassion, shes cursed by her brooding,May I mar you father?As to cut through your mask of benevolence, and reveal your vile burden,I'll make you live with it, you live with this.And I will not shed one more tear for you, these sutures have yet to bind my flesh,I'll burn this idol in effigy of you,My prayers bemoan a love untrueYou took from me, the ones I live for, the ones I'd die for (condemned so young).You took from me, the ones I live for, the ones I'd kill for (condemned so young).Dream not of me.Let my words haunt you.Copulate with your self loathing.I WILL WATCH YOU BURN, I WILL WATCH YOU...BURN.
