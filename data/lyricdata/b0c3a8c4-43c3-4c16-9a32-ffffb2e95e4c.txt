And I was a boy from schoolHelplessly helping all the rulesAnd there was a boy at schoolHopelessly wrestling all his foolsAnd there was a girl at schoolBlending all the words she learned from homeNothing could keep her a childLong hours, don't you know we triedWe tried, but we didn't have longWe tried, but we don't belongWe tried, but we didn't have longWe tried, but we don't belongNow I met you on the streetHeartlessly breaking rules we meetLives are found but loves are lostSay goodbye to nothing everything causedNow I find you on the streetBreaking rules hopelessly we meetLives are found but loves are lostSay goodbye to everything nothing causedWe tried, but we didn't have longWe tried, but we don't belongWe tried, but we didn't have longWe tried, but we don't belongI got, I got lostYou said this was the way backI got, I got lostYou said this was the way backI got, I got lostYou said this was the way backWe tried, but we didn't have longWe tried, but we don't belongWe tried, but we didn't have longWe tried, but we don't belong
