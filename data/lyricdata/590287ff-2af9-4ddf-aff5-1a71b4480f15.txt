All the small boats on the water aren't going anywhereSurely they must be loaded with more than simple matterFloating on top and gracefully tending to the same poleAll the small boats on the water going nowhereIs it true that none of them, will ever break free and sail?Feel the night is made of rocks the stagnant massIs it true that none of them, will ever break free and sail?Break free from the stagnant boats left in obscurity, left in obscurityAll the faces with their eyes closed giving a smile weightlessLike a body that would vacate to it's own lightIs it true that none of these contented happy facesWill not ever hear a cry, won't hear a cry?Is it true that none of these contented happy facesWill not ever hear a cry, filled with love not with desire, love not desire?All the small boats on the water aren't going anywhereSurely they must be loaded with more than simple matterFloating on top and gracefully tending to the same poleAll the small boats on the water going nowhereIs it true that none of them, will ever break free and sail?Break free from the stagnant boats left in obscurity...
