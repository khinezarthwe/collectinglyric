Well I held you like a loverHappy hands and your elbow in the appropriate placeAnd we ignored our others, happy plansFor that delicate look upon your faceOur bodies moved and hardenedHurting parts of your gardenWith no room for a pardonIn a place where no one knows what we have doneDo you comeTogether ever with him?And is he dark enough?Enough to see your light?And do you brush your teeth before you kiss?Do you miss my smell?Is he bold enough to take you on?Do you feel like you belong?Does he drive you wild?Or just mildly free?What about me?Well you held me like a loverSweaty hands and my foot in the appropriate placeAnd we use cushions to coverHappy glands in the mild issue of our disgraceOur minds pressed and guardedWhile our flesh disregardedThe lack of space for the light-heartedIn the boom that beats our drumWell I know I make you cryAnd I know sometimes you wanna dieBut do you really feel alive without me?If so, be freeIf not, leave him for meBefore one of us has accidental babiesFor we are in loveDo you comeTogether ever with him?Is he dark enough?Enough to see your light?Do you brush your teeth before you kiss?Do you miss my smell?And is he bold enough to take you on?Do you feel like you belong?And does he drive you wild?Or just mildly free?What about me?What about me?
