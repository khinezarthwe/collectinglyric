Now I know that the end comesYou knew since the beginningDidn't want to believe it's trueYou are alone again, my soul will be with youWhy is the clock even runningIf my world isn't turning?Hear your voice in the doorway windYou are alone again, I'm only waitingYou tear into pieces my heartBefore you leave with no repentanceI cried to you, my tears turn into bloodI'm ready to surrenderYou say that I take it too hardAnd all I ask is comprehensionBring back to you a piece of my broken heartI'm ready to surrenderI remember the momentsLife was short for the romanceLike a rose it will fade awayI'm leaving everythingNo regrets, war is overThe return of a soldierPut my hands on my bleeding heartI'm leaving all behind, no longer waitingYou tear into pieces my heartBefore you leave with no repentanceI cried to you, my tears turn into bloodI'm ready to surrenderYou say that I take it too hardAnd all I ask is comprehensionBring back to you a piece of my broken heartI'm ready to surrenderI've waited for so long!You tear into pieces my heartBefore you leave with no repentanceI cried to you, my tears turn into bloodI'm ready to surrenderYou say that I take it too hardAnd all I ask is comprehensionBring back to you a piece of my broken heartI'm ready to surrenderI'm ready to surrender
