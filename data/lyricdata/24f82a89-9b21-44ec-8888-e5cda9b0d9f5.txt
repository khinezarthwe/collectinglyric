Strumming my pain with his fingersSinging my life with his wordsKilling me softly with his songKilling me softly with his songTelling my whole life with his wordsKilling me softlyWith his songI heard he sang a good songI heard he had a styleAnd so I came to see him and listen for a whileAnd there he was this young boyA stranger to my eyesStrumming my pain with his fingersSinging my life with his wordsKilling me softly with his songKilling me softly with his songTelling my whole life with his wordsKilling me softlyWith his songI felt all flushed with feverEmbarrassed by the crowdI felt he found my letters and read each one out loudI prayed that he would finishBut he just kept right onStrumming my pain with his fingersSinging my life with his wordsKilling me softly with his songKilling me softly with his songTelling my whole life with his wordsKilling me softlyWith his song...He sang as if he knew meIn all my dark despairAnd then he looked right through me as if I wasn't thereAnd he just kept on singingSinging clear and strongStrumming my pain with his fingersSinging my life with his wordsKilling me softly with his songKilling me softly with his songTelling my whole life with his wordsKilling me softlyWith his songStrumming my pain with his fingersSinging my life with his wordsKilling me softly with his songKilling me softly with his songTelling my whole life with his wordsKilling me softlyHe was strumming my painYeah he was singing my lifeKilling me softly with his songKilling me softly with his songTelling my whole life with his wordsKilling me softly with his song
