Walk home,Drowning these memories in the rainBiting my lip to transfer this painYou're gone,And I'm still going through withdrawlNext time around I'll build a stronger wallYou broke my guard with guiltless eyesDevoured me like a virus from insideAnd came back just to salt the woundsNow thanks to you...CHORUS:I started running outI started running awayWhen I get too close I'm scared to stayI started running outI started running awayNow others pay for your mistakesYou needed more attention then I gaveInstead of talking you just played gamesAnd smiledAs my whole world became unstitchedI wish I'd know you could be such a heartless bitchYou broke my guard with guiltless eyesDevoured me like a virus from insideAnd came back just to salt the woundsNow thanks to you...CHORUS x3
