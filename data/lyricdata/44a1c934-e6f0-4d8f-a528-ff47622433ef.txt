Layin' on my backIn the newly mown grassRain is coming downBut I know the clouds will passYou bring me teaSay "the babe's a-sleepin'"Lay down beside meLove ain't for keepingBlack ash from the foundryHangs like a hoodBut the air is perfumedBy the burning firewoodThe seeds are burstingThe spring is seepingLay down my darlingLove ain't for keepingLay down beside meLove ain't for keepingLay down beside meLove ain't for keepingLay down my darlingLove ain't for keeping
