He trembles in the bitter windUntil it's time for us to speakWhilst others here are sleeping soundI'll slip away by floorboard creakUpon the hill he'll hear my secretsShock the colours to bleach insideWhilst others there are sleeping soundJust we two will confideListen to his body moanMake a wish and send us homeTo spin the gold and silver stitchesWe can turn his rags to richesWith frosty jack on fingernailThro' shoe black smile he'll tell-a-taleCome whisper thro' your lips of strawA moment torn forevermoreListen to his body groanMake a wish to send us homeTo spin the gold and silver stitchesWe can turn his rags to richesMy so-called friends say you're not aliveI'll bake their bones for telling liesThen pull the pastry from the pieAnd pour the gravy in their eyeListen to his body moanMake a wish and send us homeTo spin the gold and silver stitchesWe can turn his rags to riches
