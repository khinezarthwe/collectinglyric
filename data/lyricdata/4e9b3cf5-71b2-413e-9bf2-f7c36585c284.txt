They always said it would comeDown to thisThere is no time left toReminisceChasing a dream can leadYou to ruinSometimes the best don't know what their doingLosing my cool, Losing controlNothing to add, Nothing to showDigging myself deeper into this hole[Chorus]Shot to hellShot to hellIt's all shot to hellShot to hell.No one could take what theseEyes have seenCan't make some sense ofWhat it could meanIs it real or is it some kind of dream[Chorus]The visions lostShot to hellI count the costShot to hellWhere can I turnShot to hellI feel the burnNow it's clear so easy to see,This is a world that's not meant for meOnly one that that I can truly be free.I feel the burnI count the costWhere can I turnMy visions lost[Chorus]
