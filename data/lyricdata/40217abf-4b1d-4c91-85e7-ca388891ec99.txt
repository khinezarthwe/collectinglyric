Those crazy nights, I do remember in my youthI do recall, those were the best times, most of allIn the heat with a blue jean girlBurnin' love comes once in a lifetimeShe found me singing by the rail road trackTook me home, we danced by moonlightThose summer nights are callin',Stone in loveCan't help myself I'm fallin'Stone in loveOld dusty roads, led to the riverRunnin' slowShe pulled me down, and in cloverWe'd go 'roundIn the heat with a blue jean girlBurnin' love comes once in a lifetimeOo the memories never fade awayGolden girl, I'll keep you forever.Those summer nights are callin',Stone in loveCan't help myself I'm fallin'Stone in loveThose summer nights are callin',Stone in loveCan't help myself I'm fallin'Stone in love
