Lonely is the night when you find yourself aloneYour demons come to light and your mind is not your ownLonely is the night when there's no one left to callYou feel the time is right, say, the writing's on the wallIt's a high time to fight when the walls are closin' inCall it what you like, it's time you got to winLonely, lonely, lonely, your spirit's sinkin' downYou find you're not the only stranger in this townRed lights, green lights, stop 'n go jiveHeadlines, deadlines jammin' your mindYou been stealin' shots from the sideLet your feelings go for a rideThere's danger out tonight, the man is on the prowlGet the dynamite, the boys are set to prowlLonely is the night when you hear the voices callAre you ready for a fight? Do you wanna take it all?Slowdown, showdown, waitin' on lineShowtime, no time for changin' your mindStreets are ringin', march to the soundLet your secrets follow you downSomebody's watchin' you, baby, so much you can doNobody's stoppin' you, baby, from makin' it tooOne glimpse'll show you now, baby, what the music can doOne kiss'll show you now, baby, it can happen to youNo more sleepin', wastin' our timeMidnight creeping's first on our mindsNo more lazin' 'round the TVYou'll go crazy, come out with me
