It's a callI fell into your arms that nightDon't askIt's the time we had apart to sort things outJust don't askIt's the work you saying you're doingBut baby, I don't even askIt's the love that came undone between usand nobody ever asksThere's a place and time for everything I knowDon't askBut when I'm around you still I lose controlJust don't askYou suggest the struggle goes both waysbut baby, I don't even askI just wish you had a little faithbut I'm learning not to ask
