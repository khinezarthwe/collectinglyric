Stand here for me angelOh little child so broken and wildBear not for life on your shoulderJust kiss it one last timeWas the music too loud for you, too raw to be trueWere the abstracts too dark for you, I beg you now too......watch the sky so bright, see all its light - fade!Here I am, was it everything you spoke ofOh little angelYeah! Here I am, was it verything you've dreamt ofOh little angelBow down for me heavenly one, shed not those tears my little friendFear not God anymore because you'll find him in my armsWas the volume too high for you, too tough for the blueWere desires too dark for you, too good to be true...watch the sky so bright, see all its light - fade!Here I am, was it everything you spoke ofOh little angelYeah! Here I am, was it verything you've dreamt ofOh little angelTell me now how your wings got brokenTell me now how your spine got whipped by leatherTell me now how your tounge got splitTell me all the things you need to fell to drift awayWatch the sky so bright see all its lightWatch the sky so full of lightFor the last time so bright
