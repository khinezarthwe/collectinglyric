GO!!!Coward, the next time you want to fuck me over stab me in the frontCan I still see my future in your eyesOr can I picture myself stone dead in your embraceAnd your cruel crimson smile kills me quietlyNo one could have their moments free from your withering touch...Fuck off like you're the only one who has ever cried or been broken by loveSpare me your pity party drunk off your own misfortunesWallowing in your blissful melancholyCan you taste my blood?You knew that this would kill me but you carried on and on with your selfish shit.Everyone cared about you why couldn't youInstead your greed compelled you to steal other silver linings...Burnt down my world, you killed my hopeSpread out the ash and walked awayHow could you just close off your eyes...Turn tail and run, you are the greatest cowardcome onDamn right I am still pissed...Next time I see you we will see who has the upper handKiss my fist. Taste the floor. Tired of your games... fuck off goodbye...
