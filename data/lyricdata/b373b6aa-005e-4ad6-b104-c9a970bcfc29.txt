The sun came up with no conclusionsFlowers sleeping in their bedsThe city's cemetery's hummingI'm wide awake it's morningI have my drugs, I have my womanThey keep away my lonelinessMy parents they have their religionBut sleep in separate housesI read the body count out of the paperAnd now it's written all over my faceNo one ever plans to sleep out in the gutterSometimes that's just the most comfortable place!So, I'm drinking, breathing, writing, singingEvery day I'm on the clockMy mind races with all my longingsBut can't keep up with what I gotSo I hope I don't sound too ungratefulWhat history gave modern menA telephone to talk to strangersMachine guns and a camera lensSo, when you're asked to fight a war that's over nothingIt's best to join the side that's gonna winAnd no one's sure how all of this got startedBut we're gonna make 'em god damn certain how it's gonna endOh yeah we will, oh yeah we will!Well I could have been a famous singerIf I had someone else's voiceBut failure's always sounded betterLet's fuck it up boys, make some noise!The sun came up with no conclusionsFlowers sleeping in their bedsThe city's cemetery's hummingI'm wide awake, it's morning
