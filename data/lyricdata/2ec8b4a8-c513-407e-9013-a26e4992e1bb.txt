You dumb ass fool, you lost it all,You had your chance but moved too slow,Now look around this lonely town,Where every smiling face just brings you down,Just brings you down.You let it slip, so get a grip,There's no one else to blame for this,Now walk around this lonely town,Where every smiling face just brings you down,Just brings you down.Stick around and watch me fall apart,Watch me lose the game that I made up,Stick around whilst I default the loan,Watch me reap the pain that I have sown.I wanted all, all I could take,I wanted everything my way,Thought I can't lose, thought I was smart,But then that girl turned round and broke my heart.And broke my heart.Stick around and watch me fall apart,Watch me lose the game that I made up,Stick around whilst I default the loan,Watch me reap the pain that I have sown.Stick around and watch me fall apart,Watch me fall apart, watch me fall apartStick around whilst I default the loan,Watch me reap the pain that I have sown.
