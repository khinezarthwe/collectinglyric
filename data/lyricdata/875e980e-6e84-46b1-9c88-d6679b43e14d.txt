Every now and thenI get a little too closeTo a kind of truth that's not worth thinking aboutBut you can't stop the mind from wanderingYou've gotta slow it downMaybe get yourself under controlAnd it's hard to stop the ponderingAnd there have been points whenI feel like I've been on a rollBut then those curtains get drawnAnd the chances that you thought you hadThey really come to nothing at allAnd I have no needFor such thingsBut to make you happyDoes it make you happy?And I've busted strings on this guitarMakes me feel like I'm getting nowhereCould you make me happy?And if you keep me on your rightCould I keep you on my left?And there's a question on your lipsOn your finger tipsStabbing in the darkLike you're cut, cut,Cutting your fringe backBut it's grown out at such an angleThat the shears aren't sharpYou've got to straight, straight,Straighten the blades upAnd if I could make it easierI would always try to make it easierBut to be a cautious operatorIs the way toStop this falling apartAnd I have no needFor such thingsBut to make you happyDoes it make you happy?And I've busted strings on this guitarMakes me feel like I'm getting nowhereCould you make me happy?And I have no needFor such thingsBut to make you happyMake you happyDoes it make you happy?Does it make you happy?And if you keep me on your rightCould I keep you on my left?
