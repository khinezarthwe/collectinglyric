This is the last callThey'll ever hear me sendLast call for a better lifeWedding bells and cheap champagneLast call for a Friday nightIn bathroom stalls and crowded barsLast call right before your eyesWe celebrate our severed livesLast call, where are your friendsThey speak the sin, the sin of silence nowEverything we build, it falls apartAnd the architect abandons usLast call when I held you tightThe DJ played cuts from the nightLast call where we used to meetKnow we looked away, and we still repeatCircular breathingWe'll separate these feelingsHeart attack, efficiencyErase the figure as it fallsEverything we build, it falls apartAnd the architect abandons usThe wedding starts, the guests step inThe church bells ringing endlesslyThe bride and groom are hand in handAnd everything goes as it's plannedParents smile, the priest chokes upOrgan plays Amazing GraceAnd underneath the thin white veilYou can hear them sayLast call for the matching heartsLast call for the yellow birdsLast call for the two of usAnd the people sangEverything is falling apartEverything is falling apartEverything is falling apartEverything is falling apartEverything is falling apartEverything is falling apartEverything is falling apartEverything is falling apart
