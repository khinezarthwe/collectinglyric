The night was so cold all the cats had gone homeI hate to be told what to do, lordI hide under awnings like rats in a stormI hide under cars when they’re left in the parking lotsOh, now I know what you meanWhen you said I was sick in my heart at nineteenBut I’m older now and I’m wellSo come over here let me look in your mirrorsThe years are beginning to show, lordThere’s been a darkness upon us so longIt’s hard not to feel that our livesAre not always our ownNow I know what you meanWhen you said I was sick in my heart at nineteenBut I’m older nowAnd I’m twice as wellSo come over hereLet me look in your mirrorsAn asp and an arrowAnd a lamb with a furrowed browStay with meBecause I have been dying to meet youAnd now you’re hereI feel I could kill just to keep youBe calm the tell-tale heartThat leaves us beaten in the darkTomorrow see the scarsThey’ll leave with feathers and of tarThey’ll leave you lying in the parking lots
