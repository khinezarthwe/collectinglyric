Stay out of the lightOf the photographs that I gave youYou can say a prayer if you need toOr just get in line and I'll grieve youCan I meet you, alone?Another night and I'll see youOh, another night and I'll be youSome other way to continueTo hide my faceOh, another knife in my handsA stain that never comes off the sheetsClean me offI'm so dirty, babeThe kind of dirtyWhere the waterNever cleans off the clothesI keep a book of the names and thoseOnly go so far'Til you bury themSo deep and down we goTouched by angels thoughI fall out of graceI did it all so maybeI'd live this every dayAnother knife in my handsA stain that never comes off the sheetsClean me offI'm so dirty, babeIt ain't the moneyAnd it sure as hell ain't just for the fameIt's for the bodiesI claim and thoseOnly go so far'Til you bury themSo deep and down we goDownAnd down we goAnd down we goAnd down we goAnd we all fall downI triedI triedAnd we'll all dance aloneTo the tune of your deathWe'll love againWe'll laugh againAnd it's better off this wayAnd never againAnd never againThey gave us two shots to the back of the headAnd we're all dead nowWell never againAnd never againThey gave us two shots to the back of the headAnd we're all dead nowI triedOne more nightOne more nightWell I'm laughing, crying, laughingI triedWell I triedWell I tried'Cause I triedBut I liedI, I triedI triedI triedAnd we'll love againWe'll laugh againWe'll cry againAnd we'll dance againAnd it's better off this waySo much better off this wayI can't clean the blood off the sheets in my bedAnd never againAnd never againThey gave us two shots to the back of the headAnd we're all dead now
