There are days when she's a whisperNights when she's a screamA reason to wake up in the morningTo close your eyes and dreamShe'll curse you like a sailorShe'll wound you with her eyesShe always makes it betterBut she won't apologizeI know everything about her but don't know her at allShe's a ride on a mystery trainTo a place you've never been beforeBetter hold on tight to that mystery trainYou're not in Kansas anymoreShe's a rideMystery trainShe cries because she's happyShe sings songs when she's madLike a stiff drink when you need itShe's good at being badAnd long before you knew her you knew she was the oneShe's a ride on a mystery trainTo a place you've never been beforeBetter hold on tight to that mystery trainYou're not in Kansas anymoreShe's a rideMystery trainI know everything about her but don't know her at allShe's a ride on a mystery trainTo a place I've never been beforeBetter hold on tight to that mystery trainI'm not in Kansas anymoreShe's a rideOn a mystery trainShe's a rideOn a mystery train
