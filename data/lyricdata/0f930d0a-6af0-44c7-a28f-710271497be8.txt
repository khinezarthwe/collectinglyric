TodayI hear my angerAnd it's screaming at meYour wordsAttack my sensesAnd make me screamLooking back and forth at youShould I, should IWaste my time now?Looking back and forth at youShould I, should IPay no mind now?TodayInside my eyesI'm clenching my fistsMy hateIt burns inside of meInhuman thoughts cloud my mindLooking back and forth at youShould I, should IWaste my time now?Looking back and forth at youShould I, should IPay no mind now?What did I ever doTo deserve this from you?When will this fade out?And when you eat your wordsWill you still never learn?Don't let words get aroundLooking back and forth at youShould I, should IWaste my time now?Looking back and forth at youShould I, should IPay no mind now?
