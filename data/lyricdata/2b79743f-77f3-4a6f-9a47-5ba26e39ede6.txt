Everyday that I don't see your face is a tragedy andTime away could be time staring into your eyesEveryday that I don't see your face feels forever to meAnd all the while I'm away you'll be there on my mindAnd we might find, in our lifetimeWhen the lights go out, that the tears fill up in our eyesBut it's only for the meantimeAnd before too long I will be right there at your sideEveryday that I don't see your face is a tragedy andI'm afraid that we might lose the feeling insideBecause there's no other sound that can make me go weak at kneeslike the sound of your voice on the end of a lineAnd we might find, in our lifetimeWhen the lights go out, that the tears fill up in our eyesBut it's only for the meantimeAnd before too long I will be right there at your side...For a while
