The convoy lights are dead aheadThe merchantmen lay in their bedThe thump of diesels hammers downIn the oily sea-the killing groundHis knuckles white his eyes alightHe slams the hatch on the deadly nightA cunning fox in the chickens lairA hound of hell and the devil don't carechorus:Running silent,running deep,we are your final prayerWarriors in secret sleep,a merchantman's nightmareA silent death lies waiting, for all of you belowRunning silent,running deep,sink into your silent sleepChill the hearts of fighting menIn open ocean wondering when?The lethal silver fish will flyThe boat will shiver-men will dieA cast of millions-a part to playKiller? victim? or fool for a dayObeying an order-men have to dieUs or them - a well rehearsed liechorusThe lifeboats shattered the hull is tornThe tar black smell of burning oilOn the way down to Davy JonesEvery man for himself - you're on your ownThe wolf eyes watch the crosswire'Stern tubes ready','aim and fire'They can pin some medal on your chestBut in two more weeks - dead like the restchorus
