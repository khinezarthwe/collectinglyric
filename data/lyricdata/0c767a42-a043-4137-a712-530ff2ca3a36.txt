Scream in pain as you gasp for breathNow it's time to face your final deathMelted faces blood is on the groundEarth and darkness utters not a soundFlash of light fills the midnight airScraps of metal flying here and thereSatan laughs as he watches them bleedWorld of sin to the Devils feedNo escape the end is nearToo late, die in fearScared now of judgment dayFinal death is on its wayMinds decaying in the acid rainSavage torment as they go insaneMutilation of forgotten soulsSatan drags them down into his holeDogs of war, for your blood they lustRadiation turns your body to dustWatching fallout as it fills the skyNow it's time for this planet to die
