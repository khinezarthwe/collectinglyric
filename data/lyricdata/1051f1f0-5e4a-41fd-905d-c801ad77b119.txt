I'm walking young and strongBut just a little too thinI may be happy but I haven't clue to this life in my mindStay with meWe could learn to fightlike every good boy shouldCling to meWe are blacked out in visions of ChinaTonightI'm building heroes againI never thought of beforeI remember the fashion but don't have a clue to your life in my mindStay with meWe could learn to fightLike every good boy shouldCling to meWe are blacked out in visions of ChinaTonightWe walk backwards say nothingMy visions of ChinaWe're young and strong in this partyWe're building our visions of ChinaWe walk backwards say nothingVisions of ChinaWe're young and strong in this partyWe're building our visions of ChinaWe walk backwards say nothingOur visions of ChinaWe're young and strong in this partyWe're building our visions of China
