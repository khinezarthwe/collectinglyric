On a night like tonightyou saved my lifeRed and greenwet shoes slip on refracted lightsRunning faster than my legs can take meShouting louder than my lungs allow meWhy, as the rivers runStill got time for someoneBe my embrace nowBe my embrace now(x 2)Light a match,bring the flame over to your eyeSlipping past, you won't see me before you dieBreaking down our sleep, my head's still achingThis war is killing you and all around meWhy, as the rivers runStill got time for someoneBe my embrace nowBe my embrace now(x 2)You go, go, go, go(x 4)Why, as the rivers runStill got time for someoneBe my embrace nowBe my embrace now(x 4)
