stars leave the morningsleep clouds my viewDon't let them come round hereAnd call to youI didn't noticeIt's a crime too fewI didn't noticeIt's a crime to fearI tried to sleep aloneBut I couldn't do itYou could be sitting next to meI wouldn't know itIf I told you you were wrongI don't remember saying itI don't remember saying itI'll be a shadowIn the cedar roomleave just a memoryAlone with youI didn't see thatIt's a call too soonI couldn't see thatIt's a call to youAnd I tried to sleep aloneBut I couldn't do itYou could be sitting next to meAnd I wouldn't know itIf I told you you were wrongI don't remember saying itI don't remember saying itThe cedar roomThe cedar roomThe cedar room
