I need to be myselfI can't be no one elseI'm feeling supersonic, give me gin and tonicYou can have it all but how much do you want itYou make me laughGive me your autographCan I ride with you in your BMWYou can sail with me in my yellow submarineYou need to find out'Cause no one's gonna tell you what I'm on aboutYou need to find a way for what you wanna sayBut before tomorrow'Cause my friend said he'd take you homeSits in a corner all aloneHe lives under a waterfallNobody can see him, nobody can ever hear him callNobody can ever hear him callYou need to be yourselfYou can't be no one elseI know a girl called Elsa, she's into Alka SeltzerShe sniffs it through a cane on a supersonic trainAnd she makes me laughI got her autographShe done it with a doctor on a helicopterShe's sniffin' in her tissue, sellin' the Big IssueWhen she finds outNo one's gonna tell her what I'm on aboutYou need to find a way for what you wanna sayBut before tomorrow'Cause my friend said he'd take you homeSits in a corner all aloneHe lives under a waterfallNobody can see him, nobody can ever hear him callNobody can ever hear him call
