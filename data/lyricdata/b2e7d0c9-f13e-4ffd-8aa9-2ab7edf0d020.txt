One... two...Steal my heart... and hold my tongueI feel my time... my time has comeLet me in... unlock the doorI never felt this way beforeAnd the wheels just keep on turningThe drummer begins to drumI don't know which way I'm goingI don't know which way I've comeHold my head... inside your handsI need someone... who understandsI need someone... someone who hearsFor you I've waited all these yearsFor you I'd wait... 'til Kingdom ComeUntil my day... my day is doneAnd say you'll come... and set me freeJust say you'll wait... you'll wait for meIn your tears... and in your bloodIn your fire... and in your floodI hear you laugh... I heard you singI wouldn't change a single thingAnd the wheels just keep on turningThe drummers begin to drumI don't know which way I'm goingI don't know what I've becomeFor you I'd wait... 'til kingdom comeUntil my days... my days are doneSay you'll come... and set me freeJust say you'll wait... you'll wait for meJust say you'll wait... you'll wait for meJust say you'll wait... you'll wait for me
