The stars they sinkIn the oceans of inkLong black ribbons of carsAnd in the taxiYou ask me how I'm doingBut you already knowBeyond, beyond is not throughIt's only a reflection of youAnd somethings at the windowIt motions with its fingersCalling me beyondThe sadness is mineThe sadness is mineIt's why you're not helping meWhatever has come for meOh, I can give you whatever you're wantingJust take it and spare me spare mePlease, oh tell me this is only a warning, noPlease have mercy let me goIf only a day to let her knowWithout her I'm nothing at allThe change is happening and I'm almost goneIn her heart is my faithAnd it wins against the sadnessThe train it moves through the desertThe horses they will challenge its strideAnd into the boxcar she leapsAnd is my heroAnd penetrates the demons insideThe clouds they passBut they're moving so fastI watch them collideCollide and collapse in her arms like a newborn childAnd I am at once rebornThe sadness is mineThe sadness is mineIt's why you're not helping meWhatever has come for meOh, I can give you whatever you're wantingJust take it and spare me spare mePlease tell me this is only a warning, noPlease have mercy let me goIf only a day to let her knowWithout her I was nothing at allThe change is happening and I'm almost goneIn her heart is my faithAnd it wins against the sadnessThe fog in the moteAs he grabs my throatIt lifts as she comesShe opens her cloak and it's the color of the bloodAnd is the sign of what now must comeDeny, deny me my destinyI am not ready to goI am the horror that brings us to the morningWhere I will have to stand and fight God!The sadness is mineThe sadness is mineIt's why you're not helping meWhatever has come for meOh, I can give you whatever you're wantingJust take it and spare me spare mePlease, oh tell me this is only a warning, noPlease have mercy let me goIf only a day to let her knowWithout her I was nothing at allThe change is happening and I'm almost goneIn her heart is my faithAnd it wins against the sadness
