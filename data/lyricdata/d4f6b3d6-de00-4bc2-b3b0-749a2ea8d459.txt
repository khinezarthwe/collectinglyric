The serpent knowsWhen the curtain fallsWith denial's blindfoldHe greets another dayDon't believe the maskIt adapts to any lieA perfect tenWhen reality caves inDon't tell meTell my ghostCause I blame himFor all I don't want to knowI found secrets about life's undertowLife's wrapped in a riddleEasier said than doneHate to play the victimRather run and hideDon't believe the maskIt adapts to any lieThe perfect tenWhen reality caves inDon't tell meTell my ghostCause I blame himFor all I don't want to knowI found secrets about life's undertowLet them take me far awayCrawl back in placeIt's easier to cope behind the curtainWipe the worries awayNo thought about the consequenceDon't believe the maskIt adapts to any lieThe perfect tenWhen reality caves inDon't tell meTell my ghostCause I blame himFor all I don't want to knowI found secrets about lies undertowLet them take me far away
