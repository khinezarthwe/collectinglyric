Every night I dream the same dreamOf getting older and older all the timeI ask you now, what does this mean?Are all these problems just in my mind?Things are easy when you're a childBut now these pressures are dropped on my headThe length I've gone are just long milesWould they be shorter if I were dead?Every time I look in my pastI always wish I was thereI wish my youth would forever lastWhy are these times so unfair?Look at my friends and see what they've doneAsk myself why they've had to changeI liked them better when they were youngNow all these times are rearrangedI look down and stand there and cryNothing will ever be the sameThe sun is rising now, I ask whyThe clouds are falling, here comes the rainEvery time I look in my pastI always wish I was thereI wish my youth would forever lastWhy are these times so unfair?Every night I dream the same dreamOf getting older and older all the timeI ask you now, what does this mean?Are all these problems just in my mind?Things are easy when you're a childBut now these pressures are dropped on my headThe length I've gone are just long milesWould they be shorter if I were dead?Every time I look in my pastI always wish I was thereI wish my youth would forever lastWhy are these times so unfair?
