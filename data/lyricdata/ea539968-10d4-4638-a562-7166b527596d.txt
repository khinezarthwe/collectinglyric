Toronto is greatAnd Brantford is just fineI think it was in Ottawa that i had the best timeThough Montreal's appealingI need the real thingParis, oh Paris be mineWhen i was just sixteen years oldThat's when i found out where i needed to goI found the answer in a Tropic of CancerDiscovered lovers and dirty whoresIn a night school book reportNow some years have passed and i still knowI've found a garden for my heart to growThe big Eiffel Tower like a beautiful metal flowerWill smile and sing on down to me'Je suis ci joyeux que vous etes ici!'And i won't be afraidOf no men in beretsI will dance and parade all over townAnd i can't get hurtBy no women in striped shirtsWon't be shy or embarassedNo, not here in ParisToronto is greatAnd my friends are whyI think of all the crazy nights drinking cheap red wineAnd though certainly i will miss youI heard they have nice tissuesin Paris, oh Paris be mineParis, oh Paris be mine
