I want to wake up in yourWhite, white sunAnd I want to wake up in your worldWith no painBut I'll just suffer in a hope to die somedayWhile you are numb all of the wayWhen I hate it I know I can feel butWhen you love you know it's not realNoWhen I hate it I know I can feel butWhen you love you know it's not realAnd I am resigned to this wicked fucking worldOn its way to hellThe living are dead andI hope to join them tooI know what to do and I do it well...When I hate it I know I can feel butWhen you love you know it's not realNoWhen I hate it I know I can feel butWhen you love you know it's not realShoot myself to love youIf I loved myself I'd be shooting youShoot myself to love youIf I loved myself I'd be shooting youShoot myself to love youIf I loved myself I'd be shooting youShoot myself to love youIf I loved myself I'd be shooting youIf I loved myself I'd be shooting youIf I loved myself I'd be shooting you
