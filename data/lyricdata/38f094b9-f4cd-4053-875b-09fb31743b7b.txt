When I was a kid I grew up in a house on a hillNot the top, not the bottom, but the middleAnd I still remember where I cracked my headIn the vacant lot, there's a row of tiny houses there nowAnd we used to light fires in the guttersAnd I could cool my head on the concrete stepsBut the girl down the street hit my sister on the headWith a stick and we hid behind my fatherAs he knocked on the parents' doorTo tell them what she didBut the parents were drunk so they really didn't give a shitAnd the girl down the street said a dog couldn't bark'Cause a man with an axe cut its voicebox outBut my older sister told me that it prob'ly wasn't trueAnd I believe what she said 'cause she took me by the handOne time when a coupla men drove down the hill in a white vanSaid there was a phone box filled with money 'round the cornerAnd I woulda gone along but she took me by the handTo the house in the middle of the hillIn the middle of the hill, in the middle of the hillAnd my mother knew the words to a lot of different songsAnd we'd always sing the harmonies, yeah we'd sing alongShe had cold, cold hands when the fever hitAnd then the noises that the trains made sounded like people in my headAnd the stories that the ceiling toldThrough the pictures and the grains in the pine-wood boardsAnd let me stay outside 'til the sky went redAnd I could cool my head on the concrete stepsAnd you could never really see the top from the bottomBut I don't pay enough attention to the good things when I got 'emAnd you could never really see the top from the bottomI don't pay enough attention to the good things when I got 'em (x 4)
