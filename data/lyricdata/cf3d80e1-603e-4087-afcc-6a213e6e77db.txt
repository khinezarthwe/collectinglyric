There's nothing in the way I walk that could tell you where I'm goingThere's nothing in the words I speak that can betray anything I'm knowingDon't think about the way I dress, you can fit me on a labeled shelfDon't pretend that you know me 'cause I don't even know myselfOoh I don't know myselfI don't mind if you try once in a whileI don't mind if I cry once in a whileThe doors aren't shut as tight as they might seemI'm just trying to fight my way out of this dreamDon't listen to the words I say, weighing up if I'm enlightenedDon't shiver as you pass me by, 'cause mister I'm the one who's frightenedThe police just came and left, they wanted me and no one elseDon't pretend that you know me 'cause I don't even know myselfI said I don't know myselfI don't mind if you try once in a whileI don't mind if I cry once in a whileThe doors aren't shut as tight as they might seemI'm just trying to fight my way out of this dreamDo you remember me, I don't remember youDo you still love me, you know I think you doI have been gone, and some prison warder knows my screamI'm just trying to fight my way out of this dreamThere's only five who know my real nameAnd my mother don't believe they know itWhat she called me is the way I'm stayingAnd no one'll ever know itCome on all of you big boys, come on all of you elvesDon't pretend that you know me 'cause I don't even know myselfI said I don't know myselfI don't mind if you try once in a whileAnd I don't mind if I cry once in a while
