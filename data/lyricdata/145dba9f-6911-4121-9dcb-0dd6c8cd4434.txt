Over and over, babyMaking me play this gameIf true love waits, it's a big mistakeNo need to feel ashamedBaby...You make me feel so helplesssI meet you after schoolI'm so tired of kissing,Shooting and missingMaking me feel a foolYou never wanna give me someYou're gettin' off on kingdom comeWell, if the Lord take you tonightC'mon girl, you best treat me rightBut I don't believe in happenstanceSo you're gonna give me your last dance
