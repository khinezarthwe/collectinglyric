First thing we'd climb a tree and maybe then we'd talkOr sit silently and listen to our thoughtsWith illusions of someday casting a golden lightNo dress rehearsal, this is our lifeAnd that's where the hornet stung meAnd I had a feverish dreamWith revenge and doubtTonight we smoke them outYou are ahead by a century (this is our life)You are ahead by a century (this is our life)You are ahead by a centuryStare in the morning shroud and then the day beganI tilted your cloud, you tilted my handRain falls in real time and rain fell through the nightNo dress rehearsal, this is our lifeBut that's when the hornet stung meAnd I had a serious dreamWith revenge and doubtTonight we smoke them outYou are ahead by a century (this is our life)You are ahead by a century (this is our life)You are ahead by a centuryYou are ahead by a century (this is our life)You are ahead by a century (this is our life)You are ahead by a centuryAnd disappointing you is getting me down
