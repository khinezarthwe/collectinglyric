The distant countryMy share of the estateThe poisonMy stomachIs filled withPig podsNo longer worthyTo be called your sonBut Pappa runs  to meAnd in his armsAround me he does throwI beenGivenThe best robeRings and sandalsFor my bloody feetBring on the fatted calfAnd let all have a feastThis son of mineOnce was deadBut now is alive againMyLionSleepsTonightAs a dog returnsTo his vomitSo I have runI have set my affection on theeThe only one andI turn my eyes from allThe worthless things andI have set my affection on theeThe only one and ohThis son is doneThe poison has been drained
