A stinking aromaSpreads into my sense of smellA smell of aging filthFrom the body you wearYou will soon becomeShattered into fragmentsFragments dissolvingFragments to be defamed - againYou're a prisonerIn your filthy mindHanging tied upside downCause you're walking the aardvark trail - forevermoreI give you hellWalking with blinded eyesFeeling the temperature risePleased to be a swineAs the devil rips your spine - awayI give you hell
