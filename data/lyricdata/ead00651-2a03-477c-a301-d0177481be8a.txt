With her high heel against the wallKind of dancing though not at allShe had stockings running up to her thighSnaps her fingers to keep the timeFrom the back of the room I saw her thereI said she wants to be alone and I shouldn't dareBut then she noticed me glance at herI had no choice but to dance with herThe lights that move sideways and up and downThe beat takes you over and spins you roundOur hearts steady-beating, the sweat turns to coldWe're slaves to the DJ and out of controlI watched her feet move, her hips they swayDoes a hair flip, then starts to sayOh my God, it's my favorite songI pull her close, and she sings alongWe can't slow down, even if we triedIf the record keeps spinning, so will IShe likes disco, and tastes like a tearTells me, don't stop dancing, and she's pulling me nearThe lights that move sideways and up and downThe beat takes you over and spins you roundOur hearts steady-beating, the sweat turns to coldWe're slaves to the DJ and out of controlWe've got nowhere to go, we've got nothing to proveInstead of dancing alone I should be dancing with youThis song is turning me on, the beat is doing me inOr maybe it's only you, but either way, let's beginWe've got nowhere to go, we've got nothing to proveInstead of dancing alone I should be dancing with youThis song is turning me on, the beat is doing me inOr maybe it's only you, but either way, let's beginWe've got nowhere to go, we've got nothing to proveInstead of dancing alone I should be dancing with youThis song is turning me on, the beat is doing me inOr maybe it's only you, but either way, let's beginThe lights that move sideways and up and downThe beat takes you over and spins you roundOur hearts steady-beating, the sweat turns to coldWe're slaves to the DJ and out of controlThe lights that move sideways and up and downThe beat takes you over and spins you roundOur hearts steady-beating, the sweat turns to coldWe're slaves to the DJ and out of control
