Go out and tell the societyThe talk of the town is on its wayThis is not bad only seriousDo understand, don't turn your back on meDoesn't matter heads or tailsPeople know my sins, I'm overwhelmedIt's the darkest night in a long long timeI¹ve been up all nightAnd walked up and down the stairsNo complaints no echoesI'm trying to be good,Ain't trying to behave wellSometimes in the fall, fall, fall, fallThere'll be nothing to keep you far from meBefore I am long long long goneThere'll be nothing to keep me awayEvery night at seven o'clockEvery day at six in the morning tooPeople calling me up hereDidn't even take some time to look at themI'm long goneIf you're walking around then I'll go out tooYou¹ve been awake all nightI¹ve been lying on you thinking the sameLonely and forsakenWould you mind just to try a little less?Sometimes in the fall, fall, fall, fallThere'll be nothing to keep you far from meBefore I am long long long goneThere'll be nothing to keep me awayAnd it goes on and on and on, it's everlastingIt's always the same when you're next to meSometimes in the fall, fall, fall, fallThere'll be nothing to keep me awayLong goneMany eyes to see for meOnly yours to cry on my ashesLong goneIt's the darkest night and I'm far from youYou¹ve been awake all nightHe's a Nobel Prize I saidToo many eyes to see for meOnly yours to cry on my ashesLong goneIf the countdown on the Eiffel TowerCould show less than ten but more than a hundredTired to look at your photographsThat night through the phone you¹ve been asking for moreSometimes in the fall, fall, fall, fallThere'll be nothing to keep you far from meBefore I am long long long goneThere'll be nothing to keep me awayAnd it goes on and on and on, it's everlastingIt's always the same when you're next to meSometimes in the fall, fall, fall, fallThere'll be nothing to keep me away
