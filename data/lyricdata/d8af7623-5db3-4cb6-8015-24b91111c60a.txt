I can remember a place I used to goChrysanthemums of white, they seemed so beautifulI can remember, I searched for the amaranthI'd shut my eyes to seeOh, how I smiled then, so near the cherished onesI knew they would appear, saw not a single oneOh, how I smiled then, waiting so patientlyI'd make a wish and bleedWhile I waited I was wasting awayWhile I waited I was wasting awayI can remember, dreamt them so vividlySoft creatures draped in white, light kisses gracing meI can remember when I first realizedDreams were the only place to see themWhile I waited I was wasting awayWhile I waited I was wasting awayWhile I waited I was wasting awayHope was wasting away, faith was wasting away, I was wasting awayI never, never wanted this, always wanted to believeI never, never wanted this, how could I have become?I never, never wanted this, from the start I'd been deceivedI never, never wanted this, how could I have become?I never, never wanted this, I always wanted to believeI never, never wanted thisI never, never wanted this, from the start I'd been deceivedI never, never wanted thisInside a crumbling effigyBut you promisedSo dies all innocenceBut you promised meWhile I waited I was wasting awayWhile I waited I was wasting awayWhile I waited I was wasting awayHope was wasting away, faith was wasting away, I was wasting away
