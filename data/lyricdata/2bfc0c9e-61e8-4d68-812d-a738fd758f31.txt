There is still so much to seeThere is still so much to doI can't be more than half way throughI know I'm wasting precious timeBut I'll take it in my strideI've got a lot of things to put rightDon't get upsetIt's not my time yetI ain't saying my goodbyesDon't get upsetIt's not my time yetI ain't saying my goodbyesYou won't take life out of meYou can't take it out on meI know a good enough reason will come alongI can't tell you how it feelsAin't no other way you'll healAll these young men obsessed with deathDon't get upsetIt's not my time yetI ain't saying my goodbyesDon't get upsetIt's not my time yetI ain't saying my goodbyesYou don't get upsetYou don't get upsetYou don't get upsetYou don't get upset
