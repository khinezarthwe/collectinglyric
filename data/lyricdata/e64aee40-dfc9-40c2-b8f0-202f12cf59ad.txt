Done something real bad this timePractically signed my own death warrantShe was staring right at meBurning my eyelashesI was sweating like a virgin on death rowJust the two of us left in this rusty old tubNeither overjoyed to be out of loveTakes one black cloud to spoil the bright dayI was the black cloudShe was the bright dayIsobelle, remember how it used to feel?You and I and not the screaming animalswith yellow jealous eyesAnd not the decoration of the battle last nightwhen we wake up in the morningboth at opposite endsYou look so good I want to seehundreds and thousands of youCrawling through the desertlike a crusade of half-dead blue bottlesOur brains leave their skullsWalk the tightrope of ourrabbit in the headlight staresMelting together like pink and white marshmallowsYeah I was a fool and yes you were a foolBut who can name a pennythat has not been in the pocket of a foolIsobelle, remember how it used to feel?You and I and not the screaminganimals with yellow jealous eyesAnd not the decoration of the battle last nightWhen we wake up in the morningboth at opposite ends
