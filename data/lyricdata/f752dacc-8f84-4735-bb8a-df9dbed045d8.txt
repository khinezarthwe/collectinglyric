Fading, falling, lost in foreverWill I find a way to keep it togetherAm I strong enough to last through the weatherIn the hurricane of my lifeCan it be a conscious decisionThat I look for ways to alter my visionAm I speeding towards another collisionIn the alleyways of my lifeMemories don't lieYou know better thanMemories don't lieYou know better thanMemories don't lieYou know better thanThose who have fallen inMemories don't lieYou know better thanMemories don't lieYou know better thanMemories don't lieYou know better thanThose who have fallen inPlease believe meThat my eyes deceive meDon't stand me up; just leave meI have fallen again—this is the end:Pain redefinedShaking, burning up with the feverIn the realm of pain, I am the deceiverNow I lie to myself so I can believe herAs she disassembles my lifeI cannot dispel the illusionAll my hopes and dreams are drowned by confusionCan I find a way to make a solutionThat will reconfigure my lifeMemories don't lieYou know better thanMemories don't lieYou know better thanMemories don't lieYou know better thanThose who have fallen inMemories don't lieYou know better thanMemories don't lieYou know better thanMemories don't lieYou know better thanThose who have fallen inPlease believe meThat my ears deceive meDon't stand me up; just leave meI have fallen again—this is the end:Pain redefinedAnd I know that stillness shattersWe have all been frightened by the soundOf footsteps on the pavement of our livesI stand and fightI'm not afraid to dieElochai, bury me tonightPlease believe meThat the world deceives meDon't stand me up; just leave meI have fallen again—this is the end:Pain redefined
