Everything right is wrong againJust like in the long long trailerAll the dishes got broken and the car kept drivingAnd nobody would stop to save herWake me when it's over, touch my faceTell me every word has been erasedDon't you want to know the reasonWhy the cupboard's not appealingDon't you get the feeling thatEverything that's right is wrong againYou're a weasel overcome with dingeWeasel overcome but not before the damage doneThe healing doesn't stop the feelingEverything right is wrong againJust like in the long long trailerAll the dishes got broken and the car kept drivingAnd nobody would stop to save herAnd now the song is over nowAnd now the song is over nowAnd now the song is over nowThe song is over nowEverything right is wrong againEvery movement false, every four is waltz againEvery five and dime's been gained and spentTell me that you like my float upstreamDraw the line dividing laugh and screamYou know everything that I know so I knowYou've heard the voice that makes the silent noiseThat says thatEverything that's right is wrong againYou're a weasel overcome with dingeWeasel overcome but not before the damage doneThe healing doesn't stop the feelingEverything right is wrong againJust like in the long long trailerAll the dishes got broken and the car kept drivingAnd nobody would stop to save herAnd now the song is over nowAnd now the song is over nowAnd now the song is over nowThe song is over now
