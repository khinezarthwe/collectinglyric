I've got something up my sleeve that I don't wanna show you'Cause everytime I bleed, I make a fool of meI've got shaky little fingers, that hold on to your gripYou've got wrapped around my worldSo tight that I can't breatheI'm suffocatingWe come crashing downEverytime we go this far againWe come tumbling downEverytime we go this far againEverytime we goI've got nothing that I hide, except for what's insideI keep it all locked up in this prison we call loveI'm suffocatingWe come crashing downEverytime we go this far againWe come tumbling downEverytime we go this far againEverytime we goEverytime we goEverytime we goEverytime we goEverytime we goWe come crashing downEverytime we go this far againWe come tumbling downEverytime we go this far againWe come crashing downWe come tumbling downWe come crashing downEverytime we go this far againEverytime we goEverytime we go
