Me and Iyeah, we're going your waysound the trumpets and open the gatesno angels there to greet methey can't breatheand they won't see meAnd I'll do, I'll do,but a little won't help you nowI'll doI was a kid and you were my heroBathed in rhinestones and brand new chinosI was young, drunk and easyWe would duel, but our holsters were emptyAnd I'll do, I'll do,but a little won't help you nowI'll doAlong the wayside gonna change our namesThey're easily replacedIt comes on heavy like a symphony at the cinema'Cause even though we don't mean what we sayWe throw our words like bombs and hand grenadesArms are weighing like a monumentthat comes and goes in timelike highway signs we post along the waywe wonder where they've gone'Cause even though we don't mean what we sayWe throw our words like bombs and hand grenades
