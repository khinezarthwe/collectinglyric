How long can we wait hereTo say goodbye?The words once they're spokenAre words that we can't takeBack to where we were, beforeThings got in the wayLife gets so confusingWhen you know what you're losingYouMeWhy can't we see that there'sMore to love than we'll ever knowSometimes you're closer when you'reLetting goI wish the best for youI wish the best for youWe'll both regret the hurtingThat we will doYou'll learn to forget meAnd I'll tryI'll try to forget...YouMeWhy can't we see that there'sMore to love than we'll ever knowSometimes you're closer when you'reLetting goI wish the best for youI wish the bestIf you ever need a place that you can run toI'll be here, I'll be hereYouMeWhy can't we see that there'sMore to love than we'll ever knowSometimes you're closer when you'reLetting goI wish the best for youI wish the best for you
