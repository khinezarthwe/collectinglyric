(Chorus 1)As we trudge along through the mudAnd we tried to call it homeBut we weren't alright, not at allNot for one, for one, for one second(Chorus 2)Never have been one to write it downNow I think I canI know I'm stronger nowWho's looking southNot me I'm not looking backI'm done denying the truth to anyoneCause I'm alive(Repeat Chorus 1)You showed me howYou seemed to find a holeBut I just laughed and smiledBegged and rolled my eyesEven cried andDenied the truth to youJust like the truth to meMostly liedI'm not going to look back (x4)White it out like glittering wax butterflies...(Repeat Chorus 2)I'm not going to look back (x8)
