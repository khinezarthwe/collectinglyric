I swear I never watched you sleepingWell honey, I'm an honest manI guess it always gets me drinking, she makes me sadSweet, sweet and cold, clean up the mess and sleep the day awayWhen you call, I might be here, I might be goneBut here at the sound of the bells you cry, you've lost your mindBut dear, don't be sad, it's just a dream you dreamt you hadBut I ain't seen you look so goodSo honeyI guess it always gets me drinking, well holly, she makes me sadForgive me if I look so lonely, it's not that badSometimes it's just the sound of the TV that gets me alwaysWondering whySometimes it's just a conversation, that makes me cryHey, well I know, California might be warm this time of yearI should go, turn the engine and the radioIt's cold, always cold, this hotel room won't let me sleepTime, it's alright, I guess I'll just stay up all night
