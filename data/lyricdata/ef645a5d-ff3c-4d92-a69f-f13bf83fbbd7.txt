I wanna be your loveI wanna make you cryAnd sweep you off your feetI wanna hurt your prideI wanna slap your faceI wanna paint your nailsI wanna make you you screamI wanna braid your hairI wanna kiss your friendsI wanna make you laughI wanna dress the sameI wanna defend youI wanna squeeze your thighsI wanna kiss your eyelidsAnd corrupt your dreamsI wanna crash your carI wanna scratch your cheeksI wanna make you sickI wanna sell you outWant to expose your flawsI wanna steal your thingsI wanna show you offI wanna tell you liesI wanna write you booksI wanna turn you onI wanna make you cumTwo-hundred times a dayI wanna dry your tearsEvery time you're sadI wanna be your what's happeningI wanna be your only friendI only go all the wayThis time I'm not pretendingI can't take the trashYour trashy friends are spreading about usThey've got like V.D. personalitiesOh girl, that's so messed upYou see that sculpture on the hill?That's where she queered me outForeverThey're monitoring my subconscious massacres I knowBringing it closer to the surface so it's easily pervertibleI want to be a beastI want to make you proudAnd play with your headI want to take you outMake you feel adoredAnd buy you everythingI want to hurt you badMake you paranoidAnd say the sweetest thingsI want to help you growAnd for eternityI want to be your what's happeningI see car bombs in your eyes(Can you clap your hands?)(Clap-clap!)(Can you clap your hands?)(Clap-clap!)oooooohhh!Can you sing it?I hear (angels apologize?)
