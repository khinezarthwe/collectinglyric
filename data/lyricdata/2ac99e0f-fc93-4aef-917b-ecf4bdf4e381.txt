Did we lose ourselves again?Did we take in what's been said?Did we take the time to be,all the things we said we'd be?So we bury hopes in sandAnd my future's in my handsIt means nothingIt means nothingYou can find yourself apartBut you leave in which one you wantCause they love you all the sameThey just go by different namesDid you fly your flag today?Are you proud or just ashamed?It means nothingIt means nothingIt means nothingIt means nothingIt means nothingIf I haven't got youIf I haven't got youIf I haven't got youIf I haven't got youThe sun sets in the skyYou're the apple of my eyeIf the bomb goes off againBlows my brain around the trainAnd I hope that I'm with youCause I wouldn't know what to doIt means nothingIt means nothingIt means nothingIt means nothingIt means nothingIf I haven't got youIf I haven't got youIf I haven't got youIf I haven't got you
