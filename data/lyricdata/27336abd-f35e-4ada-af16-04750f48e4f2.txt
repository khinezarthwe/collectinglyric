'Don't look don't look,' the shadows breatheWhispering me away from you'Don't wake at night to watch her sleepYou know that you will always loseThis tremblingAdoredTousled birdmad girl...'But every night I burnEvery night I call your nameEvery night I burnEvery night I fall again'Oh don't talk of love,' the shadows purrMurmuring me away from you'Don't talk of worlds that never wereThe end is all that's ever trueThere's nothing you can ever sayNothing you can ever do...'Still every night I burnEvery night I scream your nameEvery night I burnEvery night the dream's the sameEvery night I burnWaiting for my only friendEvery night I burnWaiting for the world to end'Just paint your face,' the shadows smileSlipping me away from you'Oh it doesn't matter how you hideFind you if we're wanting toSo slide back down and close your eyesSleep a whileYou must be tired...'But every night I burnEvery night I call your nameEvery night I burnEvery night I fall againEvery night I burnScream the animal screamEvery night I burnDream the crow black dreamEvery night I burnScream the animal screamEvery night I burnDream the crow black dreamDream the crow black dream...
