You think you're on a rollYour garbage turns to goldTell everyoneYou're going it aloneYou whine and bitch and moanFor another cushion on the throneTell everyoneYou're going it aloneYou've broken every bone you're made ofYou know what you're afraid ofBut you're made of stoneYou're climbing out your holeAnd now you're in controlTell everyoneYou're going it aloneYou've broken every bone you're made ofYou know what you're afraid ofBut you're made of stone (x2)
