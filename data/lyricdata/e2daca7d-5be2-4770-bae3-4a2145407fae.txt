We're stuck in a place so dark, you can hardly seeA manner of matter that splits with the words I breatheAnd as the rain drips acidic questions around meI block out the sight of the powers that beAnd duck away into the darkness, times upI wind up in a rusted world with eyes shutSo tight that it blurs into the world of pretendThen the eyes ease open and it's dark againIn the memory you'll find meEyes burning upThe darkness holding me tightlyUntil the sun rises upListen to the sound, dizzy from the ups and downsAnd nauseated by the polluted rock that's all aroundWatchin' the wheels of cars that passI look past to the last of the light and the long shadows it castsA window grows, captures the eyeAnd cries out a yellow light as it passes me byAnd a young, shadowy figure sits in front of a boxInside a building of rock with antennas on topNow, nothing can stop in this land of the painThe sane lose, not knowing they were part of the gameAnd while the insides change, the box stays the sameAnd the figure inside could bear anybody's nameThe memories I keep are from a time like thenI put on my paper so I could come back to themSomeday I'm hopin' to close my eyes and pretendThat this crumpled up paper can be perfect againFrom the top to the bottom (Bottom to top I stop)At the core I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)Taken far from my safety (The picture's there)The memory won't escape meI'm here at this podium talking, the ceremonial offeringsDedicated to urban dysfunctional offspringWhat's happening?City governments are eternally nappingTrapped in gritty covenants, causin' urban collapsingBullets that scar souls, with dark holds, get more than your car stoleSome hearts be blacker than charcoal for realThis society's deprivation depends, not on our differencesBut the separation withinNo preparation is made, limited aid, and minimum wageLivin' in a tenement cage where rent isn't paidTragedy within a paradeThe darkness overspreads like a permanent plagueI'm the forgottenIn the memory you'll find meEyes burning upThe darkness holding me tightlyUntil the sun rises up
