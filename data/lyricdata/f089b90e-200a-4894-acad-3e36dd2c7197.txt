Go go undergroundAnd now there's a place to go.It's the morning now, its the eveningIt's everything.I click my heels and I'm there.Underground, UndergroundEverything's heavy undergroundUndergroundYou've been kicked around,UndergroundDid life bring you down here?Everything's heavy undergroundWe'll be decked in all blackSlamming the pits fantastic.Officer Friendly's little boy's got a mohawkHe knows just where we're coming from.It's industrial, work it undergroundGet down, get down, get downoh we can't, oh we can't, oh we can't beChorus:oh, we can't, oh we can't, oh we can't be (3x)everything's happy underground, everything's happy underground.
