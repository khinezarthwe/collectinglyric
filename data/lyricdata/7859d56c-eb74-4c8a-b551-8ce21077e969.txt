When I get up I've dreamt too longEverything else is half as strongI could see though, outside my headThey got it right, I got it wrongI've let too much of it slide through my fingersFear that has fouled all the love I could bring herShook off her optimistic handI am too fixed on what I've plannedWho is the one who can't let go?I will miss out, hell, don't I knowI've let too much of it slide through my fingersFear that has fouled all the love I could bring herI've let too much of it slide through my fingersFear that has fouled all the love I could bring herI've let too much of it slide through my fingersFear that has fouled all the love I could bring herI've let too much of it slide through my fingers
