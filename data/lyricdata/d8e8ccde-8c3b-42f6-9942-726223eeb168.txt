Caught here in a fiery blaze, won't lose my will to stayI tried to drive all through the nightThe heat stroke ridden weather, the barren empty sightsNo oasis here to see, the sand is singing deathless words to meCan't you help me as I'm startin' to burn (all alone)Too many doses and I'm starting to get an attractionMy confidence is leaving me on my own (all alone)No one can save me and you know I don't want the attentionAs I adjust to my new sights the rarely tired lights will take me to new heightsMy hand is on the trigger I'm ready to igniteTomorrow might not make it but everything's all rightMental fiction, follow me; show me what it's like to be set freeCan't you help me as I'm startin' to burn (all alone)Too many doses and I'm starting to get an attractionMy confidence is leaving me on my own (all alone)No one can save me and you know I don't want the attentionSo sorry you're not here I've been sane too long my vision's so unclearNow take a trip with me but don't be surprised when things aren't what they seemCaught here in a fiery blaze, won't lose my will to stayThese eyes won't see the same, after I flip todaySometimes I don't know why we'd rather live than dieWe look up towards the sky for answers to our livesWe may get some solutions but most just pass us byDon't want your absolution 'cause I can't make it rightI'll make a beast out of myself, gets rid of all the pain of being a manCan't you help me as I'm startin' to burn (all alone)Too many doses and I'm starting to get an attractionMy confidence is leaving me on my own (all alone)No one can save me and you know I don't want the attentionSo sorry you're not here I've been sane too long my vision's so unclearNow take a trip with me but don't be surprised when things aren't what they seemI've known it from the start all these good ideas will tear your brain apartScared but you can follow me I'm too weird to live but much too rare to die
