Ten years ago, I got a call that nearly killed meRepeat yourself, my hands are shakingWhen I was told, my friend was gone I felt so guiltyA thousand questions left unansweredI'll bleed if you want me to!I'll serenade before I doI'll bleed if you want me, to!On and on although you're gone, candles burn without a flame onOur final call to you, I know you're listeningHow could you leave us that way?Where did you go? (ten years today!)Ten years ago, I stood beside the wood that held youI must sit down, my legs are shakingWe let you go, with gifts of plectrums for your journeyAnd melodies to help you on your wayI'll bleed if you want me to!I'll serenade before I doI'll bleed if you want me, to!On and on although you're gone, candles burn without a flame onOur final call to you, I know you're listeningHow could you leave us that way?Where did you go? (ten years today!)Wh-oh-ah!Wh-oh-ah!Wh-oh-ah!I'll bleed, if you want me to (I'll bleed if you want me to!)I'll bleed if you want me, to!On and on although you're gone, candles burn without a flame onOur final call to you, I know you're listeningHow could you leave us that way?Where did you go? (ten years today!)Where did you go? (ten years today!)Where did you go?How could you leave us that way?Where did you go? (ten years today!)
