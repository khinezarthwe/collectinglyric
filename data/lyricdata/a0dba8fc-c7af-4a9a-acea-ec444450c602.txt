Lately I've been wanderingOff the narrow pathYou've given me so many things that I've never hadAnd all in all I know it's you that always pulls me throughIf you reach deep inside you'll see my heart is true'Cause I hate the way I feel tonightAnd I know I need you in my lifeYes I hate the way I feel insideAnd I promise to make the sacrificeThe world I know is pulling meMore and more each dayI feel like the odd man out as I begin to praySpiteful eyes are watching meWith everything I doIn the midst of darkness LordMy spirit calls for you'Cause I hate the way I feel tonightAnd I know I need you in my lifeYes I hate the way I feel insideAnd I promise to make the sacrificeYou know sometimesDeep insideI feel like this'Cause I hate the way I feel tonightAnd I know I need you in my lifeYes I hate the way I feel insideAnd I promise to make the sacrifice'Cause I hate the way I feel tonightAnd I know I need you in my lifeYes I hate the way I feel insideAnd I promise to make the sacrificeThe way I feel
