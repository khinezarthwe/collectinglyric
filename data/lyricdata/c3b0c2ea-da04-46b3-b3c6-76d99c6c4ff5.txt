I saw my friend the other dayAnd I don't knowExactly just what he becameIt goes to showIt wasn't that long agoThat I was just like youAnd now I think I'm sickAnd I wanna go homeHow have I been, how have you been?It's been so longWhat have you done with all your timeAnd what went wrong?I knew you back whenAnd you, you knew meAnd now I think you're sickAnd I wanna go homeAnybody ever say no?Ever tell you that you weren't right?Where did all the little kid go?Did you lose it in a hateful fight? And you know it's trueIt wasn't that long agoI was just like youAnd now I think I'm sickAnd I wanna go home
