Keely Aimee sat next to meMy hair stood up on endAnd Keely Aimee, maybe one nightWe could be better friendsI know this town's been hard on youI've seen the neighbors close their shadesBut Keely, they've got their secrets tooSo you fell in some mud, you haven't fallen from graceKeely Aimee, I'm sure you dreamed you'd do far greater thingsBut, Keely, I wish you wouldn't dwell on what could and couldn't beI know how dreams can let you downI've had some rude awakeningsBut Keely, I still go back to sleepIn the dead of night you spring to life for meKeely AimeeKeely AimeeKeely Aimee, I know this world is such a heavy weightAnd, Keely Aimee, those crows feet perched at such an early ageWell, I'd help you shoo those birds awayIf the burden's just too muchSee, Keely, I love your suffering like gravity loves a stumbling drunkSo Keely Aimee, lay next to meRest your head against mineIn all of the world I've never known a sadder ValentineAnd when will I sleep and dream of the city towering into the clouds?We'll run through the streets anonymouslyA whole new lifeIf only we knew howKeely AimeeIf only we knew howKeely AimeeOh, no, noIf we knew howIf we knew howIf we knew how
