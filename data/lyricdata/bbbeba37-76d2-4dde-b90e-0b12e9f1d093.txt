Born in the trash - it's the pain that I feelYou men with power - can't you see that I'm realYou call yourself civilized - treat me like a slaveIt feels like I carry - my own cross to the graveYou leave me no chance - to live my own lifeYou force me to live - my life by the knifeAnd up there you sit - you've locked up your doorsChossin' my fate - in the name of the lawI'm alive - but I'm not freeI might as well be deadLife in the trash - beyond all compareLife in the trash - hope's not enough for meYou fight wars with words - and act so politeBut sill you decide - what is good and rightBut don't you forget - that time conquers allUsurers die - and empires fallI'm alive - but I'm not freeI might as well be deadLife in the trash - it's filthy ant meanLife in the trash - only the strong survive.
