Are we nothing more than this?A list of pinnacles achievedAnd I forgot the way to my conscienceI will save this, take you homeA chance to leave the past behindAnd move toward the future brightThis time it's done a better wayBreathe again this timeForget the emotional countdownAnd try to put togetherJust a little bit piece by pieceAre we nothing more than this?
