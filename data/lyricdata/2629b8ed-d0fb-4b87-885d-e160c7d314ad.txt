Little girl, don't be sad, I've set your eyes on fireDon't say I'm a liar, that I don't love youSomething has brought me down but I won't give up hopeIt's hard for you to cope when I'm around youLet the sun break throughThe cracks within my roomThe gray sky fades to blueIt will wash away this gloomAlcohol, company, I need to readjustFrom this place of dust, let's go drink tonightAnd at the bar we'll drink 'til dawn and I'll pretend, I'm deadWhilst resting my poor head by the neon lightLet the sun break throughThe cracks within my roomThe gray sky fades to blueIt might wash away this gloomOh, let the sun break throughThe cracks within my roomThe gray sky fades to blueIt might wash away this gloomThe birds will sing for usWe all die in the endThe birds will sing for usAnd we'll all die in the endThe birds will sing for usThe birds will sing for usThe birds will sing for usBut we all die in the end
