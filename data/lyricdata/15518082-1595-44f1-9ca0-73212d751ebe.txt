Okay stop.Okay start.And please me, I don't care how.Stop me and please me now,Oh, with your mouth.Big bad, big bad ape in a prison room.He's just itching to telephone you,Oh, with his mouth.Behave, behave.I don't know quite how to behave.Patience, patience.Leaves me with a cross to bearLeaves me, I don't know where.Then it leaves me out.Distance, distance.Oh, leaves me, I'm ashamed to say.I make a mess on the stage with my mouth.Behave, behave!I don't know quite how to behave.Behave!I don't have a clue how to behave when I'm around you.Behave around you.Behave around you!
