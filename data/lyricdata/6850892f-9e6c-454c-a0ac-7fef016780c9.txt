You came waltzing inWhere the love had beenAnd the boys all looked aroundLet me stay while you talk your baby downI came waltzing inWhere the light had beenAnd the girls all looked awayLet them stare while we make our getawayYou came waltzing inWhere the light had beenAnd the dark was all aroundLet me stay while they all fall to the groundI was hiding from the weatherShe was recently estrangedWhen she put me back togetherDidn't even know her nameYou came waltzing inWhere the life had beenAnd the death was all aroundLet them stare while they all fall to the groundYou came waltzing inWhere the love had beenAnd the girls all looked awayLet me stay while they make their getawayI was hiding from the weatherShe was recently estrangedWhen she put me back togetherDidn't even know her nameYou came waltzing inWhere your life had beenIt was nowhere to be foundTake me back to the place where we were boundYou came waltzing inWhere the love had beenAnd the boys all looked aroundLet me stay while you talk your baby downI was hiding from the weatherShe was recently estrangedWhen she put me back togetherDidn't even know her name
