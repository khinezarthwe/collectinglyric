We wage wars like Pascal waged wagers,And its on Pascal's wager we send sergeant majors to fight,It would be nice if we took his triangle,And we could find new angles more violent and wonderful,I was thinking of saving the animals,But first we save people (not animals),Just 'cause they're almost as rare as love through marriage,Do you sometimes wish that your siblings were miscarried?And people made evil,We decide what it is and decide what it's not,If you do things illegal,You can be pretty sure that it would be allowed somewhere else,But we're happy people,So there's nothing wrong with the state of things,If it's making you happy,Then there's nothing wrong with the state you're in.We get people that shout down the state,And they demand justice,But justice as fairness or truth;As confused as the next politicianWho tries not to lie in their impossible mission for truth to be toldI think most couldn't cope,With broken relations to absolute nations above;When you think that it's love that you bought,Its no longer a mystery, she was so nice to me.And people made evil,We decide what it is and decide what it's not,If you do things illegal,You can be pretty sure that it would be allowed somewhere else,But we're happy people,So there's nothing wrong with the state of things,If it's making you happy,Then there's nothing wrong with the state you're in.My horse has won; my own son.Well sir, well done. I hope you had fun
