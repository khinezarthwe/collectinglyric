Here I amLaid bare at the end of my ropeI've lost all hope so longMolly Connelly just broke up with meOver the revealing nature of the songsYou goddamned kids had best be gracious with the merch money you spend'Cause for youI won't ever have rough sex with Molly Connelly againHere I amLaid down at the end of my ropeWishing I had not been bornNow I've spewed too muchI can never shut it upI thought you should be warnedI implied black skies took a needle to my eyeSucked out all its glow WhoaohMolly Connelly ruined my lifeI thought the world should know Ho!I can't stop thinkin bout what she did wrong to meJust can't figure out what I did wrongI kill myself thinkin bout things that you do to meMolly ConnellyI can't stop thinkin bout what she did wrong to meJust can't figure out what I did wrongI kill myself thinkin bout things that you do to meMolly Connelly
