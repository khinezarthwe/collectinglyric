Its nine-eight-teenIt's coffee colored eveningThe headlights spin shadows on the ceilingI'm left here with the Gideon BibleLong strands of her hairTrickle down the bedAnd in my soul there's a little AlaskaIt's 80 below and it's droppingSweet Ecclesiastes won't you preach to meCorner store assassion with a Glock 19Coffee makes my hand shakeI'm a running boyIf I were Jack the Ripper would you still kiss me?She's smooth like the girl with the leather-like bondingYou fall into the snow, yeah you make a little AngelAnd I read straight through the book of RevelationsI saw the Astronaus on TV jumping on the moonAnd all the horses that I bet onAre lame and shot through the headand Sweet Ecclesiastes, won't you reach to me?Corner store assassion with a Glock 19Coffee makes my hand shakeI'm a running boyIf I were Jack the Ripper would you still kiss me?
