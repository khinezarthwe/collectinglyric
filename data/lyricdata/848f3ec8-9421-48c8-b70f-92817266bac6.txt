I like apple pieAnd you like banoffeeWe both love shopping for furnitureAnd meeting for coffeeWe pretend we're into art galleries'Cause it makes us feel cleverWe're both in our element when we're on our kneesWhatever the weatherI could be your fag hagAnd you could be my gayI'll never make you feel sadWhen you come out to playI could be your fag hagAnd you could be my gayI'll never make you feel sadWhen you come out to playWe don't give a fuckWhat people are thinkingI know you'll always look out for meWhen we go out drinkingI can ask you things I can't ask anyoneAnd you'll give me directionApart from me, you're the only other person I knowWho reads the travel sectionI could be your fag hagAnd you could be my gayI'll never make you feel sadWhen you come out to playI could be your fag hagAnd you could be my gayI'll never make you feel sadWhen you come out to playI could be your fag hagAnd you could be my gayI'll never make you feel sadWhen you come out to playI could be your fag hagAnd you could be my gayI'll never make you feel sadWhen you come out to play
