Some things fall apartSome things makes you wholeSome things that you findAre beyond your controlI love you and you're beautifulYou write your own songsWhat if the right part of leavingTurned out to be wrongIf I could kiss you nowOh I'd kiss you now again and again'Til I don't know where I beginAnd where you endThought I fell in love the other dayWith an old friend of mineI was running kissesDown every inch of her spineWe had the roof downThe sun came shining inThe black fact isThat I was thinking of youIf I could kiss you nowOh I'd kiss you now again and again'Til I don't know where I beginAnd where you endI slept in the sun the other dayI thought I was fineEverything seemed perfect'Til I had you on my mindI tried to love youI did all that I couldI wish that the bad nowHad finally turned into goodIf I could kiss you nowOh I'd kiss you now again and again'Til I don't know where I beginAnd where you endIf I could kiss you nowIf I could kiss you nowIf I could kiss you nowOh where you endIs where I beginOh where you endOh where you endOh where you end
