One day, when the world is set to rightsI'm going to murder all the people I don't likeThe people who have left me down without reserveThe people who are cruel to those that don't deserveThe people who talk too much, the people who don't careThe people whose lives are going nowhereThe people who just give in, the people who don't fightThe people I don't like.The people who broke my heart so bad it never mendsThe people who wrecked my life and all my so-called friendsThe people who don't know when to forget and forgiveThese are the people who do not deserve to liveThe people who talk too much, the people who don't careThe people whose lives just leave me crying in despairThe people who told me I was wrong and they were rightThe people I don't like.
