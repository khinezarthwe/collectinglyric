Regulars reach for wonders desires，Fed up with rain n forest fires，There's nothing bold enough to say there is nothing at all.These days are going fine， she's not a friend of mine，There's nothing said so sweet，Can anyone hear me?I never wrote these lines see there rise from beyond，See a friend of mine has a gift of song，Delivered well，delivered clear my bird is singing in my ear.I have a gem of a bird，sits in my pocket whispers to me wonderful words，The most magnificent words，She puts the pen and the paper in my hand，says things she does not think I understand，But I know better than her.Envision the position in the lower class den，Think once then think again.Money first then devastationWon't pull these times are changing，These days are going fine you're not a friend of mine，There's nothing said so sweet，Can anyone hear me?I never wrote these lines see there rise from beyond，See a friend of mine has a gift of song，Delivered well， delivered clear my bird is singing in my ear.I have a gem of a bird，sits in my pocket whispers to me wonderful words，The most magnificent words，She puts the pen and the paper in my hands，says things she does not think I understand，But I know better than her.And I tell you there's no one stealing Jupiter from meand I'll tell you there's no one sings in better harmony，No spaces for fickle minds on Kye Kye to fucking disagree.I have a gem of a bird，sits in my pocket whispers to me wonderful wordsThe most magnificent words，She puts the pen and the paper in my hands，says things she does not think I understand，But I know better than her.I have a gem of a bird，sits in my pocket whispers to me wonderful wordsThe most magnificent words，I have a gem of a bird，I have a gem of a bird，But I know better than her.
