I'm playing my guitar while my sister bangs the jarThe glass sets up a sound like people laughingIt's going to my brain and it's easing all my painI must hear this sound again 'cause time is passingMmmI'm walking by the sea and the shingle sings for meThe crabs are swimming down among the starfishThe rocks all clatter down and the seagulls fly aroundBut the whole trip rubs it in that time is passing, passingFind it, I got to hear it all againMy heart has heard the sound of harmonyBlind to it, as my tears fall againIt's only by the music I'll be freeThere's something in the whisper of the treesMillions hear it, still they can't believeThere are echoes of it splashing in the wavesAs an empire of dead men leave their gravesDon't listen to people talk, don't listen to 'em selling soulsDon't listen to me or words from men aboveDon't hear it in your needs and don't hear it in your greedsJust hear it in the sound of time a-passingFind it, I got to hear it all againMy heart has heard the sound of harmonyBlind to it, as my tears fall againIt's only by the music I'll be free
