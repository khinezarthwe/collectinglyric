I tear my heart openI sew myself shutMy weakness is that I care too muchAnd my scars remind meThat the past is realI tear my heart open just to feelI'm drunk and I'm feeling downAnd I just wanna be aloneI'm pissed 'cause you came aroundWhy don't you just go home?'Cause you channeled all your painAnd I can't help you fix yourselfYou're making me insaneAll I can say isI tear my heart openI sew myself shutAnd my weakness is that I care too muchAnd our scars remind usThat the past is realI tear my heart open just to feelI tried to help you onceAgainst my own adviceI saw you going downBut you never realizedThat you're drowning in the waterSo I offered you my handCompassion's in my natureTonight is our last standI tear my heart openI sew myself shutAnd my weakness is that I care too muchAnd our scars remind usThat the past is realI tear my heart open just to feelI'm drunk and I'm feeling downAnd I just wanna be aloneYou should have never come aroundWhy don't you just go home?'Cause you're drowning in the waterAnd I tried to grab your handI left my heart openBut you didn't understandBut you didn't understandGo fix yourself!I can't help you fix yourselfBut at least I can say I triedI'm sorry but I've gotta move on with my own lifeI can't help you fix yourselfBut at least I can say I triedI'm sorry but I've gotta move on with my own lifeI tear my heart openI sew myself shutAnd my weakness is that I care too muchAnd our scars remind usThat the past is realI tear my heart open just to feelI tear my heart openI sew myself shutAnd my weakness is that I care too muchAnd our scars remind usThat the past is realI tear my heart open just to feel.
