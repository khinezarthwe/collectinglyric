I stared at the ceiling to regain some feelingThe days mixed with let downs and come downs and put downsThere's words and their feelings but none of them sit wellYou say that you're happy when no one believes youSo I just take my timeWe're treading deep water and can't seem to come by any placeWhere we can force ourselves to knowWhere is the space in our heads for hopeful thoughts to growSo now I hope you'll rush to my sideA wish can't just choose to fall down by the waysideThere's bees in the atticAcidic with panicBees in the atticAcidic with panicThere's pills straws and bottles for all our bruised feelingsThey mixed well in person but sting when they're leavingSo I will make up my mindWe're treading deep water and can't seem to come by any placeWhere we can force ourselves to growWhere is the space in our heads for hopeful thoughts to growSo now I hope you'll rush to my sideWe've threaded the needle and can't find a way outThere's bees in the atticAcidic with panicBees in the atticAcidic with panic
