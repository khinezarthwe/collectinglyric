It's springtime but I still miss the streets at dawnAnd in the morning walking your bridges homeAs I sit and stare at all of England's soulsI tell you somethingI wish I was in EdinburghI don't mind being by myselfDon't wanta be anywhere elseJust wanna be in EdinburghI wish I was an Edinburgh manYou can leave me on the shelfI'm an Edinburgh man myselfI will always give you helpIt's summertime but I still miss your skies so clearSitting and staring on a beach somewhereI'll tell you somethingI wish I was in EdinburghDon't give a toss about private wealthAnd history just repeats itselfKeep me away from the FestivalAnd just give me a warm quarter-gill*They say you project yourselfBut I'm an Edinburgh man myselfIt's wintertime and i still see the cobble stonesClacking over your streets at dawnI was really poor since I left EdinburghI'm OK just by myselfCause our miserable king won't protect us from ourselvesHow I wish I was in EdinburghHow I wish I was in EdinburghI was always in good healthI'm an Edinburgh man myselfI will always give you helpI'm an Edinburgh man myself
