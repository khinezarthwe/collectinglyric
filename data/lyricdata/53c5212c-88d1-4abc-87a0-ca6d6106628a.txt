Never leave meWalk close beside meYour hand my handFits so easyNo tomorrowLet us stop hereWe did some great thingsOr didn't weDry and dustyI am a capsule of energyYou speak softlyWe are capsules of energyWork as I've been toldIn return I get moneySmall feet in your hallAnd I long for every momentDry and dustyI am a capsule of energyYou speak softlyWe are capsules of energy
