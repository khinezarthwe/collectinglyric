You really let the family downYou almost ruined their nameYour father's so disappointedYour sister feels the sameAnd now the neighbors are talkingEyes down underneath their breatheYour mother I swear you've done thisShe says she's got nothing leftWhy can't you just be normalAnother link in the chainI pull you away like your fatherNot likely were not the same*Chorus*'Cuz were poor innocent boysPoor poorInnocent boysPoor innocent boysPoor poorInnocent boysPoor innocent boysPoor poorInnocent boysPoor innocent boysA tribulation radio station boyDo you notice something missingWhen the kids at playTurn to be the doorman xSet it up and playAll I've got is vices knocking at my doorAll the angry taxman asking me for moreI've got something to sayAll in a matter of timePlease don't get in my way'Cuz everything is mine.*Chorus*x2
