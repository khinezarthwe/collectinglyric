I had a dream last nightYou were thereYou held my hand so tightI thought I'd just dieDo you rememberWhen we use to have so much funI used to cry sometimesThose days are goneDo you remember?I wanna go back toBack to the daysWhen I neededA little more funWhen I believed II believed ICould fly so highThrough the cloudsTear down these wallsIf just for one dayTear down these wallsI need you to stayStay!Come on and stayStayStayTurning back time toTimes we made loveAll dayUnder the sunWhen I believed II believed ICould fly so highThrough the cloudsTear down these wallsIf just for one dayTear down these wallsI need you to stayStay!Come on and stayStayStayI had a dream last night...
