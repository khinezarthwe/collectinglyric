As I walk down the highway all I do is sing this songAnd a train that's passing my way helps the rhythm move alongThere is no doubt about the words are clearThe voice is strong, is oh so strongI'm just a simple guy, I live from day to dayA ray of sunshine melts my frown and blows my blues awayThere's nothing more that I can say but on a day like todayI pass the time away and walk a quiet mile with youAll I need from you is all your loveAll you got to give to me is all your loveAll I need from you is all your loveAll you got to give to me is all your loveOh yeah, oh yeahOh yeah, oh yeahI'm so glad I'm living and gonna tell the world I amI got me a fine woman and she says that I'm her manOne thing that I know for sure gonna give her all the lovingLike nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody canStanding in the noonday sun trying to flag a ridePeople go and people come, see my rider right by my sideIt's a total disgrace, they set the pace, it must be a raceAnd the best thing I can do is runAll I need from you is all your loveAll you got to give to me is all your loveAll I need from you is all your loveAll you got to give to me is all your loveOh yeah, oh yeahOh yeah, oh yeah
