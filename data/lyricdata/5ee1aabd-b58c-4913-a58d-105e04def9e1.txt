Come around for teaDance me round and round the kitchenBy the light of my T.VOn the night of the electionAncient stars will fall into the seaAnd the ocean floor sings her sympathyDrive me miles awayEscape the sky that we lay underOf all the dreams we cannot shakeWe're always shaking in our slumberIn the car don't let me fall asleepI might leave my heart here on your vinyl seatWell the sound of the city's now long goneAnd in the silence of the park and every darkened cinemaFeel the little changes coming onSo come to me where you belongOf all the bright machineryLove's the strangest of inventionsHow could this all just turn on me?When all I wanted was perfectionAnd you areThat's what you are to meYou're the brightest star when all the world's asleepWell the sound of the city's now long goneAnd in the silence of the park and every darkened cinemaFeel the little changes coming onSo come to me where you belongCome to me where you belong
