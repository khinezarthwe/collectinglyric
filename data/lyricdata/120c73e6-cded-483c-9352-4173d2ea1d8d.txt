This is the film close to the third act and the miseryThis isn't rain, you rapist werewolvesThis is God pissing down on youDon't worry, you won't die aloneI'll break off my own arms andSharpen my bones and stab you once for each time I thought of youTrying to take something you'll never be good enoughTo even look uponIt's better to push something when it's slippingThan to risk being dragged downIf you want to hit bottomDon't bother taking me with youAnd I won't answer if you callI'm two heartbeats ahead in HellTrying to break your fallThis isn't a mob, I won't need to changeTo change the namesEveryone around you has murdered someone's something sacredThere isn't one nail without dirt under itThere isn't any "white cotton panties"That aren't soaked and stained redIt's better to push something when it's slippingThan to risk being dragged downIf you want to hit bottomAnd I won't answer if you callI'm two heartbeats ahead in HellTrying to break your fallInto the fireInto the fireInto the fireInto the fireInto the fireInto the fireInto the fireInto the fire
