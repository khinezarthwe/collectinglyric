You say you don't know what love means anymoreSince I found youI'm tearing down the walls without youAnd I'm getting lost in all the plans that I heard you makeAbout the older timesAbout the greater timesOh I don't knowI don't know anywayLook upLook upI'll keep my eyes on youDo you remember when you were a child then?And you laughed when you looked at the moonThere's no meaning anymoreWe're floating in the skyAnd if you think that we are older nowIt's just our heads are butterfliesAre you the one that I've been waiting for?You say you don't know what love means anymoreSince I found youI'm tearing down the walls, the walls, the walls...Are you the one that I've been waiting for?Are you the one that I've been waiting for?
