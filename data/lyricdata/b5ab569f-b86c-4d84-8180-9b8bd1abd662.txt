When I'm in the Mercy Seat I smileAnd lay my weapons downAll I ask is for releaseNo matter what the costThere's only one wayTo bring a new dayApply the heat that gently turnsMy sickness into healthBut you can taste the fire for yourselfYeah, you can taste the fire for yourselfAnd when that blood begins to flowThere's nowhere else to goI feel complete in the Mercy SeatSo complete in the Mercy SeatSo bind me to the Mercy Seat and heal meI promise not to flinchAnd ring that bell as loud as you pleaseIt can only make me wellThere's only one wayTo bring a new dayHelp me to recall I'm just a manAnd that's all I amBut you can taste the fire for yourselfYeah, you can taste the fire for yourselfAnd when that blood begins to flowThere's nowhere else to goI feel complete in the Mercy SeatSo complete in the Mercy SeatSo complete in the Mercy Seat
