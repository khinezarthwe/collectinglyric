It's too late now to rush apartWhen your aching heart wasn't amplifiedAnd if you drain the fluid fromMy screaming lungs I know I'll dieAnd it's hard to know what's rightWhen I'm needing you tonightAnd you're needing me tonightIt's too late now to hold on to the crutchWhen you open arms and open heart you can never hold too muchIf I drain the beauty fromYour bleeding blood I know I'll dieOh, I never tried toBut it's all been doneWe'll hold on tightAnd I will hold on to youAnd the beating blood drives an empty loveWhile I hold on to youAnd oh lord I know it's true
