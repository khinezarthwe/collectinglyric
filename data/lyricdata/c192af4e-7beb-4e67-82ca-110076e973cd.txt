A sky as black as regretIs rolling aside for the blueImpossible face to forgetThese feelings belong in a zooShe brings the morningShe, she brings the morning sunSo lost in the sound of her voiceI don't even hear the wordsWhen she says,She brings the morningShe, she brings the morning sunBut all this an imagined affairWhile sitting in a bar spilling in a barI drink until the doorman is a Christmas treeAnd my speech is just a gas leakShe brings the morningShe, she brings the morning sun
