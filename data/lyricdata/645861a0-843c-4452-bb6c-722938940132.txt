There's a thousand voices in my headLong agoCome inside, see yourself tonightLet me in, floating in the windOh, I don't knowThe sounds you hearAre silent in the nightTake me down to the trail of tearsWhere tomorrow never knowsA resurrection closer to aLight I've never knownPlay the game existence to theLiving end I goTake me down to the trail of tearsWhere tomorrow never knowsThe lost road of destinyI ride away homeHead to lay on velvet nails tonightAnd will I lay down to close my eyesOh, I don't knowSpirit wind with broken wings to fly away home(Repeat chorus)My feet are raw from theTrail where I've beenOh God these tears are evermoreMy heart is goneOh to never come againI'll walk the starsOn my way home(Repeat chorus)
