I see the swords I hear the soundMe commrades falling to the goundWe're fighting til the very endMy mind is hell-bent on revengeStronger than evil no longer a foolStronger than evil too strong for youStronger than evil soldier in commandStronger than evil more powerful than manThe power in my hand is freeShining bright for all to seeYou're rejected all I saidBut it's too late you've expired,Now you're deadOverloaded and loving it allIs something I love to hateCrushing the skulls of those who won'tFollow I can hardly waitRevenge is mine I'll pay you backI'll make you earn you tearsI'm coming back to take what's mineI'll see you in 7 yearsFire waits for those who fallAnd follow not the master's callThe mark upon you forehead ticksBeware the mark is 666
