Sail with meAcross the seaSo we can see what's goin onAlong the wayRed stack the bongWe'll make it tight alrightWe'll write the oneThat makes her cumThe one that makes it so she can't sleep tonightSo bombs away and as they sayHeres to oblivionAnd cheers to youAs well it's throughSound sirenShe's still cryingIt's over, it's overSound sirenIt's over, it's overWe'll have some funPlay with a loaded gunTry not to shoot and kill no oneCause I would feel like shitBut in the same regard it's getting hard to deal with itI'm sick of itAnd no place is too farChorusSo bombs away,And as they sayWell it's over now it's over nowShe's gone, and he won't go awaySo sound sirenShe's still cryingIt's over, it's overSound sirenIt's over, it's over x4
