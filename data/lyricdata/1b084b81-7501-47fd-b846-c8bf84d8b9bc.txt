Here’s a song that finally you can understandA minor statement meant to counteract the blandA list of wraithlike thingsThat quicken the heartJust another song; a faded memoryA raison d’etre for the entire familyI don’t remember it wellI was in love for a spellCopies of Sight and Sound she left lying around on the floorThey said I’d forget her voiceThat’s untrueIt’s just not as sharp as beforeFind some transparent words to give securityAnother vacant smile that says ‘rely on me’No wait – commitment’s a boreWhere have I heard it before?I could have sworn that everything was crystal clearBut I was shackled by a language of ideasA desert has its own rulesOutside the circle it’s cruelCopies of Sight and Sound she left lying around on the floorThey said I’d forget her voiceThat’s untrueIt’s just not as sharp as beforeThe final verse is often meant to tie things upBut in this case my morals have been most corruptI don’t remember it wellI was in love for a spellCopies of Sight and Sound she left lying around on the floorThey said I’d forget her faceThat’s a lie – it’s just not as real as before
