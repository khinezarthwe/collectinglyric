(There is nothing better)(Than being with you)(And I'm feeling so nice)(Feeling so nice)Take the beautiful sting of a ScorpioA careless smile and it begins to snowAnd it hurts me to thinkThat you might never knowThat I've got this thing about youIn case you don't understandThere's something else I meant to tell youCHORUSThere is nothingBetter than being with youAnd I'm feeling so niceThere is nowhereBetter than here with youAnd it's feeling so niceStaying up with the MoonAnd walking home in the rainMixed with your perfumeAnd never twice the sameI got a lot to loseBut everything to gainWhen I really think about itYou haven't got a clueIt's all that I can do to hide itCHORUSDid I already say?'Cause you make me forgetI might as well be brave and tell yaNow, it hurts me to think thatYou might never knowWill it hurt as much being true?I might as well be brave and tell yaCHORUSThere is nothingBetter than being with youAnd I'm feeling so niceYeah, I'm feelingAnd it's feeling so nice
