Another night with open eyesToo late to sleep, too soon to riseYou're short of breath, is it a heart attack?Hot and feverish you face the factYou're in love, and it feels like shameBecause she's gone and made a fool of you in public againYou're in love, and it feels like painBecause you know there's too much truth in everything she claimsSo ask yourself now: Can you forgive herIf she wants you to?Ask yourself: Can you even deliverWhat she demands of you?You drift into the strangest dreamsOf youthful follies and changing teamsAdmit you're wrong, oh, no, not yetThen you wake up and remember that you can't forgetShe's made you some kind of laughing stockBecause you dance to disco, and you don't like rockShe'd make fun of you, and even in bedSaid she was gonna go and get herself a real man insteadSo ask yourself now: Can you forgive herIf she begs you to?Ask yourself: Can you even deliverWhat she demands of you?Or do you want revenge?But that's childish, so childish!(But that's childish, so childish!)Remember when you were more easily ledBehind the cricket pavilion and the bicycle shedTrembling as your dreams came trueYou looked right into those blue eyes and knewIt was love, and now you can't pretendYou've forgotten all the promises of that first friendIt's bad enough, she knows how you feelBut she's not prepared to share you with the memorySo ask yourself now: Can you forgive herIf she begs you to?Ask yourself: Can you even deliverWhat she demands of you?Ask yourself now: Can you forgive herIf she begs you to?And ask yourself: Can you even deliverWhat she demands of you?Or do you want revenge?But that's childish, so childish!
