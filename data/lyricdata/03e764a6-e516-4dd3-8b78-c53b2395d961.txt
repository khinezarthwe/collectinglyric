The time is close now, the end is nearMy walk through the valley, trails of fearI feel empty, my penance overdue, I guess it's too late nowTo be with youI'm extremely frightened of what will surely beI sold myself, the death of meI know you can't forgive meI know I'm on my own, I've betrayed youI walk aloneWhat exactly is the meaning of thisJust pawns in your twisted gameSevere pain for the lie I'm livin'For a love I never could betrayBridgeQuestion me not say the lord unto theeYou have chosen your own fate and your own destinyDenied of this life is what you are to beYou have chosen your own fate and your own destinyLord I pound my fists at youWon't you just let me dieWould I not suffer enoughNo inner peace no after lifeRepeat BridgeI did what I thought was rightAll for the love of my lifeI know it's sad but trueSomething is very wrongCondemned to suffer so longFor a love so trueThe question that lies withinIs so hard to understandIt still tears at meAnd in my dying breathMy heart holds no regretsI wouldn't change a thingMy spirit begins to rise into the heavenly skiesJust to be shunned away by youNow all I want is to die, no streets of gold in the skyAnd I wash my hands of youBridgeRising to the heavens lightJust to plea for deathJust to be denied-
