You lived a time of lies until you told me everythingI hope we make amends, but you don'tLife taught you how to fly and then you flew away from meYou left me haunted, star the ending image of the one'Cuz they're still in you too lowAll the voices you don't knowAnd they're still in you too lowAll the choices that you choseYou harbored all the wasted sighs to define the quiet droneI'll let you start again, but you won'tI saw you pray for change and then you walked all over meYou wanted what you could not have and now you are alone'Cuz they're still in you too lowAll the voices you don't knowAnd they're still in you too lowAll the choices that you chose(Make the voices tell me who you are and who I am to be)Are you alone where you are tonight?I'm alone when you're right hereBut I'm still in you somehowI never left at allNow I'm stealing you too lowSo my voice is all you know'Cuz they're still in you too lowAll the voices you don't knowAnd they're still in you too lowAll the choices that you choseLeave you nothing left to holdWhen you're nothing it's a good time to remind you of one thingThe pursuit begins when this portrayal of life...ends
