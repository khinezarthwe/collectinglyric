Stephanie stares at the posters on the wallTina sits and waits for a telephone callMaxine mixes alcohol with polythene and paintSylvia stays in bed on her ownShe can hear the cars outside and wonders where they goAnd if you call her answerphone she'll get back to you one dayAnd lonely girls lonely girls fill the worldOh Julia dreams while she's typing awayJackie kills time while the company paysTracy still hears 808s ringing in her brainJane slaps paint on the walls of her homeLydia sings when she thinks she's aloneJean gets drunk and wanders home through the car parks that eat her changeYeah lonely girls lonely girls fill the worldAnd they smile through the summerAnd laugh in the rainAnd sing through the winterBut never show the painOh sometimes our lives are not what they seemSometimes things aren't like they are in lifestyle magazinesWe see what we want to seeIn this miracle of clayWhere lonely girls lonely girls fill the world
