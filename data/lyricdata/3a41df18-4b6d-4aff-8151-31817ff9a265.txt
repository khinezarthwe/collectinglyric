Instincts that can still betray us, a journey that leads to the sunSoulless and bent on destruction, a struggle between right and wrongYou take my place in the showdown, I'll observe with a pitiful eyeI'd humbly ask for forgiveness, a request well beyond you and IHeart and soul, one will burnHeart and soul, one will burnAn abyss that laughs at creation, a circus complete with all foolsFoundations that lasted the ages, then ripped apart at their rootsBeyond all this good is the terror, the grip of a mercenary handWhen savagery turns all good reason, there's no turning back, no last standHeart and soul, one will burnHeart and soul, one will burnExistence well what does it matter? I exist on the best terms I canThe past is now part of my future, the present is well out of handThe present is well out of handHeart and soul, one will burnHeart and soul, one will burnOne will burn, one will burnHeart and soul, one will burn
