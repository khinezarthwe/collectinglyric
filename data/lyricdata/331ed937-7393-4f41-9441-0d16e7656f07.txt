The flag that I once planted as a king I abandonedAnd now I reclaim this banner by God my sword and my nameIn a truce sealed by blood within this metal skin and all that I ownBlood, bone, and courage in my veins and the heart that pumps itDrink from the chalice and be rebornAnd the land with me, it will change and transformA fighting man sworn to the quest it is the doom of man that they forgetI have awoken the dragon and all around me the mist of his breathGood and evil, there never is one without the other, his brotherAlways there where I least expect it, it will burn me to cindersThe futures taken root in the present sunDon't look into my heart, least of all your ownNo man who is false can win in combat against the truthWhen he lies he murders some part of the world, we must find what was lostHearth and home, wife and child were not for me, I was not yet doneI never knew how empty my soul was until it was refilledMad distemper strikes both beggars and KingsThe Necromancer's hard teachings of war and questI am given the right to bear arms and power to meet justiceI have lived through others for far too long,And carried my guilt, my causes, my sinsI hope in the hereafter when I owe no more to the futureThat I can be just a man
