It's late and I'm awakeStaring at the wallOpen up my windowHead floats out the doorNo one else aroundThe shimmer takes my eyeI lift my headBlinded by the skyFeel my weight in frontFollowing the soundMoves away so fastFall down to the groundI know there's more to comeJump back to my feetNow I only see ahead of meChasing down the streetGave my love to a shooting starBut she moves so fastThat I can't keep upI'm chasingI'm in love with a shooting starBut she moves so fastWhen she falls thenI'll be waiting
