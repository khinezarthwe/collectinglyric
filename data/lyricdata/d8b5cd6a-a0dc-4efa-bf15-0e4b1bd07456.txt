Sitting in todayWatching traffic passing byAnd faces nosing in.A victim of regretIt glitters then it fades awayLike silver turning grey.Washed it all awayWaiting for this dream to endBefore it sucks me in.I'm climbing highUp above the streets and rows of neon lights,I'm holding out my hand but I'm aloneWish I could show you,Wish you could see through my eyes.Tomorrow shines throughBut I'm missing yesterday,Crashing on the groundThe silence seems to suffocateAnd bury me again.Waiting for a tasteOf happiness to lift me freeAnd carry me away.I'm climbing highUp above the streets and rows of neon lightsI know it's just a dream but I'm alive.Wish I could show you,Wish you could see through my eyes.Tomorrow shines through,But I'm missing yesterday,I'm still missing yesterday.Lost another weekFeeling like a leper inA world of vanity.It's killing me todayAddiction pulls you down you know,And she's the drug I need.Wish I could show you,Wish you could see through my eyes.Tomorrow shines through,But I'm missing yesterday.Wish I could show you,Wish you could see through my eyes.Tomorrow shines through,But I'm missing yesterday.
