When everything is lost  (Peel this all away)Haunting us with questions  (Asking)Will we, ever find the smile inside  (No)Is it hidden, behind the sweating eyes (Bleeding)Dead inside a scream that's pouring from me!I'm planted in this skin  (Constricting and pulling me)This dirty filthy skin  (Rancid and stinging me)I burn behind the walls (That have become my world)The bearer of a gift... Fuck your gift!Truth does not exist, but the lies doTruth does not exist, but the lies doThey're buried in the skin... EvolvedPerversion of a truth, I'll start there(Inside of life... Buried in me, why?)  Alone...Born into a world, never asked to be here(Try to forget: Truth doesn't exist!  Truth!)(It doesn't exist, it doesn't exist... Truth!... Ahh!)Always inside a tragedy  (Things never seem to go away)A room that I remember  (Portraits I carry)Try letting go of this space  (Bad habits can't kick me)The fool that fell from Heaven... Heaven!Perversion of a truth, I'll start there(Inside of life... Buried in me, why?)  Alone...Born into a world, never asked to be here(Try to forget: Truth doesn't exist!  Truth!)(It doesn't exist, it doesn't exist... Truth!)(It doesn't exist, it doesn't exist... Truth!)(It doesn't exist, it doesn't exist... Truth!)(It doesn't exist, it doesn't exist... Truth!)(It doesn't exist, it doesn't exist... Truth!)Maybe we're all the children of a starMisguided in direction, misdirectionPardon me while I pray for light!I'm not the only one,That walks between the rain, there are many!I'm not the only one,When everything is lost, that doesn't surrender!Perversion of a truth, I'm stuck there(Inside of life... Buried in me, why?)  Alone...Blind-walking through a world, never asked to be hereVersions of the truth... I'm not the only one!Your versions of the truth are not the only one!Your versions of the truth are not the only one!Your versions of the truth are not the only one!Lies! Lies! Lies! Lies! Lies!Lies!
