Save your breath, don't waste your timeI can tell what's on your mindNo need to mention what we both knowIt's quite a time you picked to tell meIt's quiet time and mostly lonelyAnd now it's time to save the past we know so wellIt's not funnyWe're not laughing like we did beforeAnd it's not funnyIt's just hurting more and moreTake your time to figure outIt's not that plain to seeAnd if you need someone to blameThan you can blame it all on meIt's not the time you picked to tell meIt's more the way you want to show meAnd that's all fineIt's not funnyWe're not laughing like we did beforeAnd it's not funnyIt's just hurting more and moreYou never told meYou never showed meAnd now we're running back and forth between two linesAnd now all the little things are no concern at allSay what you want,We know that it's true (all brand new)Now that we're older now, seems like it's all brand newAnd we've never heard it before
