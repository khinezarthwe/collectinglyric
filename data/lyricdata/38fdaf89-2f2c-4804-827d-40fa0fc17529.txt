(I hate you)Call my nameAnswer me where I standCall my nameAnswer me where I standHere's a story of the way I wasn't meant to be raisedBright yellow sun that fades away to black and blue every placeThere's a bottle in the shape of your love for meNow the clouds are twisting higher blinding arrows awayPiercing the darkness of these streets with my electricityCold shatters the skyThis is the first day of the rest of our lives'Cause no one truly lives or diesCall my name(When did this storm begin?)Answer me where I standCall my name(When will this story end?)Answer me where I standEvery night you drink the money left to pay all the billsNo food for us but there's another fucking bottle of pillsHere's your trophy on my face, it's just an eye anywayNow the clouds are twisting higher blinding arrows awayPiercing the darkness of these streets with my electricityThis will go no further. I swear it dies todayYour nights will stay forever if you dare once more touch meCall my name(When did this storm begin?)Answer me where I standCall my name(When will this story end?)Answer me where I standWhere I stand*girl cries*Call my name(When did this storm begin?)Call my name(When will this story end?)Call my name(When did this storm begin?)Call my name
