We were going through the harbor, going faster than the windA perfect match between the man and the machineUnderneath the surface, love's as cold and blueAnd you're saying this town is not made for youStars getting closer, going through the nightNo one can reach us when we're out of sightTime's running faster, please let us throughGoing in any direction will doAnd you said to me, is that what it was all aboutAnd I said noYou wouldn't take no for an answer, saying colder than the windYour lack of tears is the perfect hintDon't you try to say it 'cause no words will doWe were communicating through the stereoStars getting closer, going through the nightNo one can reach us, no we're out of sightTime's running faster, please let us throughGoing in any direction will doAnd you said to me, is that what it was all aboutAnd I said noOut on the coast where lovers sinI wait for ships that won't come inLove is the most that I can bearI was the fact you made it clearCome out tonight; my halo's near, the coast is clearI'm out of time, speed out of sight, don't leave me hereTides don't last forever, don't you know?
