Yesterday young and freeYour first kissYou gave it all to meNow I'm holding all my gold for freeSudden dream a small thingMakes me laugh and it makes me singNever knew what this love would bringNow you have turned all my winters springNow I'm changing all my lonelinessI'm changing it all for happinessAnd I can feel this emptiness slowly fade awayJust one look in your eyesMy best friendYou just make me flyAnd I never want to end this flightNow I'm - I'm riding on my own king tide (x2)
