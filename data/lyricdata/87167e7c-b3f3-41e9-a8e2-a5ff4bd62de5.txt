Someday you'll hear my cryThe lonesome nightingaleParched to palm this broken branchMy love has now set sailCome sing with me a melodyIn the dark of the nightEvery time I close my eyesThe sun appears againHigh above this broken branchWill these wings ever mend?Come sing with me a melodyIn the dark of the nightCome far away to nightingale'sMake everything all rightI can hear the morning countShe lifts her weary headHigh above this broken dreamTo me her arms extendCome sing with me a melodyIn the dark of the nightCome far away to nightingale'sMake everything all right
