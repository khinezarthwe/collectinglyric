Caroline laughs and it's raining all dayShe loves to be one of the girlsShe lives in the place in the side of our livesWhere nothing is ever put straightShe turns herself 'round and she smiles and she says"This is it, that's the end of the joke"And loses herself in her dreaming and sleepAnd her lovers walk through in their coatsShe's pretty in pinkIsn't she?Pretty in pinkIsn't she?All of her lovers all talk of her notesAnd the flowers that they never sentAnd wasn't she easy?Isn't she pretty in pink?The one who insists he was first in the lineIs the last to remember her nameHe's walking around in this dress that she woreShe is gone but the joke's the samePretty in pinkIsn't she?Pretty in pinkIsn't she?Caroline talks to you softly sometimesShe says, "I love you" and too muchShe doesn't have anything you want to stealWell, nothing you can touchShe waves, she buttons your shirtThe traffic is waiting outsideShe hands you this coatShe gives you her clothes, these cars collidePretty in pinkIsn't she?Pretty in pinkIsn't she?
