They're pacing Piccadilly in packs againAnd moaning for the mercy of a never come rainThe sun's had enough and the simmering skyHas the heave and the hue of a woman on fireShop shutters rattle down and I'm cutting the crowdAll scented and descending from the satellite townsThe neon is graffiti singing make a new startSo I look for a plot where I can bury my broken heartNo, I know I won't forget youBut I'll forget myself if the city will forgive meThe man on the door has a head like MarsLike a baby born to the doors of the barsAnd surrounded by steam with his folded armsHe's got that urban genie thing going onHe's so mercifully free of the pressures of graceSaint Peter in satin, he's like Buddha with maceHe's so mercifully free of the pressures of graceSaint Peter in satin, he's like Buddha with maceNo, I know I won't forget youBut I'll forget myself if the city will forgive meNo, I know I won't forget youBut I'll forget myself if the city will forgive meDo you move through the room with a glass in your handThinking too hard about the way you standAre you watching them pair off and drinking 'em long?Are you falling in love every second song?Do you move through the room with a glass in your hand?Thinking too hard about the way you standAre you watching them pair off and drinking them long?Are you falling in loveAre you falling in loveAre you falling in love every second song?No, I know I won't forget youBut I'll forget myself if the city will forgive meNo, I know I won't forget youBut I'll forget myself and the city will forgive me
