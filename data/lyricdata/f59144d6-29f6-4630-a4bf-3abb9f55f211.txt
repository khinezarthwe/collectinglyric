Two black lines streaming out like a guidance linePut one foot on the road now where the cyborgs are drivingWith the WD40 in their veinsThe screeching little brakes complainWith the briefcase empty and the holes in my shoesI try to stay friendly for the sugary abuseSo tell my secretary now to hold on to my callsI believe i can hear through these wallsOh please save me, save me from myselfI cant be the only one stuck on the shelfYou said you'd always fall for the underdogWell I've been dreaming of jetstreams and kicking up dustA thirty seven thousand fool of wonderlustAnd with skyline number 9 ticked off in my mindOh can't you hear me screaming out now through the telephone lineOh please save me, save me from myselfI cant be the only one stuck on the shelfYou said you'd always fall for the underdogSave me, save me, save me...
