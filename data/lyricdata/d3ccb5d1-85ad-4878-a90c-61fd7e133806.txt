Uncover the veiled shadowsLet it seep throughout embrace the stateLight through darkness still shines throughPurely easier to let complicateRevive a dormant spiritSpill over darkened shadesUnder quickness awakenedThis balance will never fadeDetach from crippling divisionsFeel outside your skinFind empowerment and illuminationTaken entirely from withinAmplified in crouching low lightExperience grounds outside yourselfStand up embrace this nightIt still shelters assembled starsWhat comes from the source of lightAnd all that is opposingScratches in and breaks downThe torn theme of self-loathingHow much deeper can this reachGuess it all depends on the source of lightRevive, awaken but we give in tonight
