"We want information... information... information...Who are you?The new number twoWho is number one?You are number sixI AM NOT A NUMBER!!! I AM A FREE MAN!!!HAHAHAHAHA"I'm on the run, I kill to eat,I'm starving now, feeling dead on my feet.Going all the way, I'm nature's beast.Do what I want, I do as I please.Run, fight, to breathe, it's tough.Now you see me, now you don't.Break the walls, I'm coming out.Not a prisoner, I'm a free man,And my blood is my own now.Don't care where the past was,I know where I'm going...out.If you kill me, it's self defence.If I kill you, then I call it vengeance.Spit in your eye, I will defy.You'll be afraid when I call out your name.Run, fight, to breathe, it's gonna be tough.Now you see me, now you don't.Break the walls, I'm coming out.Not a prisoner, I'm a free man,And my blood is my own now.Don't care where the past was,I know where I'm going.I'm not a number, I'm a free man,I'll live my life how i want to.You'd better scratch mefrom your black book,'Cause I'll run rings around you.Not a prisoner, I'm a free man,And my blood is my own now.Don't care where the past was,I know where I'm going.Not a number, I'm a free man,I'll live my life how i want to.You'd better scratch mefrom your black book,'Cause I'll run rings around you.Not a prisoner, I'm a free man,And my blood is my own now.Don't care where the past was,I know where I'm going.
