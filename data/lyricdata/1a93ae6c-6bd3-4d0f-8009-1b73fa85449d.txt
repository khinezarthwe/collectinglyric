I, once upon a timeCarried a burden insideI sung a last goodbyeA broken rhyme I had underlinedThere's an ocean of sorrow in youA sorrow in meI saw a movement in their eyesThat said I no longer knew the wayI had given up the ghostA passive mind submit to fearAnd the wait for redemption at handWaiting to failFailing againIf death should take me nowCount my mistakes and let me throughWhisper in my earYou have taken more than we've receivedAnd the ocean of sorrow is you
