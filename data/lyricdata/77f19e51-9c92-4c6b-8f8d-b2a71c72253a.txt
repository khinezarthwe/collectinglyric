Deep one perfect morningAs the sun is heading up into the skyAnd I'm sitting here warmingTo the coldness of the things that meet my eyeSomething in me's stirringAnd the moon and all the stars fail to complyAnd my thoughts are turning backwardsAnd I'm picking at the piecesOf a world that keeps turningThe screws into my mindSomething in me's chillingAnd nothing in me's willingTo focus my attention on the skyPast the weakened eyesThat feel and scream into your soulBetter to paint my hate on the wallsBefore the picture goesAnd my thoughts are turning backwardsAnd I'm picking at the piecesOf a world that keeps turningThe screws into my mindAnd I can see a wide world for me to tameI can see a wide world for me to tameFor me to tame, for me to tameFor me to tame, for me to tame
