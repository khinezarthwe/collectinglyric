Are you ready kids?Doo dah doo doo!Now slap your hands.Now spread those wings.Doo dah doo doo!Feather yo bangs.Shake yo buns, that's nice.Now think about your dad.What's your dad like?I wanna meet that dad.Doo dah doo doo!Now smile at the moon.love that moon.Have a glass of wine.It's okay kids, I won't tell.Now lick your lips, turn me on now.Make a doo doo.Do it kids!Make a doo doo.Doo dah doo doo!Slap ya face.Slap your friend.Get sexy kids.Doo dah doo doo!Stinks in here, smells like meat, rotten meat.Kids why would you bring that rotten meat in here of all places?Kids you stupid motherfuckers,What the hell's wrong with you kids.lyrics by tim heidecker and eric wareheim
