Upon the sand, upon the bayThere is a quick and easy way, you sayBefore you illustrateI'd rather stateI'm not the man you think I amI'm not the man you think I amAnd Sorrow's native sonHe will not smile for anyoneAnd pretty girls make gravesEnd of the pier, end of the bayYou tug my arm and say: "Give in to lustGive up to lust..Oh heaven knows we'll soon be dust.."I'm not the man you think I amI'm not the man you think I amAnd Sorrow's native sonHe will not rise for anyoneAnd pretty girls make gravesI could have been wild and I could have been freeBut Nature played this trick on meShe wants it nowAnd she will not waitBut she's too roughAnd I'm too delicateThen on the sandAnother man, he takes her handA smile lights up her stupid face(and well, it would..)I lost my faith in womanhoodI lost my faith in womanhoodI lost my faith...
