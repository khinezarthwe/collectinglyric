Chilled to the bone and five miles to homeI'm messing in the dark and feeling all aloneI got ice in my fire got the heat in my wireInject a little heat I'm burning up the tyresSidewalkingTalking like I'm on and I'm the only oneI'm making like I'm done and staring like a gunSidewalkingAnd I got to get a carAnd I got to get a rideGotta get a carGot jesus on my sideMessing in the dark and walking all alone inThe streetsKnow just where I'm goingSidewalkingChilled to the boneHotwired heat all the way home
