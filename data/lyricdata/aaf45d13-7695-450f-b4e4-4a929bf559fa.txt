Just wanna know yaJust wanna talk to yaI wanna hear about your dayI'd never leave yaNever be mean to yaI'd always let you get your way(chorus)Something good will come our wayAnd maybe this good thing's gonna happen todayIf I were honestI'd tell you everythingBut it keeps coming out as liesIts' not a promiseIn case your wonderingIt's not some blessing in disguise(chorus)x2I know romance is not in fashionAnd my heart is on the lineIf you would be so kindTo help me kill some timeThen something good just might come crashingFrom the stars that light the skyIf you would be so kindTo help me kill some timeJust wanna know yaJust wanna talk to yaI wanna hear about your dayI'd never leave yaNever be mean to yaI'd always let you get your way(chorus)x4
