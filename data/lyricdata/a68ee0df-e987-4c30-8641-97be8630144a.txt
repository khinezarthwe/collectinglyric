Without giving anything awayI can say it's by the seaIt's a house that used to beThe home of a friend of mineWithout giving anything awayWe find ships inside of bottlesWhen the garden's overgrownThe house is white, but the paint is coming offI didn't know if you wanted toBut I came to pick you upYou didn't even hesitateAnd now you and me are on our wayI think I've bought everything we needDon't look back, don't think of theOther places you should've beenIt's a good thing that you came along with meGold in the air of summerYou'll shine like gold in the air of summerYou'll shine like gold in the air of summerYou'll shine like gold in the air of summer
