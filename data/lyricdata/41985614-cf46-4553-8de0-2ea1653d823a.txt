Back then I had a Buckingham rabbitI'd been lonely since she found ChristNow is the time to depend on the lawThe nights of my professional lifeIt's the nights of my professional lifeI was living in a very young cityGrand piano, great lakes goodbyeIf you ask me my name, it's high-low-jack in the gameI can track a single bee to the hiveEvery single game was a blowoutAnd the NASCAR blurred into pornScenic this, scenic that, don't fall for the trapsOf the man who was never bornThe man who was never bornAnd so the rent became whiskeyAnd then my life became riskyAnd so the rent became whiskey, whiskeyShattered dogs on the rocksAt the back of the bar there's a couchWhere the lonely people go and lieThey talk to the honky tonk psychiatristInto the wee hours of the nightInto the wee hours of the nightThe factory's on muscle relaxersThe pine perfume of hilltown floorsThe lover, the thinker, the talker, the singerWon't be lucid for her anymoreWon't be lucid for her anymoreAnd so the rent became whiskeyAnd then my life became riskyAnd so the rent became whiskey, whiskeyShattered dogs on the rocks, shattered dogs on the rocksWhen you know how I feel I feel betterWhen you're fifteen you want to look poorYou do unto others and run like a motherI don't want to look poor anymoreNo, I don't want to look poor anymoreJesus in a runaway shelterSaid "The deaf have pictures of you"From the digital fountains to the analog mountainsLet the mirror express the roomLet the mirror express the room
