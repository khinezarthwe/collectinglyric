Ruby NightsThe last that I sawWith eyes filled with rainA waterfall of goldIt flickered on his face(flickered on his face)He rode to the summitAnd waited at the bridgeI waved him goodbyeHe vanished o'er the ridge(vanished o'er the ridge)My face to the heavensI waited for a signBut only cloudy demons were circling in the sky(circling in the sky)I cried to the riverI cried to the rainI begged the ruby nightTo bring my love again(bring my love again)*interlude*The calling of the tuneThe slowing of the sunInto the ruby nightA game we will be won(game we will be won)
