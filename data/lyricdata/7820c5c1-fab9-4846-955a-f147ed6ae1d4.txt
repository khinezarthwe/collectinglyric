I was driving down the highway my music playing loudI drove into a truckstop stepped up feelin' proudThe stupid gas attendant said "stop that fucking row"There's always someone somewhere who'll try and turn you downSo if you need some action and nothing comes aroundDon't call the doctor turn up the soundPlay it loudIn your neighbourhoodPlay it loudIn your neighbourhoodI was lying on the beach taking the raysListening to Deep Purple reminiscing of old daysI was hassled by a lifeguard so I kicked him to the groundThere's always someone somewhere who'll try and turn you downSo if you need some action and nothing comes aroundDon't call the doctor turn up the soundPlay it loudIn your neighbourhoodPlay it loudIn your neighbourhoodI'm sick of people saying our music is too loudThey never stop complaining, try to turn us downBut if you want it louder we'll turn it up full blastThey'll never stop the music they're living in the pastSo if you need some action and nothing comes aroundDon't call the doctor turn up the soundPlay it loudIn your neighbourhood[Repeat to end]
