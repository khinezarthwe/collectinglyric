Crazy but I'm relieved this timeBegging for sweet relief of blessing in disguiseDying behind these tired eyesI've been losing sleepPlease come to meTonightHands on a miracleI got my hands on a miracleBelieve it or not, hands on a miracleAnd there ain't no wayLet you take it awayEverything that we survivedIt's gonna be alrightJust lucky we're aliveGot no vision I've been blindSearching everywhere you're right here in my sightsHands on a miracleI got my hands on a miracleBelieve it or not, hands on a miracleAnd there ain't no wayLet you take it awayHands on a miracleI got my hands on a miracleBelieve it or not, hands on a miracleI got my hands on a miracleAnd there ain't no wayLet you take it awayTake it away
