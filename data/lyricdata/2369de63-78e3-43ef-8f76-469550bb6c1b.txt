I like pleasure spiked with painAnd music is my aeroplaneIt's my aeroplaneSongbird sweet and sour JaneAnd music is my aeroplaneIt's my aeroplanePleasure spiked with painThat motherfucker's always spiked with painLooking in my own eyes, hey, LordI can't find the love I wantSomeone better slap meBefore I start to rustBefore I start to decomposeLooking in my rear view mirrorLooking in my rear view mirrorI can make it disappearI can make it disappear! Have no fear!I like pleasure spiked with painAnd music is my aeroplaneIt's my aeroplaneSongbird sweet and sour JaneAnd music is my aeroplaneIt's my aeroplanePleasure spiked with painThat motherfucker's always spiked with painSitting in my kitchen hey girlI'm turning into dust againMy melancholy babyThe star of Mazzy mustPush her voice inside of meI'm overcoming gravityI'm overcoming gravityIt's easy when you're sad to beIt's easy when you're sad... sad like me!I like pleasure spiked with painAnd music is my aeroplaneIt's my aeroplaneSongbird sweet and sour JaneAnd music is my aeroplaneIt's my aeroplanePleasure spiked with painJust one noteCould make me floatCould make me float awayOne note fromThe song she wroteCould fuck me where I layJust one noteCould make me chokeOne note that's not a lieJust one noteCould cut my throatOne note could make me dieI like pleasure spiked with painAnd music is my aeroplaneIt's my aeroplaneSongbird sweet and sour JaneAnd music is my aeroplaneIt's my aeroplaneThat's spiked with painIt's my aeroplaneIt's my aeroplaneIt's my aeroplaneIt's my aeroplaneIt's my aeroplaneIt's my aeroplaneIt's my aeroplaneIt's my aeroplaneIt's my aeroplane
