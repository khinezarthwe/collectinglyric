Eyes are looking very far awayInside we're moving for a place awayBut it's no use todayI am looking for a heart to takeInside I'm bleeding for a chance to makeBut there's no use todayIf I don't live it downI am looking for a heart to makeInside I'm moving for a place to stayWhat's the use today?I am looking for a heart to takeInside I'm bleeding for a chance to makeBut it's no use todayIf you tear it downThat's all you knowIf you kick him in the guts it won't goBut if you look me in the eyes I won't knowAnd I will tear it down
