Illustrations on me, animation for youStories on my body, always comin' trueYou ask if I'm insane, pictures of painYour stare I wearYou ask what they mean, they seem obseneSo uncleanSit a while and watch my friendTell a story or two within my skinA thousand times the need I did undergo, head to toeMy flesh has made an outcast of me, my strife, scarred for lifeSit down children, as my life unfoldsMy body moves coldIllustrations on me, animation on youStories on my body, always comin' true
