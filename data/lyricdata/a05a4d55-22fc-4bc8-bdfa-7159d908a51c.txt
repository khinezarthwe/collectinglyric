When the siren's flash is goneAnd we're left to carry onAll the memories are too fewWhen the pastor's music playsAnd that casket rolls awayI could live again if youJust stay alive for mePlease stay now, you left me here alone - it's the end of the linePlease stay I can't make it on my ownMake it on my own - woh,oh,oh,oh,oh,oh,oh,oh,ohIt's the end of the lineNow that you are dead and goneAnd I'm left to carry onI could never smile cause youWon't stay alive for mePlease stay now, you left me here alone - it's the end of the linePlease stay I can't make it on my own - it's the end of the lineMake it on my ownIt's the end of the lineFinally,Your final resting dayIs without meI weepAnd think of brighter daysWhat about me?You can't take back, the one mistakeThat still lives on after life it takesIn that one day, that changed our livesAnd bitter memories are left behindYou can't take back, the one mistakeThat still lives on after life it takesIn that one day, that changed our livesAnd bitter memories are left behindPlease stay now, you left me here alone - it's the end of the linePlease stay I can't make it on my own - it's the end of the lineMake it on my ownIt's the end of the linePlease stay now, you left me here alone - it's the end of the linePlease stay I can't make it on my own - it's the end of the lineMake it on my ownIt's the end of the line
