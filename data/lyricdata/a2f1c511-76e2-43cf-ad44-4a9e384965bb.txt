Picked up the paper this morningCould not believe what I sawA friend of mine was killedRunnin' from the lawI could still see the face of my old friendIn the picture that stared back at meAnd through the tears I went back through the years to rememberThe times that we werePlayin' pirates in the school yard, singin'Soldiers in the fieldsWe were dreamin'Brothers in blood 'til the very endWe were best of friendsBest of friendsAlways hang together, foreverThought we'd always be that wayBut in time you grow upAnd you slip awayIt was thirteen years since I'd seen himThis man that I no longer knewHis mother, god bless herAsked me if I'd say a word or twoLookin' out in a room full of strangersI didn't know quite what to sayAll I could tell was of two old friendsAnd some long gone summer days ofPlayin' pirates in the school yard, singin'Soldiers in the fieldsWe were dreamin'Brothers in blood 'til the very endFriends like him don't come very oftenYou never treasure them while there's timeAnd if they slip awayYou gotta somehow sayYou're still on my mindSo your memory's all I have left nowThese words are all I can giveAnd from time to time I turn back in my mindTo the place where you'll always livePlayin' pirates in the school-yard, singin'Soldiers in the fieldsWe were dreamin'Brothers in blood 'til the very end
