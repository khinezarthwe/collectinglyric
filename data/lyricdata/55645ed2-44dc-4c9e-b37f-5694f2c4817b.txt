Your subtleties they strangle meI can't explain myself at allAnd all the wants, and all the needsAll I don't want to need at allThe walls start breathing, my mind's unweavingMaybe it's best you leave me aloneA weight is lifted on this eveningI give the final blowWhen darkness turns to lightIt ends tonight, it ends tonightA falling star, at least I fall aloneI can't explain what you can't explainYou're finding things that you didn't knowI look at you with such disdainThe walls start breathing, my mind's unweavingMaybe it's best you leave me aloneA weight is lifted on this eveningI give the final blowWhen darkness turns to lightIt ends tonight, it ends tonightJust a little insight won't make this rightIt's too late to fight, it ends tonight, it ends tonightNow I'm on my own sideIt's better than being on your sideIt's my fault when you're blindIt's better that I see it through your eyesAll these thoughts locked insideNow you're the first to knowWhen darkness turns to lightIt ends tonight, it ends tonightJust a little insight won't make this rightIt's too late to fight, it ends tonightIt ends when darkness turns to lightIt ends tonight, it ends tonightJust a little insight won't make this rightIt's too late to fight, it ends tonight, it ends tonightTonight, insightWhen darkness turns to light it ends tonight
