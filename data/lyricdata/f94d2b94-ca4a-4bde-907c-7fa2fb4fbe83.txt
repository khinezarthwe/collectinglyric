I see you and you see me (I see you, I see you)There's only one thing this could be,I think you know just what I meanWhen I'm with you I feel so freeAnd I love you and I hope you love me tooAnd I need you and I hope you need me tooBabe, I just hope that you know to never let me go'Cause when it comes to forever we should be togetherWhen we meet up the whole world stopsThe musics louder, temperature dropsIt seems like they're all dancing to our beatLook around I know you'll seeAnd I love you and I hope you love me tooAnd I need you and I hope you need me tooBabe, I just hope that you know to never let me go'Cause when it comes to forever we should be togetherAnd I love you and I hope you love me tooAnd I need you and I hope you need me tooBabe, I just hope that you know to never let me go'Cause when it comes to forever we should be togetherBabe, I just hope that you know to never let me go'Cause when it comes to forever we should be together
