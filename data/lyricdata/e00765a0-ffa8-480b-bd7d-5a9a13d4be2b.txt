She's a special girl, you know,The kind I'd hope to see,Hanging on a wall,Watching me cross the streetI wonder how long it will be,Before I'm sick of her,And I no longer careWhere she goes or has been,'Cause she's the new thing'Cause she's the new thingShe is the new thing'Cause she's the new thingShe is the new thing,She is the new thing,Another new thing,Feel my stomach sink,As I cast myself inShe is the new thingAlways the new thingStaring at her,Alterior girlOnce she had me on my knees,Enamoured with diseaseNow, she fails to impressA different sicknessA different kind of sickness,Lacking any interestAnd I, sunk in apathy,Totally absorbed in meSitting vacant on my own,My senses lying proneShe was the new thing (x3)Another new thing (x3)She was the new thingAnother new thingFeel my stomach sinkAs I curse my slow limbsShe was the new thingAnother new thing,Staring at her,Alterior girl,I cast myself into whatever she brings...Another newWith sickness,It ends how it begins:First mine then hers,And then the cycle blursAs my actions reoccurThrough no fault of my own (x4)I am a new thing (x4)
