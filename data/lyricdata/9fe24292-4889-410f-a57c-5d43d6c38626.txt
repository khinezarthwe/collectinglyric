I can tell you what they say in spaceThat our earth is too greyBut when the spirit is so digitalThe body acts this wayThat world was killing meThat world was killing meDisassociativeThe nervous system's downThe nervous system's down I know (x2)CHORUSI can never get out of hereI don't want to just float in fearA dead astronaut in space (x2)Sometimes we walk like we were shotThrough our heads, my loveWe write our song in spaceLike we are already dead and goneYour world was killing meYour world was killing meDisassociativeYour world was killing meYour world was killing meDisassociativeCHORUSThe nervous system's down (x4)CHORUS
