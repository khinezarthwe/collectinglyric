We haveThe chance to turn the pages overWe can write what we want to writeWe gotta make ends meet, before we get much olderWe're all someone's daughterWe're all someone's sonHow long can we look at each otherDown the barrel of a gun?[Chorus]You're the voice, try and understand itMake a noise and make it clearWe're not gonna sit in silenceWe're not gonna live with fearThis timeWe know we all can stand togetherWith the power to be powerfulBelieving, we can make it betterWe're all someone's daughterWe're all someone's sonHow long can we look at each otherDown the barrel of a gun?[Chorus]We're all someone's daughterWe're all someone's sonHow long can we look at each otherDown the barrel of a gun?[Chorus: x2]You're the voice, try and understand itMake a noise and make it clear
