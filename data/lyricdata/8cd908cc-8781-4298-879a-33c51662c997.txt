I stepped out off the train at dawnWalked along an open roadTo find youYou made beds at the gold motelSold junk at the carouselTo bind youLolitaYou make my wheel, set me free,Won't you come home with me?We used to meet at the waterfallPink heather on the falling wallNothing to proveDrank beer from a stolen canSmoke cigarettes when we canBecause we like toLolitaYou make my wheel, set me free,Won't you come home with me?Memories tangled up the spokes thatMake my wheel,Make my wheel,Oh everything has gone wrong!I left you at the gold motelSelling junk at the carouselThat bound you downCan't find you nowLolitaYou make my wheel, set me free,Won't you come home with me?
