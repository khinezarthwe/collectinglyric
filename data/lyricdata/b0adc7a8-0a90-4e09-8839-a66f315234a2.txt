He left no time to regretKept his dick wetWith his same old safe betMe and my head highAnd my tears dryGet on without my guyYou went back to what you knewSo far removedFrom all that we went throughAnd I tread a troubled trackMy odds are stackedI go back to blackWe only said goodbye with wordsI died a hundred timesYou go back to herAnd I go back to...I go back to usI love you muchIt's not enoughYou love blow and I love puffAnd life is like a pipeAnd I'm a tiny pennyRolling up the walls insideWe only said goodbye with wordsI died a hundred timesYou go back to herAnd I go back to...We only said goodbye with wordsI died a hundred timesYou go back to herAnd I go back to...Black, black, black, blackBlack, black, blackI go back toI go back to...We only said goodbye with wordsI died a hundred timesYou go back to herAnd I go back to...We only said goodbye with wordsI died a hundred timesYou go back to herAnd I go back to black
