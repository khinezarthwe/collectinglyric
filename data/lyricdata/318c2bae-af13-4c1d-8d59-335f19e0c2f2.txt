Never straight and narrowI won't keep in timeTend to burn the arrowOut of lineBeen inclined to wanderOff the beaten trackThat's where there's thunderAnd the wind shouts backGrinderLooking for meatGrinderWants you to eatGot no use for routineI shiver at the thoughtOpen skies are my sceneThat's why I won't get caughtRefuse to bite the mantrapBe led to set the snareI love to have my sightCapped everywhereGrinderLooking for meatGrinderWants you to eatI have my licence, it came with birthFor self reliance on this earthYou take the bullet on which my nameWas etched upon in your gameDay of independenceStamped us like a brand'Round the necks of millionsTo the landAs the mighty eagleI need room to breatheWitness from the treadmillI take my leaveGrinderLooking for meatGrinderWants you to eatGrinderLooking for meatGrinderWants you to eatGrinder
