I sense the night bending towards meThe rhythm is slowed but deepBlackened tips of desireCannot keep out of my reachOrchid covered deadwood breezeWakes the sickness from the leavesI laid back and counted starsDidn't stop my violent seedIntoxication pollenBegins to swim around meThe bitter taste of temptationEvokes a slow sweet ecstasyThe guilt of self-destructionBeads up and rolls off of meAnd sinks into the earth andTakes with it my purityFrom breaking freeSwallowed down resistance growing from the innate drive to riseRise like a street steam night spy mixing with the skyUltravioletGhost whispers burning my earsI'm wrapped in words like wireAppearing to disappearLike a small dying fireMy hands shake the sting escapesHeated hearts must expireAnd slowly regenerateThe lust for this peace won't tireI'm breaking freeDescending from thunderFixed in your eyes in mineNow Let go eternal wantingAnd I run into your mind
