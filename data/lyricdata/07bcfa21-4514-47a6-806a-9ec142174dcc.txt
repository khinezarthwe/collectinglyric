They tell me that you're doing fineBut I wish I had the timeTo get through to youBut all I can do is give you some spaceTo chase someone elseTo be the sun sitting in your little skyToo much to doAnd there's not enough time, not enough timeWalking past your place the other dayI wish that I could stayFor a little whileOh no 'cos there's places to goAnd people to seeTime runs away so easilyIt never waits for meToo much to doAnd there's not enough time, not enough timeI told her all of this too lateShe looked me up and downAnd turned to walk awayIn time we'll know that it's best we both goBefore the night becomes the dayAnd there's nothing more to say
