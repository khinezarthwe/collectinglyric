I've been searching for youI heard a cry within my soulI've never had a yearning quite like this beforeNow here you are walking right through my doorAll of my lifeWhere have you beenI wonder if I'll ever see you againAnd if that day comesI know we could winI wonder if I'll ever see you againA sacred gift of heavenFor better, worse, whereverAnd I would never let somebody break you downOr take your crown, neverAll of my lifeWhere have you beenI wonder if I'll ever see you againAnd if that day comesI know we could winI wonder if I'll ever see you againI've searched through timeI've always knownThat you were there upon your throneA lonely queen without her kingI've longed for you my love foreverAll of my lifeWhere have you beenI wonder if I'll ever see you againAnd if that day comesI know we could winI wonder if I'll ever see you againAll of my lifeWhere have you beenI wonder if I'll ever see you againAnd if that day comesI know we could winI wonder if I'll ever see you againAll of my lifeWhere have you beenI wonder if I'll ever see you againAnd if that day comesI know we could winI wonder if I'll ever see you againI wonder if I'll ever see you againI wonder if I'll ever see you againI wonder if I'll ever see you againI wonder if I'll ever see you againI wonder if I'll ever see you againI wonder if I'll ever see you againI wonder if I'll ever see you again...
