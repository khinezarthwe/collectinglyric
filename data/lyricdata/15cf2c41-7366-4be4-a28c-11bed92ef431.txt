I'm dreaming about tomorrowI'm thinkingOf yesterdayI consume myselfIn sorrowThis moment in timeIs what I betrayBut I am searching for the answersAnd I look aroundSometimes I get sad'Cause I don't know which way to goAnd I look aroundSometimes I get sad'Cause my life is spinning out of controlI never knowWhat you wantI never knowWhat you needIt was differenceFrom the startWhen you cut me in twoI never thought I would bleedBut I am searching for the answersAnd I look aroundSometimes I get sad'Cause I don't know which way to goAnd I look aroundSometimes I get sad'Cause my life is spinning out of controlI will call this aloneI don't need nobody's helpI've got to do this myselfAlone, alone, alone, aloneAnd I look aroundSometimes I get sad'Cause I don't know which way to goAnd I look aroundSometimes I get sad'Cause my life is spinning out of control [x2]
