Forced to deal with decisions you never thought come trueAbandoned by the ones you've trusted, no one's there for youInternal maelstrom of confusion, unsure of who you areThe things you used in definition didn't take you very farChorus:The things I felt before I'm not sure if they're thereWords which meant so much fall on ears which just don't careEmotions all entangled, it's time to reearrangeThe seasons pass, emotions die, I'm helpless as things changeWe often times define ourselves by our titles and our friendsWe place our trust in fallacies which eventually will endBut just like dreams that fade away with every morning's lightWe're left with only memories, no tangibles in sightRepeat chorusSolo: LykinsNow I find I'm all alone and wondering what is realInsecure of who I am, afraid of what I feelBut I'm on the path to knowledge, the darkness won't last longerThat which does not kill me, only makes me strongerRepeat chorusThings changeThings changeThings changeThings change
