I don't feel betterWhen I'm fucking aroundAnd I don't write betterWhen I'm stuck in the groundSo don't teach me lesson'Cause I've already learnedYeah the sun will be shiningAnd my children will burnOh, the heart beats in its cageI don't want what you wantI don't feel what you feelSee, I'm stuck in a cityBut I belong in a fieldYeah we got left, left, leftLeft, left, leftNow it's three in the morningAnd you're eating aloneOh, the heart beats in its cageAll our friends, they're laughing at usAll of those you loved you mistrustHelp me I'm just not quite myselfLook around there's no one else thereI went to the concertAnd I fought through the crowdGuess I got too excitedWhen I thought you were aroundOh, he gets left, left, leftLeft, left, leftAnd I'm sorry you were thinkingI would steal your fireOh, the heart beats in its cageYes, the heart beats in its cage
