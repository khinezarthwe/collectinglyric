I can't find the rhyme in all my reasonLost sense of time and all seasonsFeel I've been beaten downBy the words of men who have no groundsCan't sleep beneath the trees of wisdomWhen your ax has cut the roots that feed themForked tongues in bitter mouthsCan drive a man to bleed from inside outWhat if you did?What if you lied?What if I avenge?What if eye for an eye?I've seen the wicked fruit of your vineDestroy the man who lacks a strong mindHuman pride sings a vengeful songInspired by the times you've been walked onMy stage is shared by many millionsWho lift their hands up high because they feel thisWe are one, we are strongThe more you hold us down, the more we press onWhat if you did?What if you lied?What if I avenge?What if eye for an eye?I know I can't hold my hate inside my mind'Cause what consumes your thoughts controls your lifeSo I'll just ask a question, a lonely, simple questionI'll just ask one questionWhat if, what if, what if, what if, what if I?What if, what if, what if, what if, what if I?What if, what if, what if, what if, what if I?What if, what if, what if, what if, what if I?What if you did?What if you lied?What if I avenge?What if eye for an eye?What if your wordsCould be judged like a crime?What if, what if, what if, what if, what if I?What if, what if, what if, what if, what if I?What if, what if, what if, what if, what if I?What if, what if, what if, what if, what if I?
