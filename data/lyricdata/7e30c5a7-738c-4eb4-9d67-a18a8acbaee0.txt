Cold seems cripplingLame, meander through corridorsAromas thick with ageMark off the dayReflections of my life are fadingPull me out this bodyDon't want it... Don't want inFeeble frail and rotting, descendingI'm lost in structure that's collapsingDon't want it... Cast intoMaker, take the body,Don't want it... It wants me!Past has found its placeSalvation is no moreWill God accept my peace?Bleached, will pardon meReflections of my life are fadingPull me out this bodyDon't want it... Don't want inFeeble frail and rotting, descendingI'm lost in structure that's collapsingDon't want it... Cast intoMaker, take the body,Don't want it... It wants me!I just want to run around,Fly kites, wrestle, jump and playSwim through waves that crash to shoreMemories in me... Cocooned in miseryI'm sick, and tired,Of embracing reflections of past time!Receive me or cast me away!God, please take me away!Resistance futile!  Suicidal ideas...I will crucify my own being,Satisfy selfish needs, fuck the deitiesJustify my own right to what's waiting for me!On the other side...The time has come... Lock and load...I'm coming... I'm coming...I'm coming... I'm coming home!Pull me out the body,Don't want it... Don't want in...Pull me out my body,Don't want it... Don't want in...Pull me out this body,Don't want it... Don't want in...Feeble, frail and rotting... DescendingI'm lost in structure that's collapsingDescending... Don't want it...Maker, take the bodyDon't want it... Don't want inPull me out this body,Don't want it... Don't want in...Feeble, frail and rotting... DescendingI'm lost in structure that's collapsingDescending... Don't want it...Maker, take the bodyDon't want it... It wants me!I just want to run around,Fly kites, wrestle, jump and playSwim through waves that crash to shoreMemories in me... Cocooned in miseryThe darkness overcomes,Soul soars to the other planeExistence past the door,I sail through Purgatory's bayI asked a god for poison... Cradle me!Sown my dreams... Soul searchingDeath blossoms where clouds lie over me!Held in God's hands... Death bloom[ing]"Dark, for fear of failure...An inner gloom as wide as an eye and fermenting...Broiling hate... Death-grip in my veins...Unveiling rancid petals, flowering forth foul nectar...Space between a blink and a tear... Death blooms."
