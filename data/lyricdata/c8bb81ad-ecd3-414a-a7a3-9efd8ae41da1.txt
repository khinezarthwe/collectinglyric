Understand once he was a family manSo surely I would never, ever go through it first handEmulate all the shit my mother hatedI can't help but demostrate my Freudian fateMy alibi for taking your guyHistory repeats itself, it fails to dieAnd animal agression is my downfallI don't care 'bout what you got I wanted allIt's bricked up in my head, it's shoved under my bedAnd I question myself again: what is it 'bout men?My destructive side has grown a mile wideAnd I question myself again: what is it 'bout men?I'm nurturing, I just wanna do my thingAnd I'll take the wrong man as naturally as I singAnd I'll save my tears for uncovering my fearsFor behavioural patters that stick over the yearsIt's bricked up in my head, it's shoved under my bedAnd I question myself again: what is it 'bout men?My destructive side has grown a mile wideAnd I question myself again: what is it 'bout men?
