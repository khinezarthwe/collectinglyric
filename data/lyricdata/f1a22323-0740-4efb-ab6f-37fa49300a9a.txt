Trapped in purgatoryA lifeless object, aliveAwaiting reprisalDeath will be their acquittanceThe sky is turning redReturn to power draws nearFall into me, the sky's crimson tearsAbolish the rules made of stonePierced from below, souls of my treacherous pastBetrayed by many, now ornaments dripping aboveAwaiting the hour of reprisalYour time slips awayRaining bloodFrom a lacerated skyBleeding its horrorCreating my structureNow I shall reign in blood!
