Again, the burden of losing rests upon my shouldersAnd its weight seems unbearable"Your tomb is where your heart is," I should have told herBut within me hid a secret so terribleTo cry is to know that you're aliveBut my river of tears has run dryI never wanted to fool you, noBut a cold heart is a dead heartAnd it feels like I've been buried alive by loveIf I should die before I wakePray no one my soul to takeAnd if I wake before I dieRescue me with your smileThe kiss of vanity blessed me with a spiritual murderFed the gods of war, insatiable"Your home is where the dark is," I should have told herEmbraced the fire, indestructibleTo die is to know that you're aliveAnd my river of blood won't run dryI never wanted to lose you, noBut a cold heart is a dead heartAnd it feels like I've been buried alive by loveIf I should die before I wakePray no one my soul to takeAnd if I wake before I dieRescue me with your smileOh, they say to cry is to know that you're aliveBut my river of tears has run dryI never wanted to fool you, noBut a cold heart is a dead heartAnd a deserted soul is goneA cold heart is a dead heartAnd it feels like I've been buried alive by love
