And my words will be here when I'm goneAs I'm fading away against the windAnd the words you left me linger onAs I'm failing again now, never to change thisAnd I'm sympatheticNever letting on I feel the way I doAs I'm falling apart again at the seamAnd it seems I'm alone here, hollow againAs I'm flailing again against the windAnd the scars I am left with swallow againAs I'm failing again now, never to change thisAnd I'm sympatheticNever letting on I feel the way I doAs I'm falling apart again at the seamAnd I'm sympatheticNever letting on I feel the way I doAs I'm falling apart again at the seamThe same old feelings are taking overAnd I can't seem to make 'em go awayAnd I can't take all the pressure soberBut I can't seem to make it go awayThe same old feelings are taking overAnd I can't seem to make them go awayAnd I can't take all the pressure sober(I can't make it go away. I can't make it go away)And I'm sympatheticNever letting on I feel the way I doAs I'm falling apart again at the seamAnd I'm sympatheticNever letting on I feel the way I doAs I'm falling apart again at the seamAnd I'm falling, falling, fallingFalling, falling, falling, fallingApart again at the seam
