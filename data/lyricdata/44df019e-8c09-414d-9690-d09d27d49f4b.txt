When you were young and on your ownHow did it feel to be aloneI was always thinking of games that I was playingTrying to make the best of my timeBut only love can break your heartTry to be sure right from the startYes, only love can break your heartBut if your world should fall apartI have a friend I've never seenHe hides his head inside a dreamSomeone should call him and see if he can come outTry to lose the down that he's foundBut only love can break your heartTry to be sure right from the startYes, only love can break your heartBut if your world should fall apartI was always thinking...
