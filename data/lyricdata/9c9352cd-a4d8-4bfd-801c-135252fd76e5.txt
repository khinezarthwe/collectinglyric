Common as the cold -Up for sale, never sold.Getting older & it shows;Your disappointment only grows.& no one seems to carethat you never got your share -Who said life was fair?So smile - it's not so bad.You lost your health -Never had no wealth;So tighten up your beltAs you gather dust upon some shelf.You lost by just a noseBut there's no prize for place or show.Now, at least, you know.So smile - it's not so bad.Tired out & broken down,You've played the field & made the rounds.Now you're stuck in this one-horse town -Your only solace is the sound of melody & verse.Though your bag's about to burst;Others have it worse.So smile - it's not so bad.
