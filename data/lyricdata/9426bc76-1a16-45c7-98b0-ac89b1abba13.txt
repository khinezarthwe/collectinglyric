At the starting of the weekAt summit talks you'll hear them speakIt's only MondayNegotiations breaking downSee those leaders start to frownIt's sword and gun dayTomorrow never comes until it's too lateYou could be sitting taking lunchThe news will hit you like a punchIt's only TuesdayYou never thought we'd go to warAfter all the things we sawIt's April Fools' dayTomorrow never comes until it's too lateTomorrow never comes until it's too lateYou hear a whistling overheadAre you alive or are you dead?It's only ThursdayYou feel a shaking on the groundA billion candles burn aroundIs it your birthday?Tomorrow never comes until it's too lateTomorrow never comes until it's too lateMake tomorrow come I think it's too late
