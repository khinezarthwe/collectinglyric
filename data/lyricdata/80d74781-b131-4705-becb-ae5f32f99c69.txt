Laid my cards on the tableSo she could see the lightMy efforts went wastedDue to fallen night...And I knowBut by the end of the eveningI was in no doubtOf all of the thingsThat you could live withoutAnd i know...I drag up ancient historyHope that they'll forgive meThey had nothing but ego'sBut they would multiplyAll the reasons that i would tryThat i know...To be making it harder to be seen but oh,Is it too much to ask for to be left alone?Yeah i knowI drag up ancient historyHope that they'll forgive meLaid my cards on the tableso she could see the lightmy efforts went wasteddue to fallen nightand i know...I drag up ancient historyHope that they'll forgive meMargaret HammondHemorrhaged in "The Merrie City"Margaret HammondDied in "The Merrie City"
