This is why events unnerve meThey find it all a different storyNo concern, for wheels are turningTurn again and turn towards this timeAll she asks the strength to hold meThen again the same old storyWord will travel oh so quicklyTravel first and lean towards this timeOh, I'll break them down, no mercy shownHeaven knows, it's got to be this timeWatching her, these things she saidThe times she cried, too frail to wake this timeOh, I'll break them down, no mercy shownHeaven knows, it's got to be this timeAvenues all lined with treesPicture me and then you start watchingWatching foreverForever, watching love growForever, letting me goForever
