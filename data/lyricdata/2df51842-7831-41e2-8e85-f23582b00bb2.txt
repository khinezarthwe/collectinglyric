When you break up the boys from the menIt feels just like me and themAnd for the love of a hardened heartDo something with your handsWhen you pick up a book with no endIt feels just like me againAnd for the love of your open armsDo something with your handsI've got a sicknessI think I need your help tonightStones in your bloodstreamI think I'm getting out tonightI've got a sicknessI think I need your help tonightStones in your bloodstreamI think I'm getting out tonight, out tonightWhen I said you could live on my backI don't remember saying thatAnd for the love of an aged friendDo something for yourselfYou eventually fall off the endIt feels just like me againAnd for the price of a human heartIt's really not that badI've got a sicknessI think I need your help tonightIron in your bloodstreamI think I'm getting out tonightI've got a sicknessI think I need your help tonightIron in your bloodstreamI think I'm getting out tonight, out tonight
