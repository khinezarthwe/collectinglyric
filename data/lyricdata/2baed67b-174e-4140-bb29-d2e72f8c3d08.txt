The walls around come down and they're crashing around meAnd there's a taste in my mouth that feels like the bitter endAnd if I get away from the pain and the voices that hound meWell I'm not quite sure I've got the strength to start over againBut if I make it to the setting sunWell I might have a story to tell before the day I'm goneIf I fall to sorrow, and find it hard to see to the endDo I have the heart to go, and try it again?
