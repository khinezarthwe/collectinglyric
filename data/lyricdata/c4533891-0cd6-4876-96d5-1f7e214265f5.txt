Slip away out the back doorGet away from the scenery scoreIn the car you're ready to moveIn the backseat you start to grooveRight turn left turn got the boys in both handsPlayin in stereo like you do with most bandsUnlocking the doorI can tell you can't waitSeekin power rockinGirl you love to vibrateCan't get to sleep 'cause I hear you squealinLike a stuck little pig you love the feelinI wish you'd shut up 'cause I'm tryin to sleepI'm gonna gag you gonna push it down deepRunning out of breathYou're chokin fastYou begin to sputterYou're not gonna lastJackhammer pounding your pileJackhammer you're gonna creamJackhammer that's your styleJackhammer you're gonna screamThere you go again with your dirty little mindTrying to turn me on won't happen this timeHangin around and that won't doNothing on my mind but gettin rid of youTime for you to leaveCan't take no moreJust wanna see youWalking out the door
