Does it make you happy to ignore me on streets?I guess by now you think I'm weakI wish you would have said something before nowI wouldn't share a bag of chips with youAnd in my opinion you don't have a clueI'm being cruel, I'm being cruelI don't want to be part of your sceneI'll stay with him, I'll keep my nose cleanYou're the one pretending to be licking stampsAll alone in a room following lines on mapsIt's clear you don't want me hereHow about I send you a book on nutrition?Stop spoon-feeding me non-fictionJust for a while, I will fake a smileI don't want to be part of your sceneI'll stay with him, I'll keep my nose cleanOh, why did you say she was a friend of mine?I thought it was me you couldn't standI'm confused, I will win, you will loseYou've taken to phoning my house when you're drunkAnd then confessing all your loveI wish you would have said so before nowI don't want to be part of your sceneI'll stick with him, I'll keep my nose clean
