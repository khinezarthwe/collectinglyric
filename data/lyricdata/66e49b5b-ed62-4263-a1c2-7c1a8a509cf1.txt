Every time I close my eyes, I see it.The way you occupy my mind. I need itGot addicted to that smile, I feel it.You got to know what's on my mind, read it.I feel so high, high on lifeI see heaven in your eyesHigh on lifeDon't you waste your timeWherever you go, I'll be there.You know you can't hide from meI was the one you neededTo feel so high on life, so free.I feel so high, high on lifeI see heaven in your eyes,I feel so highRead it in my eyes.Every promise that we make, keep itall the love I really need, you give it.I feel so high, high on life.High on lifeI feel so high, high on lifeI see heaven in your eyesI feel so high on lifeDon't you waste your time.
