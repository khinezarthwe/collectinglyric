Where two oceans meetI will find you there‘neath the wind worn heathUnder cliff tops bareAnd I will find you thereAnd I will cover theeAnd you will cling to meWhere two oceans meetAnd when our days are fewI will cling to youAnd you will sing for meWhen our days are fewAnd when our candle’s burnedWe will both return‘neath the wind worn heathWhere two oceans meet
