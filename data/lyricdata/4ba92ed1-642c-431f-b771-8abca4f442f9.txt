Here's another sunday morning callYer hear yer head-a-banging on the doorSlip your shoes on and then out you crawlInto a day that couldn't give you moreBut what for?And in your head do you feelWhat you're not supposed to feelAnd you take what you wantBut you don't get it for freeYou need more timeCos your thoughts and words won't last forever moreAnd I'm not sureIf it'll ever work out rightBut it's OKIt's all rightWhen you're lonely and you start to hearThe little voices in your head at nightYou will only sniff away the tearsSo you can dance until the morning lightAt what priceAnd in your head do you feelWhat you're not supposed to feelAnd you take what you wantBut you won't get it for freeYou need more timeBecause your thoughts and words won't last forever moreAnd I'm not sureIf it'll ever work out rightIt's OKIt's all rightAnd in your head do you feelWhat you're not supposed to feelAnd you take what you wantBut you won't get hope for freeYou need more timeBecause your thoughts and words won't last forever moreAnd I'm not sureIf it'll ever, ever, ever work out rightIf it'll ever, ever, ever work out rightWill it ever, ever, ever work out right
