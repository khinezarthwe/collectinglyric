Here's another speech you wish I'd swallowAnother cue for you to fold your earsAnother train of thought too hard to followChugging along to the song that belongs to the shifting of gearsPlease forgive me for my distanceThe pain is evident in my existencePlease forgive for my distanceThe shame is manifest in my resistanceTo your love, to your love, to your loveI would've warned you, but really, what's the point?Caution could but rarely ever helpsDon't be down, my demeanor tends to disappointIt's hard enough even trying to be civil to myselfPlease forgive me for my distanceThe pain is evident in my existencePlease forgive for my distanceThe shame is manifest in my resistanceTo your love, to your love, to your loveMy derring-do allows me to dance the rigadoonAround youBut by the time I'm close to youI lose my desideratum and now you, soNow you have it, so tell me baby what's the word?Am I your gal, or should I get out of town?I just need to be reassuredDo you just deal it out, or can you deal withWhat I lay down?Please forgive me for my distanceThe pain is evident in my existencePlease forgive me for my distanceThe shame is manifest in my resistanceTo your love, to your love, to your love
