So it's safe to say that we've been here before;Heart torn out, down for the count and still come back for more.This lesson is learned too well.Though, only unlearned by the time your wounds have healed.Have you had enough?I guess not because your lips are stuck to his.It's Time to say enough is enough, you would be so better off.You love him but tough because it's not coming back from him.You can't win.Stop expecting change, he's just a lost cause that you're waiting on.Take a look around, you could have anyone.So leave undeserving him.It only hurts at first.But then you will find someone to give you everything you want.Try not to go running back to him.So it goes unsaid that we've been here before.Lonely nights and endless fights and sleeping on the floor.And he's sorry, so the story goes.It's read and replayed and ends the same wayStop expecting change, he's just a lost cause that you're waiting on.Take a look around, you could have anyone.So leave undeserving him.Stop expecting change, he's just a lost cause that you're waiting on.Take a look around, you could have anyone.So leave undeserving him.
