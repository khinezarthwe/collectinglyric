When you're talkin' to yourselfAnd nobody's homeYou can fool yourselfYou came in this world alone(Alone)So nobody ever told you babyHow it was gonna beSo what'll happen to you babyGuess we'll have to wait and seeONE, TWOOld at heart but I'm only 28And I'm much too youngTo let love break my heartYoung at heart but it's getting much too lateTo find ourselves so far apartI don't know how you're s'posedTo find me latelyAn what more could you ask from meHow could you say that I never needed youWhen you took everythingSaid you took everything from meYoung at heart and it gets so hard to waitWhen no one I know can seem to help me nowOld at heart but I mustn't hesitateIf I'm to find my own way outStill talkin' to myselfAnd nobody's home(Alone)So nobody ever told us babyHow it was gonna beSo what'll happen to us babyGuess we'll have to wait and seeWhen I find out all the reasonsMaybe I'll find another wayFind another dayWith all the changing seasons of my lifeMaybe I'll get it right next timeAnd now that you've been broken downGot your head out of the cloudsYou're back down on the groundAnd you don't talk so loudAnd you don't walk so proudAny more, and what forWell I jumped into the riverToo many times to make it homeI'm out here on my own, and drifting all aloneIf it doesn't show give it timeTo read between the lines'Cause I see the storm is getting closerAnd the waves, they get so highSeems everything we've ever known's hereWhy must it drift away and dieI'll never find anyone to replace youGuess I'll have to make it through, this timeOh this timeWithout youI knew the storm was getting closerAnd all my friends said I was highBut everything we've ever known's hereI never wanted it to die
