Can't remember my name,Can't remember at allFinding you from past times,I think...How did we ever fall?Never knowing the answers,Calling myself namesNow is not the question for usWill it ever be againWhy don't you just fly,fly to me?How long will you wait for me?Never?Now or never againFeel me up inside you,How you quiver and shakeCan rake you back to my life?Will you trust me again?Now or never...I'll never let you down,So fly to me!How long Can I wait...Why don't you just fly,Fly to me?How long will you wait for me?Never?NOW OR NEVER AGAIN!
