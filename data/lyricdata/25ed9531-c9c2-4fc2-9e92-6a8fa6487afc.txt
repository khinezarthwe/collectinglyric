I looked up, picked out a map in the skyNo need for the nude of the moon as I'm guided by firefliesYou whisper prayers to my feetI tiptoe through gardens, minding the slumber of parakeetsA lover's on the wayI won't feel the pull of the coming dayOr the compromise of sleepCause i got a fire on the soles of my feetI'm going as far as these crooked legs take meNot stoping for water at dew covered daisiesNot waiting for rivers or meadows to bleh meNot washing the blood that has covered and stained meOh, oh, to beFooled by the wool that has covered meOh, oh, to beLead by the light of the melodyI'm making my way while the sun can not save meI'm watching the road with 2 young eyes to guide meNot looking behind to ensure that the home fires are shrinkingThe fireflies fade as the city lights find meOh, oh, to beFooled by the wool that had covered meOh, oh, to beLead by the light of a melodyI'm going as far as these crooked legs take meI'm watching the road with 2 young eyes to guide meI'm making my way while the sun can not save meI'm going as far as these crooked legs take me
