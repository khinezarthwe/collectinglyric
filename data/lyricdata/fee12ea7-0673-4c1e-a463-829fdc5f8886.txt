The night is starting here we goI check out everythingThis is our time to lose controlWhat do you want from meYou line them up we'll put them downThis is so frustratingTo watch you sleezing all aroundYet you keep on smilingWhat can I do to make you see?(You're guilty)What can I do to make you feel?(You're wanted)What can I do to make you see?(You're guilty)I'm suffocating under words of sorrowHer skin reflects behind the blurI'm intoxicatedWhere am I from? Why am I here?(You're so predictable)Fingers running through my hair,But its all just fictionShe steps out from her underwear,So beautifulWhat can I do to make you see?(You're guilty)What can I do to make you feel?(You're wanted)What can I do to make you see…(You're guilty)I'm suffocating under words of sorrowGo!(there's bodies lying on the floor)But I keep on staring…(my world is over, close the door)Her skin reflects behind the blurI'm intoxicatedWhere am I from? Why am I here?You're so predictableFingers running through my hairI'm a new addictionShe steps out from her underwearSo beautifulWhat can I do to make you see?(You're guilty)What can I do to make you feel?(You're wanted)What can I do to make you see?(You're guilty)I'm suffocating under words of sorrow(Words of sorrow)
