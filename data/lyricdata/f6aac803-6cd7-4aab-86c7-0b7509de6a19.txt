I don't wanna go to workI just wanna lie here in bed all dayWorking for minimum wage ain't to good of payNowhere I'd rather beOuu in the sea, that's where I belongMaybe with my bandJammin' on this reggae songBut it's time to go to work nowMaybe I'll come insteadMaybe Heaven will fall to earthBetter make it quickI go on through my daysOuu Like a Man in a drunken hazeLife will find a way no matter what they sayI tossed and turned all nightOuu and sat in my bedI try to make it ritebut I forget about it insteadThe boss says come in hereBut I pretend that I'm asleepMy life is falling fallingI'm in trouble deepMaybe I'll talk to godBut will he talk to meAnd I'm trying to be strong nowBut I'm so damn weak
