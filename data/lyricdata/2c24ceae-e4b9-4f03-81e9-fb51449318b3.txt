No one knows just what has become of her: Shattered, dull, desperateOh, so innocent and delicate, but too damn obdurate and obstinate to let goBroken down, hurt again; it never endsFrightened and tremblingDid she fall again? An accident?Her eyes encircled in black againI can't believe that she's still with himFor how long will you try?How long until you walk away?Your façade can't disguise the fact that you're in miseryLook inside see what has become of her, hiding within againCan she pick herself up again?It's just too difficult and arduous to let goHomicide flashes through her mind againNo more pain, take controlIf he raises his hand again, she'll find the freedom in killing himThe world will see that she's had enoughFor how long will you try?How long until you walk away?Your façade can't disguise the fact that you're in miseryFor how long will you try?How long until you walk away?From the look in your eyes, I know you bleed internallyFor how long you deny?How long until you walk away?Your façade can't disguise the fact that you're in miseryFor how long will you try?How long until you walk away?From the look in your eyes, I know you bleed internallyBroken down, hurt again; it never ends
