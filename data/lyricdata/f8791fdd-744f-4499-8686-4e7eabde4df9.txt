The days they go slow.The nights they go fast.It's only some time,Til we get together.I'm out on the street.I'm waiting for you.Do you hear me looking?The method is clearIn waiting for you.I think I need a distraction.I'm not staying in.I'm searching for you.I can never find you.Go downtown put the drugs in my body.Step back up I'm the life of the party.Come back home and we'll get something started.Stay up late put some heat in my heartache.
