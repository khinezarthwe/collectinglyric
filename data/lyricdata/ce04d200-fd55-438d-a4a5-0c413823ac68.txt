From dark waters I riseMy once trembling shell conceals a GodPower surging through the void I soarIntoxicating visions whispering moreIn my radiance every colorSeems to fadeI've learned to cry and crawl awayBut at the closing of our circle you will payI see the hope vanish in your eyesI feel the ecstasy in me ariseI speak only in thoughtLife is not forever nothing is foreverIn dark waters I findBeauty beyond oceans of timePower surging through the void I soarIntoxicating visions whispering moreIn my radiance every colorWill soon fade awayIn the emptiness I will no longer stayI've learned to cry and crawl awayBut at the closings of our circle you will payI see the hope vanish in your eyesI feel the ecstasy in me arise
