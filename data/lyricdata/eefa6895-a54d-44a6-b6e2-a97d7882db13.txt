Dip a cloth in a bowl of blood; clean your horse's hide with it.Stick a fish in a tattoo gun; watch what color ink comes out.Die, gin bottle wedged in wet hand.Best at what I do, mom says.Shake your halo down like snow from a pregnant cloud about to blow.Makes a neckbrace, a belt, and then a hole in the ground.
