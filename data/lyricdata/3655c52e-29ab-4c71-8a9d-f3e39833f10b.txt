Be aware, half is promisedBelieve, what I sayBefore, I go foreverBe sure, of what you saySo do you paint a pretty picture?And he tells you that he needs youAnd he covers you with flowersAnd he always keeps you dreamingIf he always keeps you dreamingYou won't have a lonely hourIf a day could last foreverYou might like your ivory towerBut the night begins to turn your head aroundBe aware, half is promisedBelieve, what I sayBefore, I go foreverBe sure, of what you sayFor the words may come to easyIf you don't believe I'm leavingAnd goodbye may come too quicklyIf you really think he loves youIf you really think he loves youYou would give your love so sweetlyAnd the day would last foreverYou would fall in love completelyBut the night begins to turn your head aroundYes the night begins to turn your head aroundBut the night begins to turn your head aroundAnd you know you're gonna lose more than you foundYes the night begins to turn your head around
