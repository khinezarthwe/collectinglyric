One day gone, life's not the same without you.We can all be strong.But strength can't bring back the one's we've lost.Holding on, moments will last always inside of our heartsBut what good are hearts when their Beatz have stopped?My friend it hurts that you're gone.You should still be here.The world knows it wasn't your time.Taken away and screaming, "Don't go, don't."We know you're needed here with us.It's so hard moving on.We wake up everyday without a friend,knowing it wasn't his time.Passing onWe know that you're looking out for us all.Still, so hard to believe that you're not with us.You can't bring back the ones you've lost.You can't bring back the ones you've lost.You belong down here smiling wide.Don't go.No, don't go.You belong down here smiling wide.You know you're needed here with us.
