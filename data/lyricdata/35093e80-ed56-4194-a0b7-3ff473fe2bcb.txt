Are you saying loveOr are you saying nothingStill life is a crime that I can't ignoreYour perfect ways will follow the temperature that's risingAll this time you never me thinkIt was the hardest part to knowIt was the fastest we could runIt was the furthest we could goWe are a lie, my angelCause for hateAnd a cause for endingIt sounds so easyBut everytime we were supposed to let goWe'd make love"Now pull me closer let the heat take over"Call me your wayCall me awayDon't end it openI tried to love you like beforeIf this was our nightIt was the best one of our livesAre you saying nowOr are you saying neverThe still frame in my mind cannot be ignoredAnd all I can rememberIs the way you moved your bodyAnd how your lips never said "no"But it was killing you insideCause you thought I was the oneAnd now it's out of your controlYou have arrived my angelCause for hateAnd a cause for endingIt sounds so easyBut everytime we were supposed to let goWe'd make love"Now pull me closer let the heat take over"Youwe were drawling lines not to crossSo we would never feel a thingAnd now it's breaking you apartJust like it broke your heartCause for hateAnd a cause for endingIt sounds so easyBut everytime we were supposed to let goWe'd make love"Now pull me closer let the heat take over"Call me your wayCall me awayDon't end it openI tried to love you like beforeIf this was our nightIt was the best one of our lives
