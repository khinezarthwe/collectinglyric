Take my handI've changed my mind againReally I believed it trueThat all who fell in love were foolishBut I was wrongI've learned that lesson wellAll the way back home at midnightYou were sleeping on my shoulderTake my handDon't think of obligationsNow, right nowYour love is liberationTo free in meThe trust I never daredI always thought the risk too greatBut suddenly I don't hesitate soTake my handDon't think of complicationsNow, right nowYour love is liberationLiberationThe night, the starsA light shone through the darkAll the way back home at midnightYou were sleeping on my shoulderTake my hand,Don't think of hesitationNow, right nowYour love is liberationLiberationBack home at midnightAll the way back home at midnight
