Late last night I was looking through picturesFlooded with memories, I lied on the floorAnd spread them around me like friends at a partyTheir faces remind me of all that I've knownStill, I can't forget all the hushed who and whysAll the fiction and lies, all the tears and the laughsTake a walk through the past, you and I, hand in handAs we look at this thing called usLate last night I was pacing the hallwayReading the letters you'd signed x and oI turned out the lights and imagined you with meI tried my hardest to cry, but it just wouldn't comeStill, I can't forget all the hushed who and whysAll the fiction and lies, all the tears and the laughsTake a walk through the past, you and I, hand in handAs we look at this thing called usAll the hushed who and whysAll the fiction and lies, all the tears and the laughsTake a walk through the past, you and I, hand in handAs we look at this thing called trustStill, I can't forget all the hushed who and whysAll the fiction and lies, all the tears and the laughsTake a walk through the past, you and I, hand in handAs we look at this thing called usAll the hushed who and whysAll the fiction and lies, all the tears and the laughsTake a walk through the past, you and I, hand in handAs we look at this thing called trust
