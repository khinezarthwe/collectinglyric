Lord take me homeTo the peaceful valleyDown the winding riverTo your city your soulI've grown so tiredAnd my hearts grown heavyTo walk any longerTo your cities of GoldAll my life I've loved for forgivenessBut I can never seem to get enoughAll my life I've been rocked into the darknessWith a gun to my headTrying to find a peaceful songTrying to find a peaceful songTo sing when everything goes wrongTill the peaceful valley calls me homeUp there in the cloudsIn that glorious kingdomTell me there ain't nothing but an easy reclineCan I still smoke cigarettes and have my coffeeUp there in heaven and a bottle of wineCause all my life, I've longed for forgivenessBut I can never seem to get enoughAll my life I've been locked into the darknessWith a gun to my headTrying to find a peaceful songTrying to find a peaceful songTo sing when everything goes wrongTill the peaceful valley calls me homeOh take me home to the peaceful valleyDown the winding riverTo the city of Gold
