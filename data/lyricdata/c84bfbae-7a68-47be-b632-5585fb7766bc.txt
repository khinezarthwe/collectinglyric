It's been a while since the two of us talkedAbout a week since the day that you walkedKnowing things would never be the sameWith your empty heart and mine full of painSo explain to me, how it came to thisTake it back to the night we kissedIt was Dublin city on a Friday nightYou were vodkas and coke, I was Guinness all nightWe were sitting with our backs against the worldSaying things that we thought, but never heardWho would have thought it would end up like this?Where everything we talked about is goneAnd the only chance we have of moving onIs try to take it backBefore it all went wrongBefore the worst, before we mendBefore our hearts decideIt's time to love againBefore too late, before too longLets try to take it backBefore it all went wrongThere was a time, that we'd stay up all nightBest friends talking 'til the daylightTook the joys alongside the painWith not much to lose, but so much to gainAre hearing me? 'Cause I don't wanna miss,Set you a drift on memory blissIt was Grafton Street on a rainy nightI was down on one knee and you were mine for lifeWe were thinking we would never be apartWith your name tattooed across my heartWho would have thought it would end up like this?Where everything we talked about is goneAnd the only chance we have of moving onIs try to take it backBefore it all went wrongBefore the worst, before we mendBefore our hearts decideIt's time to love againBefore too late, before too longLet's try to take it backBefore it all went wrongIf the clouds don't clearThen well rise above it, well rise above itHeaven's gate is so nearCome walk with me throughJust like we used to, just like we used toLet's take it backBefore it all went wrongBefore the worst, before we mendBefore our hearts decideIt's time to love againBefore too late, before too longLet's try to take it backBefore it all went wrongLet's try to take it back before it all went wrong
