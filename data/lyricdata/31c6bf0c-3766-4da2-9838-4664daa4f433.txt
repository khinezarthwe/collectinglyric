She was stormin' through the house that day,An' I could tell she was leavin'.An' I thought: "Aw, she'll be back,"Till she turned around an' pointed at the wall an said:"That picture from our honeymoon,"That night in Frisco Bay:"Just give it away."She said: "Give it away.""An' that big four-poster king-size bed,"Where so much love was made:"Just give it away."She said: "Just give it away.""Just give it away."There ain't nothin' in this house worth fightin' over."Oh, an' we're both tired of fightin' anyway,"So just give it away."So I tried to move on,But I found that each woman I held,Just reminded me of that day.Hmmm.When that front door swung wide open,She flung her diamond ring:Said: "Give it away.""Just give it away."An' I said: "Now, honey, don't you even want,"Your half of everything."She said: "Give it away."Just give it away.Just give it away.There ain't nothin' in this house worth fightin' over.Oh, an' we're both tired of fightin' anyway,So just give it away.So I'm still right here where she left me,Along with all the other things,She don't care about anymore.Mmmm.Like that picture from our honeymoon,That night in Frisco Bay:She said: "Give it away."Well, I can't give it away.An' that big four-poster king-size bed,Where all our love was made:She said: "Give it away."Well, I can't give it away.I've got a furnished house, a diamond ring,An' a lonely broken heart,Full of love,An' I can't even give it away.
