Standing at the bus stopWith my shopping in my handsWhen I'm overhearing elderly ladiesAs the rumours start to flyHear them in the school yardIn the scrap yard, in the chip shopIn the phone box, in the pool hallAt the shoe stall, every corner turned aroundIt started with a school girl who was runningRunning home to her mam and dadTold them she was playingIn the change room of her local football sideThey said tell us again, she told them againThey said tell us the truth, they find it hard to believeCause he taught our Steve, he even trained meTaught Uncle John, who's a father of threeIt only takes one treeTo make a thousand matchesOnly takes one matchTo burn a thousand treesYou see him in the class room, in the swimming poolWhere the match stick men are madeAt the Scout's hall, at the footballWhere the wise we trust are paidThey all honour his name, he did a lot for the gameHe got his name knocked up above the sports ground gatesNow they're ripping them down, stamping the groundPicture gathers dust in the barIt only takes one treeTo make a thousand matchesOnly takes one matchTo burn a thousand treesWake up and smell the rainShake up, he's back to stayHe hasn't been on a holidayGrowing seeds don't believeWhy he's been away, in the school yardChange room, playing fieldsBathroom, phone boxOffice blocks, corners turned aroundThey keep doubting the flame, tossing the blameGot his name knocked up above the sports ground gatesNow they're ripping them down, stamping the groundPictures gathers dust in the bar in the loungeIt only takes one treeTo make a thousand matchesOnly takes one matchTo burn a thousand trees
