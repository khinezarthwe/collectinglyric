My dear, I've painted a pictureI've painted a picture for the questioned wallI'll hang it up with the rest soon right up with the next few that come alongOne more, there's room for just one moreOnce more make room for just one moreMy dear, you'll see I've enlisted the colors I've lifted from the world we've sharedI awake, climb into a good mood while up in the front room arranging chairsOne more, there's room for just one moreOnce more make room for just one moreIt's just enough, but it goes on and onA touch too much, yeah, it goes on and onIt's just enough, but it goes on, and in a touch enoughIs too much, but oh, wellIf these walls, they could tellThey'd say, "what's the fuss?Well, you worry too much"From what I, what I can tellThere's enough space up thereThough in time it'll disappear, I'll enjoy being hereOne more, there's room for just one moreOnce more, make room for just one moreOne more
