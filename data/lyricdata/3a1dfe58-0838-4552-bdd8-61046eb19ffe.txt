All hail the unseen one who dances in the shadows.Hidden from everyone in a veil of joyousness.Bathing in the darkness exuding from the very bowels of mankind.With such longanimity had he tolerated the atrocity known as man.And when the world finally comes to an end,He'll simply laugh and smile for he would take such comfort,In knowing that there would be no tomorrow.He'd take such comfort in knowing we will never see another day.And for their degeneration,Mankind will finally know what it means to suffer.Understand that he is hopeless.He is bitter, and he is filled with great spite.From witnessing first hand man's decline,He is simply hopeless, he is bitter and filled with great spite.And when the world finally comes to an end,He'll simply laugh and smile for he would take such comfort,In knowing that there would be no tomorrow.Here's bidding farewell to a loathsome world
