Goodbye to you my trusted friendWe've known each other since we were nine or tenTogether we've climbed hills and treesLearned of love and ABCsSkinned our hearts and skinned our kneesGoodbye my friend, it's hard to dieWhen all the birds are singing in the skyNow that the spring is in the airPretty girls are everywhereThink of me and I'll be thereWe had joy, we had funWe had seasons in the sunBut the hills that we climbedWere just seasons out of timeGoodbye papa, please pray for meI was the black sheep of the familyYou tried to teach me right from wrongToo much wine and too much songWonder how I got alongGoodbye papa, it's hard to dieWhen all the birds are singing in the skyNow that the spring is in the airLittle children everywhereWhen you see them, I'll be thereWe had joy, we had funWe had seasons in the sunBut the wine and the songLike the seasons, have all goneWe had joy, we had funWe had seasons in the sunBut the wine and the songLike the seasons, have all goneGoodbye Michelle, my little oneYou gave me love and helped me find the sunAnd every time that I was downYou would always come aroundAnd get my feet back on the groundGoodbye Michelle, it's hard to dieWhen all the birds are singing in the skyNow that the spring is in the airWith the flowers everywhereI wish that we could both be thereWe had joy, we had funWe had seasons in the sunBut the stars we could reachWere just starfish on the beachWe had joy, we had funWe had seasons in the sunBut the stars we could reachWere just starfish on the beachWe had joy, we had funWe had seasons in the sunBut the wine and the songLike the seasons, have all goneAll our lives we had funWe had seasons in the sunBut the hills that we climbedWere just seasons out of timeWe had joy, we had funWe had seasons in the sun
