Someone please turn the lights back onI've been wandering here for days, disconnectedAnd in search for new air to breathe inI don't think I can fix thisDon't think I could changeBut that's the problemWe never speak to HimOur closing walls have caged us inAnd I can't quite rememberThis was the first time I didn't say enoughThis was the only time I kept it close enoughBrace yourself! They're not waking upOh, my GodI hate the me that I've becomeThis needy useless forgetting oneTruthfully I can't be the me that I've washed up to beDon't stop breathingThe walls have just begun to spinJust let the water calm you this timeIt's all around you, just open your eyes and take a lookIt will never kill you; not this timeIt's all around youWe're surrounded for all I careBrace yourself right nowLights out I'm not breathingI can't keep swimming, can't keep my head up
