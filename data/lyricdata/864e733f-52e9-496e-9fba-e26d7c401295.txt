You could've been all I wantedBut you weren't honestNow get in the groundYou choked off the surest of favorsBut if you really loved meYou would've endured my worldWell, if you're just as I presumedA whore in sheep's clothingFucking up all I doAnd if so here we stopThen never againWill you see this in your lifeHang on to the glory at my right handHere laid to rest, is our love ever longed?With truth on the shores of compassionYou seem to take premise to all of these songsYou stormed off to scar the armadaLike Jesus played letterÂ¹I'll drill through your handsThe stone for the curse you have blamed meWith love and devotionI'll die as you sleepBut if you could just write me outTo neverless wonderHappy will I becomeBe true that this is no optionSo with sin, I condemn youDemon play, demon outHang on to the glory at my right handHere laid to rest, is our love ever longed?With truth on the shores of compassionYou seem to take premise to all of these songsOne last kiss for youOne more wish to youPlease make up your mind, girlI'd do anything for youOne last kiss for youOne more wish to youPlease make up your mind, girlBefore I hope you die
