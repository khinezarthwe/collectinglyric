Seein' double, livin' singleNight club frustrated tryin' to mingleThere's a girl dancin' over thereShe's got very fascinating hairBut I can't work up the nerve to do my schpeelWith my big foot stuck in my mouthI end up talkin' like a heelCuz I'm a loser, not a schmoozerAnd a no luck in woman cruiserI'm a dog without a leash, a jigsaw puzzle lookin' for a pieceI'm a kid without a toy, I am the world's forgotten boyWhy can't I work up a silly nerve to talk no shitLike a square peg, stuck in a hole, I just don't fitCuz I'm a loser, not a schmoozerAnd a no luck woman cruiserNot a wheeler or a dealerShe's on a pedestal and I'm a kneelerI'm a loser and a boozerI'm a loser, not a schmoozerNever ever gonna be a chooserThe prince of fools, the king of painIt's enough to drive a poor man insaneI'm lookin' hard but I fearAnother lonely night bartender gimme a beerWhy do I even try, I get the same old lineShe said my boyfriend's much bigg than youI said what a waste of timeOh my God that girl just winked at meSo I worked up my courage, feels like I'm gonna peeI said baby, she just frozeShe said did your mother dress youWhere'd you get those clothes
