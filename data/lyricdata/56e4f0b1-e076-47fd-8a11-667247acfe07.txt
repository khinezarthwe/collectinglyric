There's a full moon over this ancient townA clock faced the colour of the skyAnd every street that we walk downBelongs to the house, where my father diedWhere prisoners march in lock-step with each otherReavers test the limit of their reignDragging their dead weight from the otherWhile I claim my place, centre stageI've been thrown by the thrashing of his goingChained to his unseen strideI've walked in lock-step without knowingMy indifference, my only disguiseNow it comes through me like an injectionAnonymous pain throbbing reel insideAnd every pulse in my bodyBelongs to the house, where my father diedWon't catch his spirit in a candleHonor a live in it's guttering glowAnd death comes through these streets like a scandalBent up and beaten, oh bitter body blowAnd in bars and in shaded back roomsThose who can't cope just get highBut every place this drink takes me toBelongs to the house, where my father diedAnd there's a full moon over this ancient townHead lights numb the banner of the skyRain rages the steadings and the open groundAnd I'm a child fighting shadows with tears in my eyesAnd the valley cannons in thunderTrees brawl beneath the bruising of the skyLike centuries shield the lake from my wonderAnd I'm as helpless as a child hiding from liesAnd the face from my mind is fadingI count the wounds for the very first timeTonight there's gonna be a reckoningI'm entering the house, where my father died
