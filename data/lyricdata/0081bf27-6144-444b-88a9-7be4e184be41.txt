Greasy jungle, metropolis noirEasy tangles the easiest so farI drove down your roadTo Hazeldean where I tastedYour funeral home'sSandwiches and coffeeI saw your hands meltInto one anotherI saw you grieve and growCare a lot about one anotherI stood at your sinkAnd I felt your warm waterI washed your dishesAnd I looked out your kitchen windowWhere I saw a soulfulGymnast melt in the air and shudderJust above the snowMaking moves that just weren't thereVelvet callowWith wet hands I turned out the lightsAnd breathing shallowHesitated then went upstairsWhere I picked up your housecoatDried my hands and touched your hairAnd just then you awokeYou could never really barely careGreasy jungle, metropolis noir
