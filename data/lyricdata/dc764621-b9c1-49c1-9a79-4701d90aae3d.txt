New blood joins this earthAnd quickly he's subduedThrough constant pained disgraceThe young boy learns their rulesWith time the child draws inThis whipping boy done wrongDeprived of all his thoughtsThe young man struggles on and on he's knownA vow unto his ownThat never from this dayHis will they'll take awayWhat I've feltWhat I've knownNever shined through in what I've shownNever beNever seeWon't see what might have beenWhat I've feltWhat I've knownNever shined through in what I've shownNever freeNever meSo I dub thee unforgivenThey dedicate their livesTo running all of hisHe tries to please them allThis bitter man he isThroughout his life the sameHe's battled constantlyThis fight he cannot winA tired man they see no longer caresThe old man then preparesTo die regretfullyThat old man here is meWhat I've feltWhat I've knownNever shined through in what I've shownNever beNever seeWon't see what might have beenWhat I've feltWhat I've knownNever shined through in what I've shownNever freeNever meSo I dub thee unforgivenWhat I've feltWhat I've knownNever shined through in what I've shownNever beNever seeWon't see what might have beenWhat I've feltWhat I've knownNever shined through in what I've shownNever freeNever meSo I dub thee unforgivenNever freeNever meSo I dub thee unforgivenYou labeled meI'll label youSo I dub thee unforgivenNever freeNever meSo I dub thee unforgivenYou labeled meI'll label youSo I dub thee unforgivenNever freeNever meSo I dub thee unforgiven
