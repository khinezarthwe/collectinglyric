Mine eyes have seen the gloryOf the sacred wunder-kindYou took me behind a dis-used railway lineAnd said: "I know a place where we can goWhere we are not known"And you gave me something that I won't forget too soonBut I can't believe you'd ever careAnd this is why you will never careThese things take timeI know that I'mThe most ineptThat ever steppedI'm spellbound but a woman dividesAnd the hills are alive with celibate criesBut you know where you came fromYou know where you're goingAnd you know where you belongYou said I was ill and you were not wrongBut I can't believe you'd ever careAnd this is why you will never careThese things take timeI know that I'mThe most ineptThat ever steppedOh the alcoholic afternoonsWhen we sat in your roomThey meant more to meThan any, than any living thing on earthThey had more worthThan any living thing on earthVivid and in your primeYou will leave me behindYou will leave me behind
