The day since I met herI can't believe it's trueShe came here from MemphisAcross the ocean sailing and I saw herAnd I pleaded, "Why do you come so far?"And she said, "Trying to get to youHow I tried to get to youTrying to get to you"I'm sending a letterI'll send it right to youI'll send it to MemphisI know that someday everything I needed and I wantedUsed to be that my head was hauntedAnd all these sirensThey make me madAnd all this violenceIt brings me downI feel strong, I feel lucky"Trying to get to you"Said, "I'm going to get to youTrying to get to you"
