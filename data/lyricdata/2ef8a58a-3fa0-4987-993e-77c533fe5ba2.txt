ahhh.. baby, i can hardly recognize myselfmmmmmmmm.... touch meThe light is going blue.Morning approaches.The pain's still here.I'm empty - empty - empty.Sounds of the world,Of laughter and tears.I've nothing left.I'm empty - empty - empty.Heaven is forbiddenBut I'm going soonKiss me one last timebefore i take my flesh awayHeaven is forbiddenBut I'm going soonKiss me one last timeKiss me one last timeI want wisdom on tap, flowing like waterstrange i want that becauseI'm empty - empty - empty.So now eat your words,I hope you choke.I feel nothing no more.I'm empty - empty - empty.ahhh.. baby, i can hardly recognize myselfmmmmmmmm.... touch meHeaven is forbiddenBut I'm going soonKiss me one last timebefore i take my flesh awayHeaven is forbiddenBut I'm going soonKiss me one last timeKiss me one last time
