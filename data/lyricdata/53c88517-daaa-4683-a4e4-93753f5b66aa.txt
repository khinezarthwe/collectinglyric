This is a ballad of my private thoughts, this is a ballad of sickening thoughtsMusic is nothing, just stands in the background, it's the ringing in your ears when you head hits the pillow, it's the ache in your brain when the nightclub is overIt's ups and downs, ups and downs, take my thoughts, take my thoughtsWhat to do, what to do? Taking off my trousers and you take off your socksYou can set the night on fire with a disco ball, a razor sharp haircutA little perfume and a racing pulse, and a WonderbraI hear that someone else is doing it for you but, hey now, I was there firstArea 51 is under my bed, extinct in the middle of winterYeah, so talented and beautiful, you're one in a million, my teeth shine like dead starsGod is running out, God is running, he sucks on his own sweat, it's been a hard days workMasturbation is better for girls with imaginationBig Brother keeps me company now
