All my saints have taken bribesSinging,All the angels taken divesLeaving you the only oneIf I loose a sequin here and thereMore salt than pepper in my hairCan I rely on you when all the songs are throughTo be for me the everthere, everthere?Slide into another bookNow and then laugh out loudThrow that very dirty lookWhich says,If I loose the sequence here and thereLess derring do than quiet careCan I rely on you for a good talking toTo be for me the everthere, everthere?If I loose a sequin here and thereAnd take my time on every stairCan I rely on you when this whole thing is throughTo be for me the everthere, everthere?
