The water's edge is where she waitsLost soul still wanderingMeant to dieBut she's stuck not crossing overThe other side is where he waitsHis spirit reaching outMeant to saveBut she's too scared to take his handLiving in a world without youDrowning in the pastIs living in no world at allSo now I call on youRemember me, I gave you lifeYou would not take itYour suffering was all in vainIt's almost over nowDon't turn your back on paradiseFeeling scaredShe's prepared to give up everythingShe can't standTo feel like half of her is fadingHe will choose the only wayTo rid her of her painTake her soul nowThe decision has been madeLiving in a world without loveA burden to my soulIs living in a worthless worldSo I will call on youRemember me, I gave you lifeYou would not take itYour suffering was all in vainIt's almost overRemember me, you were so youngHow could I tell you?Remember me, I am the oneWho saved your life that nightI was the onewho would not abandon youEven in death I was the onewho would not leave youI used my freedom to protect youAnd all the while direct youDo you remember me this time?Even in death I gave you lifeI gave you lifeI wanted to deserve a placeA place beside youThis time when I reached out my handIt reached all the way to heavenRemember me, I gave you lifeYou would not take itYour suffering was all in vainIt's almost over nowGoodbyeIt's almost over nowGoodbyeIt's timeI release you from this lifeDon't turn your back on paradise
