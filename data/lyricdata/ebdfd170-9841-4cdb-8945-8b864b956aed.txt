Cold fire, you've got everything but cold fireYou will be my rest and peace childI moved up to take a place, near youSo tired, it's the sky that makes you feel triedIt's a trick to make you see wideIt can all but break your heart, in piecesStaying back in your memoryAre the movies in the darkHow you moved is all it takesTo sing a song of when I lovedThe prettiest starOne day though it might as well be somedayYou and I will rise up all the wayAll because of what you areThe prettiest starStaying back in your memoryAre the movies in the pastHow you moved is all it takesTo sing a song of when I lovedPrettiest starOne day though it might as well be somedayYou and I will rise up all the wayAll because of what you areThe prettiest star
