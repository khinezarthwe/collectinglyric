I read the pages about meIn her autobiographyThey were brief and to the pointOur flesh, while you are getting dressedA memory that needs to be repressedI'll just wait until it's overSince you've gone away I never know just what to saySince you've gone away I never know just what to sayCause I like cars more than telephonesYour voice in my ear makes me feel so aloneTonight I'm gonna drive, the silver moon is shining brightOver the interstate, God saying hurry don't be lateSoon the sun will rise, that's when the romance diesAnd I'm just tired of running aroundI walked to get the mail todayI guess your letter never cameI'll just check again tomorrowA flash while you are getting dressedA memory that needs to be repressedI'll just wait without saying a wordSince you've gone away I never know just what to saySince you've gone away I never know just what to sayCause I like cars more than telephonesYour voice in my ear makes me feel so aloneTonight I'm gonna drive, the silver moon is shining brightOver the interstate, God saying hurry don't be lateSoon the sun will rise, that's when the romance diesAnd I'm just tired of running aroundBut fuck it, I love you even if, I'm gonna feel like shitBy the time I get to you, now the sky is turning blueThe stars they disappear one by one as the daylight nearsAnd yes you're in my head, but that doesn't make you hereAnd I've lost all my friends, but you're the one I miss the mostAnd now I'm almost there, yeah, I'm almost to the coastAnd if I had any notion of how I'm gonna drive my car acrossThe Atlantic Ocean I'd be fucking set
