I am exploring the insideI find it desolateI do implore these confinesNow as they penetrate, recreate meI'm hovering throughout timeI crumble in these daysI crumble, cannot, I cannot findReflection in these daysIf you listen, listen, listenListen close, beat by beatYou can hear when the heart stops, I saved the piecesWhen it broke, and ground them all to dustI am destroyed by the insideI disassociateHope to destroy the outsideIt will alleviate, elevate meLike water flowing into lungsI'm flowing through these daysLike morphine cuts through, through deadened veinsI'm numbing in these daysSo, if you listen, listen, listenListen close, beat by beatYou can hear when the heart stops, I saved the piecesWhen it broke, and ground them all to dustI know what died that nightIt can never be brought back to lifeOnce again, I knowI know what died that nightIt can never be brought back to lifeOnce again, I knowI know I died that nightAnd I'll never be brought back to lifeOnce again, I knowI know I died that nightAnd I'll never be brought back to lifeOnce again, I knowIf you listen, listen, listenListen close, beat by beatYou can hear when the heart stops, I saved the piecesWhen it broke, and ground them all to dustSo, if you listen, listen, listenListen close, beat by beatYou can hear when the heart stops, I saved the piecesWhen it broke, and ground them all to dust
