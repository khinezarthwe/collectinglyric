Just drifting along with the worldEvery motion is paranoid and paralyzingGive it up or give â€˜em hopeLet us all survive the wakeWe, we're a race, a human raceUnder the glass behind it allWatch us crawl so fearfullyI might be wrong after allBut weren't we just so delicate yesterdaySit back and think about itSleep it off, sleep on itCome to, and make your motionsListen upThere's a calling aheadA desperationA falling of manWe are all lost in the sound of separationHands in the air and love at our sidesThere's gotta be something biggerWith the beating in our throatsAnd the tremble in our gripThis can't be itI'll come up for peaceI'll come down for truthI'll give in, I'll give up for youThe floors are shakingAnd we've lost our stepOh Lord, have mercy on us all
