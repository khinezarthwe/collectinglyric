To see you when I wake upIs a gift I didn't think could be realTo know that you feel the same as I doIs a three-fold Utopian dreamYou do something to meThat I can't explainSo would I be out of lineIf I said I miss you?I see your picture, I smell your skinOn the empty pillow next to mineYou have only been gone ten daysBut already, I'm wasting awayI know I'll see you againWhether far or soonBut I need you to knowThat I care and I miss youMiss you
