I wake up in my room, with a desire to dreamof unfamiliar places and faces, never whatthey seemI get up to do the zombie dance, in my sleepa nocturnal chanceI feel the rise of the beast in my headMy mind is bleeding me eyes turnin' redConfusing faces of the people aroundinducing graces never hearing a soundChorus:Back to the wall with a crazy headMy mama's callin' for meMy head goes bang, bang, bang,I realize that i need to beStrange, derangedNightmare master, black dog bastardStrange, so strangeCome into my world and be insaneNow the voodoo queens are comin' after meThey caught me playin' with their dollsPins and needles prickin' my fleshNow i'm somewhere in pain nailed to the wallThe wind of change has now blown me awayI hear the growl of a pack of wild dogsI smell the rush of adrenalin blowI remember the cold cold feelin' of myI move my hands and fingers aroundlike i'm about to cast a spellYou ask the questions that make you wonderof the story i tellUnfamiliar places and faces, never what they seemChorus
