Splintered piece of glass falls in the seat and gets caughtThese broken windows, open locks, reminders of the youth we lostIn trying so hard to look away from youWe followed white lines to the sunsetI crash my car everyday the same wayTime to let this pass(the time it takes, the time it takes to let go)Time runs through our veins(it starts and stops and starts and stops again)We don't stand a chance in this threadbare time(the time it takes, the time it takes to let go)Time to let this pass(the time it takes, the time it takes to let go)Staring at the setting sunNo reason to come back againThe twilight world in blue and whiteThe needle and the damage doneI don't want to feel this way foreverA dead letter marked return to senderBroken watch you gave me turns into compassIt's two hands still point to the same time 12:03, our last goodbyeSo push the seats back a little furtherI can see the headlights comingSo push the seats back a little furtherRoll the windows down and take a breathI can see the headlights comingThey paint the world in red and broken glassTime to let this pass(the time it takes, the time it takes to let go)Time runs through our veins(it starts and stops and starts and stops again)We don't stand a chance in this threadbare time(the time it takes, the time it takes to let go)Time to let this pass(the time it takes, the time it takes to let go)Staring at the setting sunNo reason to come back againThe twilight world in blue and whiteThe needle and the damage doneI don't want to feel this way foreverA dead letter marked return to senderThe spinning hubcaps set the tempo for the music of a broken windowWith the cameras on the cameras clickWe open up the lens and can't stopStaring at the setting sunNo reason to come back againThe twilight world in blue and whiteThe needle and the damage doneI don't want to feel this way foreverwhen the lights are on the cameras clickwe open up the lens to broken glass(and it's over in a flash)Staring at the setting sunNo reason to come back againThe twilight world in blue and whiteThe needle and the damage doneI don't want to feel this way forevera dead letter marked return to sender(I'll never understand,Understanding in a car crash)In a crash
