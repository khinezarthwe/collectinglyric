Talk about humanity, what's wrong and what is rightYou take a human being and strip them of their lifeA tormented soul, trapped and left to decayIn a controlled environment to die in a demented wayDeath row, he's awating, time just drags byGas chamber awaits for him to pay for his crimeWhen will the madness end, will it be todayWhat terrible thoughts living day by dayChorus:The crime was committed, forever left condemnedLeft and forgotten, the fortune never endsSentenced to death, delayed for seventeen yearsLeft to go insane now death's his greatest fear15 thousand dollars monthly that we payTo keep him alive, now that's insaneInjustice prevails again, it's the American wayNo wonder we're in debt, why do we have to payIf the death penalty exists to make these convicts payKill them when convicted instead of awaitingTo wait seventeen years is totally inhumaneThe crime has lost its meaning, it's ruthless to be so vainRepeat chorusSolo: SkowronRepeat first verseRepeat chorus
