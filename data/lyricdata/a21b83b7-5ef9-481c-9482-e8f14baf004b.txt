[Slug]If I was a rich manI'd buy you some shoesTall boots for all the dirt you walk throughWhat would that do?Enable you to dealWithout schooling you on how to touch what's realAnd if I was a smart manI'd tell you everything that I knewAnd give it to you every time you need a talking toBut what would that do?Teach you my guidelinesSo you can be a cheerleader at your game on the sidelinesAnd if I was a driverI'd keep my headlights onTo see the difference between right and wrongI'd wear my seatbelt even when I'm in parkCause I don't trust the other fools that cruise through these partsAnd if I was a better cookI'd hook up a feastSet a table full of food for the children to eatI encourage the nourishment so we can breatheWith the knowledge that we got something accomplishedChorus:And if I was Santa Claus, I'd fight for the causeWouldn't expect nothing in returnI'd give you everything you want, I'd be everything you needSo you can take my hand and I can take the leadAnd if I was an honest manI would stop writing songsI'd break for a nervous breakdown for breakfastTell everyone I knew to stay away from making musicIt ain't nothing but a confusing mess (confusing mess)And if I was you, I wouldn't hear a word I saidWouldn't trust nothing to start it up inside my headI'd make a conscious effort to live insteadOf trying to kill the monsters that reside underneath the bedAnd if I was a hurt manI'd find a way to put my faithInto a woman that could take me from todayMaybeI need somebody that could save meFrom the parts of myself that keep making me crazyAnd if I was a wise manI'd climb to the top of the mountain peakTo think about strength versus weaknessI'd find a point that rests a couple of feet above your headAnd figure out how I could try to help you reach it(Ho ho ho)And if I did have a choiceI'd never want to live foreverJust let me have a voice so I can make my pointsI can't imagine running a race with no finish lineJust let me keep my pace and make to most of my timeI love giving but I'm bad at receivingThe truth is, I'd prefer to be the one bleedingBut I'm a paranoid that stays between play and workCautious and aware, 'cause I'm afraid of being hurtWhich brings me to the issueAnd that would be this:How often must I ask myself why I exist?I feel like a freak, this world is a circusJust trying to find myself as well as my purposeChorus:And if I was Santa Claus, I'd fight for the causeWouldn't expect nothing in returnI'd give you everything you want, I'd be everything you needAnd you can take my hand and I can take the lead (2x)I got nothing but giftsKeep it up in my witsGot me drunk on the fifthAnd now we're stuck in a ditchAnd as dumb as it getsI'mma run you some fibs (?)I wanna touch your lipsI wanna rub your hipsPut a glove on the fistFor the love that existsWe'll keep bumping the hitsTo get my bucket of chipsFrom the Bloods and the CripsTo the skateboarding chicksPut the Atmosphere on your Christmas wishlist (2x)(Ho ho ho ho)
