Favorite space is a palindromeWhere I tuck in a cannonballAnd I never have to shareAnd where nobody can seeI was just about to walk five miles in a dayShame is always bathed in light and it always looks the sameStrange nights locked insideI was waiting for a road aheadI was lying in my western bedClues and clues dressed in whiteDouble dreams tend to land big blowsAfter all with the evening ghostsThey were only there to break my toesLeft to wonder the indulgent chorePlead your case with a famous whoreLike will anybody see?Or would anybody care?I was just about to walk five miles in a dayBliss is always bathed in light but she never talks the sameStrange nights locked insideI was waiting for a road aheadI was lying in my western bedClues and clues dressed in whiteDouble dreams tend to land big blowsAfter all with the evening ghostsThey were only there to break my toes
