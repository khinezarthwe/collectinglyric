The first star I see may not be a starWe can't do a thing but waitSo let's wait for one moreAnd the time's such clumsy timeIn deciding if it's timeI'm careful but not sure how it goesYou can lose yourself in your courageWhen the time we have now endsWhen the big hand goes round againCan you still feel the butterflies?Can you still hear the last goodnight?And the mindless comfort growsWhen I'm alone with my big plansAnd this is what she said gets her through itIf I don't let myself be happy now then when?If not now when?When the time we have now endsWhen the big hand goes round againCan you still feel the butterflies?Can you still hear the last goodnight?I close my eyes and believeWherever you are, angel
