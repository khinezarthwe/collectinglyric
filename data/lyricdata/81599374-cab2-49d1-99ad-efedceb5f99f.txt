I've begun to question the ways you count your loveWe've been holding hands now for quite long enoughJust so happens that the way to this heart of mineMight seem a bit unusual so I'll lay it on the lineYou can sodomize meGet behind and ride meStuff your cock inside meProceed to fuck me blindlyYou might think I'm dirty if I let you have your wayThat's the way that boys and girls have been raised to playIf you can't control yourself in saying something moreI can think of things to do with that mouth of yoursYou can eat me outWith that dirty mouthThrow me on the couchDo it then get out...We don't have to do anything if you don't wantWe can just look into eachother's eyesAnd masturbateTwo three four!Promise not to take from you without me giving backLove is love is love is love but this just isn't thatTake a shower when we're done but this won't wash awayIf you keep me satisfied I might let you stayI will suck you offChoke me with your cockBlow it on my faceYour load I want to taste...
