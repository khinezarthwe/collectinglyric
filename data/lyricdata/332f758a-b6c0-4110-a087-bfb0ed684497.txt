Where will you be they tense for warfare?What will you see with your innocent stare?Where will you be my darling?Where will you be they tense for warfare?Where will you be when God is glorifying?There we will be between the dead and dyingWhere will you be my darling?Where will you be when God is calling for me?Prophecies of glory forge a massive disdainFor lying passive in the shadows whilst the enemy reignsDevoted to the votive, holy standard aboveBy command of the king of HeavenCame the death of... loveWhere will you be when they're vilifying?How will they see when the truth is blinding?Where will you be my darling?Where will you be when they vilify me?Where will you be when the dark is rising?How will you keep from its terrorizing?Where will you be my darling?Where will you be when the dark is rising?Burning was the sunset like a portent of doomOn the saintly iron maiden as she fell from her woundBut visions and ambitionNever listened to submissionAnd she was on a mission from the highest aboveTo Lord upon the slaughterLike a sword through hissing waterShe arose where archers sought herFor the death, the death of loveThe righteous death of loveGilles adored her dramaHer suit of pure white armorBlazed against the English in a torrent of lightAnd as they rallied onto nightA cancer fled his soulDissolvingFramed amidst the thick of fireAflame, a ValkyrieShe made him click without desireAnd in his eyes she swam a GoddessAnd even when they caught her breathHer words would leave a scarHow will you breathe when their wheels are turning?How will you know if the sky is burning?Where will you be my darling?How will you breathe when their wheels are turning?Where will you be when Babel builds my fire?Will you not flee and label me pariah?Where will you be my darling?Where will you be when they light my pyre?Aligned with Joan in all that was enthroned and divineHe swore to score the crimesJackdaws poured on this doveCrimes he knew alone derived from minds of the blindThe church unfurled for murder perched upon the death of loveFramed amidst the thick of fireAflame, a ValkyrieShe claimed the sky was lit with spiresAnd in his eyes she swam a GoddessAnd even when she fought, for breathHer words would leave a scar
