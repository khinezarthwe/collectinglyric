Yeah! Great skies of greenYeah! Great fields of blueYeah! Vast swathes of pinkWho put the fork in your tongue?Who broke the belt with a bang?Try to remember: 'Old dog, new tricks'Say it: "It's alright"It's not your name they're dragging through the mud, it's mineWho put the fork in your tongue?Who broke the belt with a bang?Try to remember your insularitySay it: "It's alright"It's not your name they're dragging through the mudForget to segregate yourselfForget to flagellate yourselfDoor meets door in the glamorous mansionForget to segregate yourselfForget to flagellate yourselfAnd it's teeming with shadows;Paralyzed minds make decisions in the darkWho put the fork in your tongue?Who broke the belt with a bang?Buy it, run it, kick it, fuck it, yeah.
