I don't wanna be a heroBut I'll stand and never kneelFreedom is well wort a dyingCome we'll fight with heart and steelBeat the English at Sterling bridgeI will guard the Scottish throneI myself skinned CressinghamIn his own blood he did drown(Chorus:)Fight - Freedom we fightStand - Scotland's prideI am just a simple manI'm afraid to meet my endBraveheart they call meIf they knew if they could seeEdward's out to seek revengeHis army's great his soldiers strongCome with me to fight at FalkirkSend them back where they belongI don't have the blood of kingsBut I'd die for Scotland's prideEven nobles follow meInto battle side by side(Chorus:)Fight - Freedom we fightStand - Scotland's prideNightmares haunt my lonely nightsI must be strong and I must fightBraveheart they call meIf they knew if they could see- Repeat first one -Vengeance burns a raging angerI have lost the fear to dieBraveheart that's what I amI kill until my blood runs dryThe lust for battle in my veinsinspires me to take your lifeBraveheart that's what I amI kill until my blood runs dry
