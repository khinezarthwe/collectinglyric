When you wake up in the fireAnd your harbor lies in ruinsYou wonder why the giant has been shotFired off down from the skyYou plead for explanationIs it accident or ruleAnd where is your childhood heroTo drive all the demons awayWhat if the lightShines in darkness my friendAnd darkness just can't comprehendSo blaze the trail on your ownGo it aloneWe are falling - falling to risePain is the guide out of the wastelandsWe don't need a heroWe are falling - falling to riseNo charlatan to show you the lightWe don't need a heroIndignity is the leaderTo escort us to fenWhere they say the light is endemicIf only I could comprehendNow you're old enough to face itRabble's stones give painHit you as they watch your tracksApart from the way that they understandWhat if the lightShines in darkness my friendAnd darkness just can't comprehendSo blaze the trail on your ownGo it aloneWe are falling - falling to risePain is the guide out of the wastelandsWe don't need a heroWe are falling - falling to riseNo charlatan to show you the lightWe don't need a heroOh we don't need a heroNo we don't need a hero
