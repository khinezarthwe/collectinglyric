Even at the end of a day run raggedBoxed in, locked out and haggardThere was the cluster of milky lightsOver the black hills; they ring this townAnd you knew they'd be comin' downYeah, you knew they'd be comin' downTo swing low over the maritimeSo thick, and without ageThere's a place where even the old and used can hideUntil the light spills out of the open doorAnd you feel young again at the offer of a rideOh yeah, here's your rideOh yeah, here's your rideOh yeah, here's your rideSurf's up, surf's up on sour shoresOh, on our sour shoresYou may black out your windows nowBut I have not forgotten yoursRain down, rain down on rotten doorsOn down our rotten doorsAnd in the night you step outsideAnd wonder what this life is forSo put your ear to the doorDo you remember how the clues were scatteredA curled note in a buried boxBone binding cracked from the years in the groundBut not shatteredOh, your grandfather knew what matteredYeah, he knew, and he left it to youSo clear your headForget your bed tonightGo where the sand glows black not red tonightIt's not a happy endingIt's just an escape from the lightAnd it's better than you ever readEven if it's only in your sleepy headSurf's up, surf's up on sour shoresOh, on our sour shoresYou may black out your windows nowBut I have not forgotten yoursRain down, rain down on rotten doorsOn down our rotten doorsOur wings may not be fit to flyBut you will be weightless at your coreOh yeah, here's your rideOh yeah, here's your rideOh yeah, here's your rideOh yeah, here's your ride
