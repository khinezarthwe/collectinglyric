I call ye cabin neighborsI call you once my friendsBut I trust when you laborAnd put my head to restBut I was on the hatchI was on the avalancheAnd I had found my matchI was on the floorI took a train from VirginiaTo Illinois, my homeHe said "I knew you had it in ya"A mind to make its ownBut I was on the hatchRiding on the avalancheI tried to take it backI was on the floorCome on, Stone!Come on, Star!Come on, Snow!Come on, Car!Come on, Hands!Come on, Feet!Come on, Face!Come on, Street!Come on, State!Come on, Song!Move it fast! (Take it up)Move it along! (The Ohio River)Come on, Life! (Take it up)Come on, Lord! (Take it over)Make it right! (To the Mississippi)Make it Yours!
