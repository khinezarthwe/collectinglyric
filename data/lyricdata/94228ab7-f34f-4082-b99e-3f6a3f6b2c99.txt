Oh look what just came rolling downThis morning's faceSome shining tears from sleepy eyesWon't go to wasteI've got a loose side frameBeen filling up with grainIn red with one wax pencilWe mark the time and dateI'm gonna turn this truck aroundWhen we run out of spaceYou say "Why can't you say more hopeful thingsAnd skies that go from gray to blue"I know my voice is like a broken sawI know my voice is like a tightening screwIf I could write a song of sweetness and light for youWell honey that's just the first thing that I would doThat I would doThere is a temperature where even weMust take the armor offA point at which the carapaceCan just dissolveAnd while the river risesCool and clear around our kneesWe'll watch while clouds that covered usAre broken by the breezeYou say "Why can't you say more hopeful thingsAnd skies that go from gray to blue"I know my voice is like a broken sawI know my voice is like a sickly shrewIf I could write a song of sweetness and light for youOh honey that's just the first thing that I would doThat I would doOh yeah I would do
