Sifting through theAshes of my lifeI thought I found the one thatI could always trustSlowly I began to learn thatI can never judge the thingsThat mean the most to meAnd all the hate and anger,That they all put on youYou just threw on me AndI don't believe thatI, could ever be with youAnd I don't believe that we,Could ever be togetherCalling out to you,Try to show the truthBut you just carry onKilling everything that we once hadAnd never really understanding whyAnd I don't believe thatI, could ever be with youAnd I don't believe that we,Could ever be togetherYou've taken everything andLeft me here with nothingAnd I don't believe thatI, could ever be with youAnd I don't believe that we,Could ever be together
