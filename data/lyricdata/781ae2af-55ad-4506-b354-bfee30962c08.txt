Sea Within a SeaSome say we walk aloneBarefoot on wicked stone no lightand sanctuary found never waits around awhileMarching to the seatheir dreams stay in the shadowstheir dreams stay firmly rooted in the shallowsSee the scraping skySee my destination there tonightSo say I walk alone barefooton wicked stone tonightWill you leap to followWill you turn and goWill your dreams stay rooted in the shallowsSee the scraping skyFar beyond the shallowsFar beyond the reaches of the shadowsThough youth may fade with boyhoodÂ´s caresNew fear will catch us unawaresI know it willSo you might saythe path we share is one of dangerand of fearuntil the end
