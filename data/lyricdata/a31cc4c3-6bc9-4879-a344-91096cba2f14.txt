This Romeo is bleedingBut you can't see his bloodIt's nothing but some feelingsThat this old dog kicked upIt's been raining since you left meNow I'm drowning in the floodYou see, I've always been a fighterBut without you, I give upI can't sing a love songLike the way it's meant to beWell, I guess I'm not that good anymoreBut baby, that's just meAnd I will love you, baby, alwaysAnd I'll be there forever and a day, alwaysI'll be there 'til the stars don't shine'Til the heavens burst and the words don't rhymeAnd I know when I die, you'll be on my mindAnd I'll love you, alwaysNow your pictures that you left behindAre just memories of a different lifeSome that made us laugh, some that made us cryOne that made you have to say goodbyeWhat I'd give to run my fingers through your hairTo touch your lips, to hold you nearWhen you say your prayers, try to understandI've made mistakes, I'm just a manWhen he holds you close, when he pulls you nearWhen he says the words you've been needing to hearI wish I was himWith these words of mineTo say to you 'til the end of timeThat I will love you baby, alwaysAnd I'll be there forever and a day, alwaysIf you told me to cry for you, I couldIf you told me to die for you, I wouldTake a look at my faceThere's no price I won't payTo say these words to youWell, there ain't no luckIn these loaded diceBut baby if you give me just one more tryWe can pack up our old dreamsAnd our old livesWe'll find a place where the sun still shinesAnd I will love you, baby, alwaysAnd I'll be there forever and a day, alwaysI'll be there 'til the stars don't shine'Til the heavens burst and the words don't rhymeI know when I die, you'll be on my mindAnd I'll love you, alwaysAlways, always
