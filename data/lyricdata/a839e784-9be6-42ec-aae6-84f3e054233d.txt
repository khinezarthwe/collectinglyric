Oh, girl, we are the sameWe are young and lost and so afraidThere's no cure for the painNo shelter from the rainAll our prayers seem to failIn joy and sorrow, my home's in your armsIn world so hollowIt is breaking my heartIn joy and sorrow, my home's in your armsIn world so hollowIt is breaking my heartOh, girl, we are the sameWe are strong and blessed and so braveWith souls to be savedAnd faith regainedAll our tears wiped awayIn joy and sorrow, my home's in your armsIn world so hollowIt is breaking my heartIn joy and sorrow, my home's in your armsIn world so hollowIt is breaking my heartAnd my home's in your armsAnd it is breaking my heartMy home's in your armsAnd it is breaking my heart
