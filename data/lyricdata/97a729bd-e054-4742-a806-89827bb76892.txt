(Norman Blake)I don't know if you can hear meI'm feeling down and can't think clearlyEven though it's complicatedWe've got time to start againI don't know if you can hear meSome things I'd change but it's too lateI'd take the past and make it straightEven though it's complicatedWe've got time to start againI don't know if you can hear meI'm sorry for the things I've saidBut some thoughts just won't leave my headEven though it's complicatedWe've got time to start againI don't know if you can hear meEven though it's complicatedWe've got time to start againI don't know if you can hear me
