Oklahoma, she won't be your friend,She waits at the disco for her song to end.Oklahoma, she must know my name,It's been six months nowI'm tired of this game.And I keep on trying not to go harder,Trying not to be smarter,Trying not to notice you.And I keep on trying not to go harder,Trying not to be smarter,But I can't go on.I miss my friends but I like her tone,Her eyes are black like telephonesAnd I try, and I try, and I try.Oklahoma, she won't be your friend,She waits at the disco for her song to end.Oklahoma, she likes to reflect,Ignores you at parties,What did you expect?And I keep on trying not to go harder,Trying not to be smarter,Trying not to notice you.And I keep on trying not to go harder,Trying not to be smarter,But I can't go on.I miss my friends but I like her tone,Her eyes are black like telephonesAnd I try, and I try, and I try.But I, I can't remember.
