Once upon a timeWhen the cold wind that blowsWhen the cold wind that blows in my heartIt was a summer breeze and sheWould meet me in Chinatown for opium and teaAnd she always brought me flowersBut I spared you those old balladsOr songs that I couldn't playBut every giro dayShe'd dress me like a lady boyAnd take me out of the wayDon't let the horse chase the new deal away, noIf we make love in the morningI see your eyes look like two marbles in your headLady don't you fall backwardsC'mon and fall into my armsAw, don't you fall backwardsWell, I wouldn't want for you to come to any harmNow tell me, if darkness comesThen I will sing you a songAnd I will love you foreverAt least 'til morning comesLady don't you fall backwardsCome on and fall into my armsCome on and fall into my arms
