She's got her eyes open wideShe's got the dirt and spit of the worldHer mouth on the metalThe lips of a scared little girlI've got an angel in the lobbyHe's waiting to put me in lineI won't ask forgivenessMy faith has gone dryShe's got her christian prescripturesAnd death has crawled in her earLike elevator music of songsThat she shouldn't hearAnd it spins around 1...2...3And we all lay down 4...5...6Some do it fastSome do it better in smaller amountsAnd it spins around 1...2...3And we all lay down 4...5...6Some do it fastSome do it better in smaller amounts
