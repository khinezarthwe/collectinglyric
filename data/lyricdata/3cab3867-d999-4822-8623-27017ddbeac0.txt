In this hole, that is meThe dead are rolling overIn this hole, thickeningDirt shoveled over shouldersI feel it in me, so overwhelmedOh, this pressure center, risingMy life overturned, unfair, the despairAll these scars keep ripping openPeel me from the skin, tear me from the rindDoes it make you happy now?Tear meat from the bone, tear me from myselfAre you feeling happy now?In this hole, that is meA life that's growing feebleIn this hole, so limitingThe sun has set, all darkensBuried underneath, hands slip off the wheelInternal pathway to contentionPeel me from the skin, tear me from the rindDoes it make you happy now?Tear meat from the bone, tear me from myselfAre you feeling happy now?Happy?Happy?Are you feeling happy?In this hole, that is meLeft with a heart exhaustedWhat's my release?  What sets me free?Do you pull me up just to push me down again?Peel me from the skin, tear me from the rindDoes it make you happy now?Tear meat from the bone, tear me from myselfAre you feeling happy now?Peel me from the skin, tear me from the rindDoes it make you happy now?Tear meat from the bone, tear me from myselfAre you feeling happy now?Does it make you happy?Are you feeling happy?Are you fucking happyNow that I'm lost, left with nothing?Does it make you happy?Are you feeling happy?Are you fucking happyNow that I'm lost, left with nothing?
