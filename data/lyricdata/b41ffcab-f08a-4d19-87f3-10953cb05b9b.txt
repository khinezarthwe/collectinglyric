Shake me into the night and I'm an easy loverTake me into the fight and I'm an easy brother and I'm on fireBurn my sweet effigy I'm a road runnerSpill my guts on a wheel I wanna taste uh-huh and I'm on fire, and I'm on fireAnd I'm on fire... (I'm going, you tell me, I feel it, I say itI'm heading back into the tunnel for my soul to burn)And I'm on fire... (I'm coming, you coming, no hiding, my feelingI wanna take it to the highest over me, yeah...)Wire me up to machines I'll be your prisonerFind it hard to believe you are my murdererI'm on fire behind you heads a fallen skyAnd I'm on fire... (I'm going, you tell me, I feel it, I say itI'm heading back into the tunnel for my soul to burn)And I'm on fire... (I'm coming, you coming, no hiding, my feelingI wanna take it to the highest over me, yeah...)And I'm on fire... I'm on fire... (Move on, you got to move onYou got to hit 'em to the hip and get your shake on)(Move on, you got to move onYou got to hit 'em to the hip and get your shake on)I feel it, I want it, I'm coming, I tell yaI caught the bullet from the heavens to the one you serveI'm going, I'm running, out to the highest loveI'm wanna hit you to the hip...I'm on fire... (Move on, you got to move onYou got to hit 'em to the hip and get your shake on)I'm on fire... (Move on, you got to move onYou got to hit 'em to the hip and get your shake on)
