When I was young I was differentThere was more inside of meSo alone, yet a sense of purposeThe guiding light of the order nurtured meDaunted by the truth revealedWhat am I? What's my destiny?A million souls, the priest incarnateI am the one, I am the astral beastI am the wicked, the dealer of fateHarbinger of sorrowI'm the assassin, the dealer of fateFraming man's tomorrowI thrive as the lone travelerThrough the folds of time and spaceThe chosen one to foreshadowThe hand of god will eradicate this raceI am the past, I'm the cure for sorrowI am the now, I'm of every ageI'm the future ending man's tomorrowThe hand of god, the harbinger of fateI am the wicked, the dealer of fateHarbinger of sorrowI'm the assassin, the dealer of fateFraming man's tomorrowKingdoms will fall, empires crumbleSeizing on the politics of hateI am the one, the devil in the detailsThe hand of god, the harbinger of fateI am the wicked, the dealer of fateHarbinger of sorrowI'm the assassin, the dealer of fateFraming man's tomorrow
