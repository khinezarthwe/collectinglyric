Take your anger out on meSlap me round no one can seeWe're the perfect familyMake up hides the scars dailyLiving under fear youHeavy hands make my skin blueSmile don't let the neighbours seeWe're the perfect familyKiss and make upKiss and make upKiss and make upKiss and make upIn this house the fights come moreScreaming has made my throat soreWhen it's all smashed and you tooThat's when the demons scream through youIf you're sick of me like i'm sick of youThen just pack your stuff you know just what to doDem der kind of ting I cannot take no moreAnd the way you gworn leaves me on the floorChorus(middle 8)Take your anger out on meSlap me round no one can seeWe're the perfect familyMake up hides the scars dailySick of you like you're sick of meThen just pack your shit and then let it beYou're abuse I can't take no moreAnd the way you gworn leaves me on the floorKiss and make upKiss and make upChorus(screaming outro)End
