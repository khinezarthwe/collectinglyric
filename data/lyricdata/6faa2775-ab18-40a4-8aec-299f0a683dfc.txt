Up All NightCan we talk about automatic satisfactionSittin' back relaxin' flooredWhat's wrong with kickin itWhen you're bored and litLets smoke some cigarettesAnd catch up on the back porchFire up another roachAnd we don't need a rest this is just a test(chorus)Cuz we're alright, we're up all nightTo see the sun come up again nowJust one more time no reason whyTo see the sun come up again.The more we try to changeThe more we stay the sameWe're caught up in the game and nowIt's like empty picture framesSo now we're to blameSaid we were gettin down, on Genesee and FountainSmoke another mountain outIf you aint gettin down, then you'll come aroundYeah yeah yeahAnd were alright, we're up all nightTo see the sun come up again nowJust one more time, no reason whyTo see the sun come up again.So lets smoke some cigarettesAnd catch up on the back porchFire up another roachAnd we don't need a rest, it's just a testAnd as the world spins we'll watch it with a grinAnd look in as the day beginsWell now it's on again, it's dawn again. Yeah! Yeah!And we're alrightWe're up all nightTo see the sun come up again nowJust one more time, no reason whyTo see the sun come up againYeah we're alright, we're alrightWe're alright, up all nightYeah we're alright, we're alrightTo see the sun come up again now!
