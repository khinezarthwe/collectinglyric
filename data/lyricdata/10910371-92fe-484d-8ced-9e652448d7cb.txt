She's not afraid; she just likes to use her night lightWhen she gets paid, true religion gets it allIf they fit right.She's a little bit manic, completely organicDoesn't panic for the most part.She's old enough to know, and young enough not to say noTo any chance that she gets for home plate tickets to see the Mets.Like everybody, she's in over her head,Dreads Feds, Grateful Dead, and doesn't take meds.She's a Gemini CapricornThinks all men are addicted to porn.I don't agree with her half the time,But, damn I'm glad she's mine.Her eyes, that's where hope lies.That's where blue skiesMeet the sunrise.Her eyes, that's where I goWhen I go home.She got the kinda strength that every man wishes he had.She loved Michael Jackson up until he made Bad.Tells me that she lives about a hundred lives,Scares me to death when she thinks and drives,Says cowboy hats make her look fat,and I'm so glad she's mine.Her eyes, that's where hope lies.That's where blue skiesMeet the sunrise.Her eyes, that's where I goWhen I go home.She doesn't know the word 'impossible'Don't care where I've been and doesn't care where we're goin' to.She takes me as I am, and that ain't easy.She's beautiful. So beautiful.And sometimes I think she's truly crazy.And I love it.Her eyes, that's where hope lies.That's where blue skiesAlways meet the sunrise.Her eyes, that's where I goWhen I go home.Her eyes, that's where hope lies.That's where blue skiesAlways meet the sunrise.Her eyes, that's where I goWhen I go home.She's not afraidshe just likes to use her night light.
