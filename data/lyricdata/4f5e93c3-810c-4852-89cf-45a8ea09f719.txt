The air is unbearably harmful tonightTake me away from these old city lightsAnd I would be better offWith your lovely limbs just wrapped around me tonightThis love is unbearably harmful tonightShould we call it quitsAnd end it for the nightCould we be better off with someone else just wrapped around us tonight
