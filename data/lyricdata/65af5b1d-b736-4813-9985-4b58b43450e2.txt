Jack be nimble Jack, Jack be quickJack jumped right over the candle stickTo a flame he chose had a name called hellWhere the devils child drank blood and was always wellJack lived simple with his lady JillTill he come on home his heart she stoleHe caught her messing with another manSo he got his gun and shot them downClose to Jill lying thereAll aloneHe lost his mind beneath the stairsAll aloneJack be nimble Jack, Jack be quickJack jumped right over the candle stickClose to Jill his broken crownAll aloneSee the growth stalk the goatAll aloneWe were young (Repeat until end)
