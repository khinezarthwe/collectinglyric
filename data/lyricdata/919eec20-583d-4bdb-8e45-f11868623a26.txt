My world astir and sicklySpits out our voices singing"Tra la la la," on high nowTo kingdom come so slightlyHerein a void in your placeI twitch and tweak in allusionTo sit and stare so blanklyUntil all hope is used upWhy do I always need to need you when you're fleeting?Where do you go when I'm around?What have I done, what have I lost that's so defeating?And have the nerve to wear a crown?Oh, na na na na na na, hey hey heyOh, na na na na na na, hey hey heyOh, na na na na na na, hey hey heyOh, na na na na na na, hey hey heyIn some dark roomA smoky figure fills me fullMakes my head swell in ruinMy family kneels at their pewThey nod, "We believe in what you're doing"I feel it rise above meThe western landscapes toweringAnd from my shell of a bodyThe flowers blossom for pickingWhy do I always need to need you when you're fleeting?Where do you go when I'm around?What have I done, what have I lost that's so defeating?And have the nerve to wear a crown?Oh, na na na na na na, hey hey heyOh, na na na na na na, hey hey heyOh, na na na na na na, hey hey heyOh, na na na na na na, hey hey heyOh, na na na na na na, hey hey heyOh, na na na na na na, hey hey heyOh, na na na na na na, hey hey heyOh, na na na na na na, hey hey heyI've waited and waited for someone to take itDon't fight it don't bother, an inch for anotherDon't listen, don't hear them, they're in this togetherI've learned well now hear me, there's much to be fearingI'm used to your absence, your faceless distractionsOh, na na na na na na, hey hey hey (in background until end)I've painted your patterns but found them attractiveNow I've been leaning toward a life far more candidThough lead through the dark with your eyes as my candlesWhere you're life and my life's directions can wrangleAnd all of a sudden you've left me to handleThe reasons that never forbid me to stand tallAnd somehow or somewhere I found out the secretTo staying alive without actually breathing
