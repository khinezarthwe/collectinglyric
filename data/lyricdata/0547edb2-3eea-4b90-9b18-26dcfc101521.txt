Tell me where our time went, and if it was time well spentJust don't let me fall asleep, feeling empty again'Cause I fear I might break and I fear I can't take itTonight I'll lie awake, feeling emptyI can feel the pressure, it's getting closer nowWe're better off without youI can feel the pressure, it's getting closer nowWe're better off without youNow that I'm losing hope and there's nothing else to showFor all of the days that we spent carried away from homeSome things I'll never know and I had to let them goI'm sitting all alone, feeling emptyI can feel the pressure, it's getting closer nowWe're better off without youI can feel the pressure, it's getting closer nowWe're better off without you(Without you)Some things I'll never know and I had to let them goSome things I'll never know and I had to let them goBut I'm sitting all alone, feeling emptyI can feel the pressure, it's getting closer nowWe're better off without youFeel the pressure, it's getting closer nowYou're better off without me
