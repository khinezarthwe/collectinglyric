Gotta get in on the scene hunVoice activate machineGot ya hair in a haircutYou gotta fill up the dreamGot ya finger on the pulse babeGot your rock n roll on?You wanna screw driver too nowI hear they're fun onYou got it all this side upBut ya ain't got it down!Push the pedal nowActivate your sweet voice babeLet your world come outGet ya head off the chopping blockGet ya Ouija board outGot ya rubber on ya pencilIn case you make a mistakeI hope ya got it all down babeI'd hate to think you're a fakeYou got it all this side upBut ya ain't got it down!Push the pedal now
