I am the darknessBorn out of lightI am the force, the fireThat burns here tonightBringing the futureTo all mankindGuider of life, of deathThe sight for the blindYour future lies within my eyesWhat I predict will terrifyI can't control what comes to beFrom the past to the present to eternityI am NostradamusDo you believe?I am NostradamusThat I conceiveMaster of chaosAnger and rageI hold the keyMy presence will unlock the cageI am your witnessThe one who can tellBearing the sword, the shieldTo your heaven from hellAs I unfold the mysteryI change the course of historyWith premonitions from the voidWill you live? Will you die?Will your worlds collide?I am NostradamusThe hand of fateI am NostradamusWith love and hateLost in this vortexThe mystery beginsWill you be victimSaved from your sinsTime is illusionTrapped in the skiesDestiny's callingHere from my eyesI am NostradamusDo not forsakeI am NostradamusYour life's at stakeI am NostradamusThe lightning rodI am NostradamusThe voice of GodCelestial cometsReign towards earthAlchemy's tempestPredicting your worthPray for deliveranceEscape if you canFor I have borne witnessTo the purging of man
