I have scars, I feel the painI'm that close from going insaneThis gun I have is the only wayTo get me through another dayBACK TO HELLLight and smoke fill the skiesBringing vengeance to my eyesWhere can I run where can I goHell is the only home I knowBACK TO HELLMy mind has been glazed with liesI'm a killer in disguiseCrushing victims like a viseTrained for years to be preciseI lost the battle and the warSocial outcast to the coreFalling deeper in a evil wellIt seems I left and went back to hellBACK TO HELL
