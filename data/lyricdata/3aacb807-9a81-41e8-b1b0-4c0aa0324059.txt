I'm not reaching youEverything you doLeads to my disgraceShow me your faceI can see myself inside of youI can see myself inside of youWhat's beneath the fleshHate you can't expressI can trick myselfLike everybody else..I can see myself inside of youI can see myself inside of youLook inside my headImbedded with the knowledgeDeep within my skinThat I will never know where to beginYou image is above meFar beyond my reachI stand alone and wait for you to teachI'm obessed with everything you doI won't stop until you say its throughI can see myself inside of youI can see myself inside of you
