You're in for surpriseYou're in for a shockIn London town streetsWhen there's darkness and fogWhen you least expect meAnd you turn your backI'll attackI smile when I'm sneakingThrough shadows by the wallI laugh when I'm creepingBut you won't hear me at allAll hear my warningNever turn your backOn The RipperYou'll soon shake with fearNever knowing if I'm nearI'm sly and I'm shamelessNocturnal and namelessExcept for "The Ripper"Or if you like, "Jack the Knife"Any back alley streetIs where we'll probably meetUnderneath a gas lampWhere the air's cold and dampI'm a nasty surpriseI'm a devil in disguiseI'm a footstep at nightI'm a scream of the frightAll hear my warningNever turn your backOn The RipperThe RipperThe RipperAh
