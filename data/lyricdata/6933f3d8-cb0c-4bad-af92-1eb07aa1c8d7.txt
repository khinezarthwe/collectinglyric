A quoted clever line like hopeI'll take the final words you wroteTo make them feel like blissAs always as I'll take the praiseI have a way with making thingsScripted like a song that makes you stingI need you here with meSo here's a heart to heartOn the back of postcards in from CaliforniaRemember when I saidJust stay, you're what you areI know you hate the feeling when I walk awayWhen I'm without you I'm not the man that I knew I can beBecause your not here with meYou can break my heart openAnd ruin my epic endingYou hand like a noose around my neckBut the next time you say"Promise me"I'll makeOne for myself to always stay what I amI need you here with meSo here's a heart to heartOn the back of postcards in from CaliforniaWhen I'm without you I'm not the man that I knew I can beBecause your not here with meI need you here with meSo here's a heart to heartOn the back of postcards in from CaliforniaWhen I'm without you I'm not the man that I knew I can beRemember when I saidJust stay, you're what you areI know you hate the feeling when I walk awayWhen I'm without you I'm not the man that I knew I can beBecause your not here with me
