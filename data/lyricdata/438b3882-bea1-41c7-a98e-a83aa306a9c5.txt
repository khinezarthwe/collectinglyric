Your precious love - that means so muchWill it ever stop or will I just lose touchWhat I want to say - but my words just failIs that I need it so I can't help myselfLike a hungry child - I just help myselfAnd when I'm all full up - I go out to playBut I don't mean to bleed you dryOr take you over for the rest of your lifeIt's just that I need something solid in mineLonely as the moors on a winter's morningQuiet as the sea on a good calm nightIn your tranquil shadow - I try and followI hear your distant show clicksTo the midnight beat -I feel trapped in sorrowIn this imageryBut that's how I am and why I need you so
