Why, tell me the reasons whyTry, still I don't understandWill I ever feel this againBlue sky, I'll meet you in the endFree them, free the memories of youFree me, and rest 'til I'm with youA day like todayMy whole world has been changedNothing you sayWill help ease my painTurn, I'll turn this slowly roundBurn, burn to feel alive againShe, she'd want me to move onSee me, this place I still belongGive chase, to find more than I have foundAnd face, this time now on my ownDays disappearAnd my world keeps changingI feel you hereAnd it keeps me saneSo I'm moving onI'll never forgetAs you lay there and watched meAccepting the endI knew you were scaredYou were strong, I was tryingI gave you my handI said it's okay letting go time to leave hereAnd I'll carry onThe best that I can without you here beside meLet him come take you home
