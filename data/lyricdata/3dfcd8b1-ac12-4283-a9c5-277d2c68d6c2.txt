Must've been mid afternoonI could tell by how far the child's shadow stretched out andHe walked with a purposeIn his sneakers, down the streetHe had many questionsLike children often doHe said:Tell me all your thoughts on GodTell me am I very farMust've been late afternoonOn our way the sun broke free of the cloudsWe count only blue carsSkip the cracks in the streetAnd ask many questionsLike children often doWe said:Tell me all your thoughts on God'Cause I'd really like to meet herAnd ask her why we're who we areTell me all your thoughts on God'Cause I'm on my way to see herSo tell me am I very far,Am I very far now?It's getting cold, picked up the pace!How our shoes make hard noises in this place!Our clothes are stainedWe pass many cross-eyed peopleAnd ask many questionsLike children often doTell me all your thoughts on God'Cause I'd really like to meet herAnd ask her why we're who we areTell me all your thoughts on God'Cause I'm on my way to see herSo tell me, am I very far?We're not very far nowWe're not very far now (Tell me all your thoughts on God)We're not very far now(Tell me all your thoughts on God)(Tell me all your thoughts on God)
