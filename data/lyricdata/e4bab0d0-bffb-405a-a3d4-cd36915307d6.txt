Love my superstitious gamesRunning circles round my brain when I'm left smilingI love to steal this living steamMy head in someone's dreamI'm tired of sleepingCall me crank, my ideaCrank, so superCrank, my conscience clearI build my canopy of steelIt fulfills my sense of realA chrome protectionCall me crank, my ideaCrank, so superCrank, my conscience clearIt's clearIn this small partition, like a prisonExplode time bombIf you know where I come fromYou call me crank, my ideaCrank, so superCrank, my conscience clearPlease call me crank, it's what I needCrank, my mind in seedCrank, my dream completeLay down, lay down, lay down
