So, Cinderella sold her soulThere's no such thing as rock and rollWe all stood in the queue and sold our heartsI think there was an accidentThey came as quickly as they wentNow I'm half a million miles up in the skyStanding on the last starStanding on the last starSpinning aroundStanding on the last starStanding on the last starFeeling downTrying to find the groundDon't cryDon't cryI know it'll be alrightI've been tryingI've been tryingTo tell myself that all nightIf this is the end of historyThe final accountNobody to pin your hopes onNo money to countNot even lips to say goodbyeStanding on the last starStanding on the last starIn the skyStanding on the last starStanding on the last starThere's no decent reason whyStanding on the last starStanding on the last starWaiting to dieSomebody left the taps on in the skyOh, tell meWill nothing in the world ever make you happy?Will nothing in the world ever make you happy?Is nothing in the world gonna make you happy?Is nothing in the world gonna make you happy?Will nothing in the world ever make you happy?Will nothing in the world ever make you happy?Is nothing in the world gonna make you happy?Is nothing in the world gonna make you happy?Will nothing in the world ever make you happy?Will nothing in the world ever make you happy?Is nothing in the world gonna make you happy?Is nothing in the world gonna make you happy?
