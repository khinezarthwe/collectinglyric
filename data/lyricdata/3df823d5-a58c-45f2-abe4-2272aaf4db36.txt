RainComing to cleanseWill she fall?StaresInto the windAnd she criesHer tears mark every timeThat I swept the pain asideToo much to withstandWhen the Rain is comingShe will face it allIt's all on me, all overAnd when it's overflowingCan she break her fall?Until I deal, I can't move onRainComing to ventAll she hidesUnavle to moveThough we tryHer feet off of the groundMy will can bring them downIf i'd open my eyesWhen the Rain is comingShe will face it allIt's all on me, all overAnd when it's overflowingCan she break her fall?Until I deal, I can't move onCan the sun break, through the cloudsTo reveal what we've found?When the Rain is comingShe will face it allIt's all on me, all overAnd when it's overflowingCan she break her fall?Until I deal, I can't move onAnd when the Rain is comingWhen it's overflowingAnd when the pain is showingWhen the Rain is comingFlowing down
