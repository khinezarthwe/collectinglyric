Oh, Sunday morning not a scrap in sightI'll go without, I do it out of spite, all by myself, yeahFood's lost it's flavour, I refuse to biteDo myself no favours, I stay in every night, ashtrays in rows, but you knowI feel alright, it's just another Sunday morning, then it's Sunday nightI feel alright, it's just the ghost of you behind me sitting right up tightI'll read the paper, but it's yesterdaysThe world's gone mad and I'm going the same way, all by myself, yeahWhen the sun is shining, but it don't give no hopeI'm into whining, and I'm all out of soup but it's good to feel dirty, yeahWhen you feel alright just another Sunday morning, everything's alrightI feel alright, it's just the ghost of you behind meSitting right up tight, sitting right up tightSo many miles, between me and youSo many days, I don't know what to do, be by myself, then I knowI'll be alright on another Sunday morning, another Sunday nightI'll be alright with the ghost of you behind me sitting right up tightSitting right up tight, sitting right up tight, sitting right up tight
