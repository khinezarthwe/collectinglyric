I was hanging out on the corner of the streetWith my hands in my pockets just staring at my feetListening to the Beatles from the burnt up radioI bought it for a dollar from a man in TerrigalSifting through my sorrow, I never felt so lowDrowning like a lizard, a human puppet showStanding at the peak of my bottom-dwelling selfThinking when’s this gonna stop, and is it time for hell?And I just can’t figure it outDid I make a mistake somehow?Oh, I wish there was a cheap way outI’m supposed to figure out tomorrowBut all that I can think about is yesterdayI’m supposed to figure out tomorrowBut all that I can think about is yesterdayFeeling like a failure, I wander down the streetTripping over on my hopelessness and burnt realityLaying on the side of the road I was afraidThat I may never get up again and never feel the sameShe took hold of my hand, she never let it goShe picked up all the pieces, she’s my Marilyn MonroeStanding at the side where she looked into my eyesAnd she told me not to worry and to hold my head up highAnd I just can’t figure it outDid I make a mistake somehow?Oh, I wish there was a cheap way outI’m supposed to figure out tomorrowBut all that I can think about is yesterdayI’m supposed to figure out tomorrowBut all that I can think about is yesterdayTomorrow won’t be easy, and neither will todayI wanted to close my eyes and dream of yesterdayBut I won’t do that, no I won’t do thatI can’t do that anymoreI’m supposed to figure out tomorrowBut all that I can think about is yesterdayI’m supposed to figure out tomorrowBut all that I can think about is yesterday.
