Finally the hills are without eyesThey are tired of painting a dead man's face redWith their own bloodThey used to love having so much to loseBlink your eyes just once and see everything in ruinsDid you ever hear what I told youDid you ever read what I wrote youDid you ever listen to what we playedDid you ever let in what the world saidDid we get this far just to feel your hateDid we play to become only pawns in the gameHow blind can you be, don't you seeYou chose the long road but we'll be waitingBye bye beautifulBye bye beautifulJacob's ghost for the girl in whiteBlindfold for the blindDead siblings walking the dying earthNoose around a choking heartEternity torn apartSlow toll now the funeral bells"I need to die to feel alive"Did you ever hear what I told youDid you ever read what I wrote youDid you ever listen to what we playedDid you ever let in what the world saidDid we get this far just to feel your hateDid we play to become only pawns in the gameHow blind can you be, don't you seeYou chose the long road but we'll be waitingBye bye beautifulBye bye beautifulBye bye beautifulBye bye beautifulIt's not the tree that forsakes the flowerBut the flower that forsakes the treeSomeday I'll learn to love these scarsStill fresh from the red-hot blade of your wordsHow blind can you be, don't you seeHow blind can you be, don't you seeHow blind can you be, don't you seeThat the gambler lost all he does not haveDid you ever hear what I told youDid you ever read what I wrote youDid you ever listen to what we playDid you ever let in what the world saidDid we get this far just to feel your hateDid we play to become only pawns in the gameHow blind can you be, don't you seeYou chose the long road but we'll be waitingBye bye beautifulBye bye beautifulBye bye beautifulBye bye beautiful
