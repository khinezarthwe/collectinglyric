Turbo goes to rocket, put your kiss in my handSinsate your belly downBend down round this garbage canPlow pound down dirty starfield roadHot ham slap it muscle skin jam loadBlam bam I transplode you to the lambJesus is screaming your nameViolent loving yeah, kissing goldenWe're going insaneBut where is the shameWhen the stuck pig is to blame"Ai ye butt cheeks can't be tamedAs I splooey my nameIn flame."
