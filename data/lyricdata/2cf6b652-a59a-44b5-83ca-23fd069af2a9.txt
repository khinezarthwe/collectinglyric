Throw your hands up to the skyAnd scream out loud i'm free'cause wrong is the new rightSo we can cut loose tonightIt costs a lot to look this cheapFire makes it burn and water makes it turnWe must still be here living on earthThey keep telling me jesus walked on waterHe shoulda surfedIn 1918 the great bambinoKicked a piano into willis pondBut johnny damon swung a batGrand slam that was thatAn 86 year curse is goneThrow your hands up to the skyAnd scream i'm not aloneIs it irony or fateDon't become what you hateWe've all got stardust in our bones
