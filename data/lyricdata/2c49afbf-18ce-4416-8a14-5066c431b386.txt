Looking back upon my life and the places that I've beenThe pictures, faces, girls I've loved, I try to remember whenFaded memories on the wall, some names I have forgottenBut each one is a memory I look back on so oftenI looked into the past and I want to make it lastI was there, I was thereI looked into the past and I want to make it lastI was there, I was thereLooking back, what I have done, there's lots more left to liveAt times I feel overwhelmed, I question what I can giveBut I don't let it get me down or cause me too much sorrowThere's no doubt about who I am, I always have tomorrowI looked into the past and I want to make it lastI was there, I was thereI looked into the past and I want to make it lastI was there, I was thereLooking back upon my lifeFaded memories upon the wallLooking now at who I am, who am I?I don't let it get me downLooking back upon my life and the places that I've beenThe pictures, faces, girls I've loved, I try to remember whenBut I don't let it get me down or cause me too much sorrowThere's no doubt about who I am, I always have tomorrowI looked into the past and I want to make it lastI was there, I was thereI looked into the past and I want to make it lastI was there, I was there
