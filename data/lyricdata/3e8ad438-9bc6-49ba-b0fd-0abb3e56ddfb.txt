Highway runInto the midnight sunWheels go 'round and 'roundYou're on my mindRestless heartsSleep alone tonightSendin' all my loveAlong the wireThey say that the roadAin't no place to start a familyRight down the lineIt's been you and meAnd lovin' a music manAin't always what it's s'posed to beOh girl, you stand by meI'm forever yoursFaithfullyCircus lifeUnder the big top worldWe all need the clownsTo make us smileThrough space and timeAlways another showThen everythingWondering where I amLost without youAnd being apart ain't easyOn this love affairTwo strangers learnTo fall in love againI get the joyOf rediscovering youOh girl, you stand by meI'm forever yoursFaithfullyFaithfully, I'm still yoursI'm forever yours, ever yours, faithfully
