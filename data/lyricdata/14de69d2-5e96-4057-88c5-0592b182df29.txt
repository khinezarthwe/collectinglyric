Where do all the lovers meet with one another,In an effort to uncover what has happened to their salad days?The sprite ones on the corner, dream of something warmerA semblance of their old ways, what has happened to our handmade days?Oh no!Way back when, we were the latest aroundWe lined and we painted this townTheir faces are green and they don't know what they've done.We can pull a map out detailing the direct routeYoung ones grow anxious to proclaim their advances to the frayIf you don't wake up and the truth never comes upWe will never have our old way; we will never have a right of wayOh no!Way back when, we were the latest aroundWe lined and we painted this townTheir faces are green and they don't know what they've done.Won't you show us where you heart is?
