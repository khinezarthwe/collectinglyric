Come fly down, like a singing birdSings your name, I am still the sameBlack and white, no you're not to blameHolly sweet...put me down to shameLights in the car in the parkI'm falling on my face I know who we areAnd I ain't looking down for the rest of the nightA bullet in my head ended late last nightJack and coke, please take off your coatsCome and smile, please stay here a whileCome and dance, shuffle with a glanceWhen you're gone, bring in for the dawnShaking in the car with the gun in her handsFalling over love and a sweet romanceAnd I ain't never thought it could come down to thisA bullet in the head, with the sweetest kiss...it's in my headIt's in my headMy head, I'm nowShaking in the car with the gun in her handsFalling over love and a sweet romanceAnd I ain't never thought it could come down to thisA bullet in my head, my head, my headIt's in my headIt's in my headNow, it's in my headIt's in my headNow, it's in my head
