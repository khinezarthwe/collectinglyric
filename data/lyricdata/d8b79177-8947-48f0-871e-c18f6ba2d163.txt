This was a fucking bombFor a few seconds, this place was ArmageddonThere was a firefightYou are the fucking diseaseAnother day, another memoryBut I have fucking failedI turned another lie into the work of a saintSo where is the cure?Hundreds of soulsWith the look of horror on their faceNow I rise from my kneesI will not live in miseryYou won't take meYou won't take meNow it's meNow it's meAll that's left is a bitter taste of a life that was once so promisingRather cut at the wrist than laugh about your mistakesSickness still fills the airAnother life that you wish you could fakeYour eyes will cut through me, but it's a risk, that I must fucking takeI must takeSo where is the cure?Hundreds of soulsWith the look of horror on their faceNow I rise from my kneesI will not live in miseryYou won't take meYou will not destroy meYou cannot destroy meAnd I'll fight you with every ounce of strength I have leftAnd I'll seal it with a bullet and a kissSo look at your fucking horrorHorrorI want to see your faceShow me your true faceI want to see your faceShow me your true faceMy heart belongs to you, so save meMy heart belongs to you, so save me, for the sake to give it awayStill beats (Still beats)Still beats (Still beats)Still beats inside of meMy heart belongs to you, so save meAnd my heart still beatsAnd my heart still beatsMy heart still beats, so save meMy heart still beats
