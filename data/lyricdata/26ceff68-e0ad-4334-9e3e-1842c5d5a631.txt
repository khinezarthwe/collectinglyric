Everybody gather roundAnd listen to my dream, you're boundTo thank me when I'm doneSo here is oneI was there and you were tooBut it wasn't exactly youAnd it wasn't really even meDon't you seeI don't expectFor you to understand completelyEven IDon't ask whyCause it can't be summed up neatlyWord of mouth began to flySo when people promised to pay to publish, IReluctantly agreedCause people needA voice for those without one, I'veTried to keep the dream aliveNow I'm leaving it up to youTo misconstrueAnd oh, have you seenIn the May or may not issueOf some Vague magazineInterpretations like that make you wish youKept shut your mouthAnd your heart cause your subconsciousShould be yoursAnd no one else'sI shall die a thousand deathsOhThe dream is overOhI can't believe itThat the world went on without meNow I'm that much more behindBut I'll be all right, causeWide awake or sound asleepEither way, we're all counting sheepNo, I don't dream for a livingI'm just living the dreamI'm living the dreamI'm living the dream
