The days of oldAnd all the stories from our shoresHave gone awayand won't return for evermore forA brand new craze around that's making all the wavesIt teaches you how not to act and how not to behave nowTell me why should ITurn away my eyesFrom where I resideTo only find that all my time is wastedThey're not ever gonna listenNot until you reactSo perhaps there is science in violenceI don't ever wanna listen to all of that'sOutside of my doorSo am I at the wrong?The walk to home at 'lone at night's an everlasting trialTake the bus but still they constantly remindYes it's nice you're into musicDo I want to hear the songs you like? (No!)Tell me why should ITurn away my eyesFrom where I resideTo only find that all my time is wastedThey're not ever gonna listenNot until you react, so perhaps there is science in violenceI don't ever wanna listen to all of that'sOutside of my door,So am I at the wrong?The world is ours and ours aloneThey're not ever gonna listenNot until you reactSo perhaps there is science in violenceI don't ever wanna listenAnd it's a fact what the body don't hearThe body will feel for sureThe world is ours and ours aloneThe world is ours and ours aloneThe world is ours and ours alone
