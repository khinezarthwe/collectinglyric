You think that something's happeningAnd it's bigger than your lifeBut it's only what you're hearingWill you still rememberWhen the morning light has comeWill the songs be playing over and overTill you do it all over againPlay, play the game tonightCan you tell me if it's wrong or rightIt is worth the time, is it worth the priceDo you see yourself in a white spotlightThen play the game tonightAnd when the curtains openTo the roaring of the crowdYou will feel it all around youThen it finally happensAnd it's all come true for youAnd the songs are playing over and overTill you do it over again
