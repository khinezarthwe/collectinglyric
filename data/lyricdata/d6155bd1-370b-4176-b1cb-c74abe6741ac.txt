I wake up in a waiting roomWith the taste of blood and a clouded viewI notice there is a tear in my jeansThe sleeves of my shirt have been ripped from their seamsMy memory is a little bit blankThe thought of my name doesn't seem to come backAnd I turn and scream "what am I here for?"The nurses yell "you were left at the door!"I'm a stranger; someone left me for deadand I need to decide what to do nextOh, just then I found a note in my pocket, it read:"I don't ever wanna see you again"And I guess that explains why I can't remember the rest of the nightI should have listened to my friendsI should have listened to themwhen they told me you had bad intentionsI remember the string of eventsFrom the dinner receipt when I grabbed your handI know that you went in for a kissAnd I told you "that's not only what this is"You held me at the end of my seatAnd you had that look, the look of defeatYou wished that you could start this overInstead you left me in a comaOh, just then I found a note in my pocket, it read:"I don't ever wanna see you again"And I guess that explains why I can't remember the rest of the nightI should have listened to my friendsI should have listened to themWhen they told me you had bad intentionsI should have listened to my friendsI should have listened to themWhen they told me you had bad intentionsOh, just then I found a note in my pocket, it read:"I don't ever wanna see you again"And I guess that explains why I can't remember the rest of the nightYeah...I should have listened to my friends(and I don't ever wanna see you again)I should have listened to themwhen they told me you had bad intentionsI should have listened to my friends(and I don't ever wanna see you again)(Listen to your friends!)I should have listened to themWhen they told me you had bad intentionsWhen they told me you had bad intentionsWhen they told me you had bad intentions.
