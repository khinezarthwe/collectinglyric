All our times have comeHere, but now they're goneThe seasons don't fear the ReaperNor do the wind, the sun or the rainAnd we can be like they areCome on, baby... Don't fear the ReaperBaby, take my hand... Don't fear the ReaperWe'll be able to fly... Don't fear the ReaperBaby, I'm your man....Valentine is doneHere, but now they're goneRomeo and JulietAre together in eternity...Romeo and Juliet40,000 men and women every day...Like Romeo and Juliet40,000 men and women every day...Redefine happinessAnother 40,000 coming every day...We can be like they areCome on, baby... Don't fear the ReaperBaby, take my hand... Don't fear the ReaperWe'll be able to fly... Don't fear the ReaperBaby, I'm your man....Love of two is oneHere, but now they're goneCame last night of sadnessIt was clear we couldn't go onThe door was opened and the wind appearedThe candles blew and then disappearedThe curtains flew and then he appearedSaying, "Don't be afraid"Come on, baby... And we had no fearAnd we ran to him... Then we started to flyWe looked backward and said goodbyeWe had become like they areWe had taken his handWe had become like they areCome on, baby... Don't fear the Reaper
