Follow the underdogHold on his collar tightThis city loves a scrapOne day it's gonna fightSticks and stones and animal bonesCan't stop me from having a good dayOn a bad dayThere's good days and bad daysMaking a night of itBreaking the barriersDrowning the sorrowsUpset the regularsSticks and stones and animal bonesCan't stop me from getting away withGood days and bad daysThere's good days and bad daysSticks and stones and animal bonesSticks and stones and animal bonesThere's good days and bad daysThere's good days and bad daysIf you had a different attitudeInstead of take and take and takeYou have missed an opportunityAnd that's a really big mistakeIf you had a different attitudeYou'd still have good days and bad days
