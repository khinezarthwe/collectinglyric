By God's GraceI'm the kingJames the 7thObey or death I bringI hunt the Convenanters downThe Wigtownshire martyrs drownSixteen eighty fiveThe Black Year(Chorus:)Killing timeBelieve in me or you must dieKilling timeHang the victims hang them highJames Stewart reignsBlood on his handsHis people torturedBy his own commandsRevolution sweet revengeHunt the tyrant off the throneSixteen eighty eightThe fall of The House of Stewart(Chorus:)Killing timeKill the tyrant he must dieKilling timeHang the victims hang them high
