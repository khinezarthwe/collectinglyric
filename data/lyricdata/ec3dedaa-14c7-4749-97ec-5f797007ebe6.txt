We all know that you can't always get what you want,But if you know exactly what you want,You can always go and tell Chris say,'Hey Chris, will you buy me a grizzly bear, I really want a grizzly bear, we could roll on the ground and I'd let him mess up my hair. Or if not then a puppy dog, yeah I'd like a puppy dog, we could run in the yard and I'd let him run like a dog'.We all know that you can't always do what you feel, but if you know exactly how you feel, you can always come and tell me say,'Hey Kim, I'm kind of feeling like a grizzly bear. Yeah, I feel like a grizzly bear, I wanna roll on the ground and I want to mess up your hair. Cause I'm feeling like a puppy dog, yeah I feel like a puppy dog, I wanna run in the yard and I want to run like a dog'.
