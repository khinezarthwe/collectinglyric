So the lie now is my weaponLike a bush dried, weathered in the sunWith a spark I'll go up in flamesI'd lay my guts out but they're too small to seeIt's kinda cute how I pretend to beEverything but the instrument i am.Peace or happinesSo let it enfold youA birth to life is what I am afterMy first name won't be my last oneLet the light just drip into your eyesSo it's true my words are contrivedI tell lies just to get into your mindI'm as fake as a widow's smileThis mask of glass is what I choose to wearSo I won't ever have the need to bearTo tell the truth to anyone but mePeace or happinessSo let it enfold youA birth to life is what I am afterMy first name won't be my last oneLet the light just drip into your eyesAnd I am dead, your eyes are lightI'm just a bad actor stuck with a shitty scriptAll of my lines are cheap and the cast is weakThere was no music for the first time I got kissedThere was no femme fatale, my mistress wasn't richSo I've been formatted to fit your TV screenThe film went straight to tapeI'll bow out quietlySo quietlyPlease do this now I begDuct tape my arms and legsThrow me into the sea(Please save me, please save me)Please do this now I begDuct tape my arms and legsThrow me into the sea(Please save me, please save me)Now watch the waves eat meSetting my cold heart freeI'll wash ashore in weeks(You can't save me, can't save me)Now watch the waves eat meSetting my cold heart freeI'll wash ashore in weeks(Can't save me)You cant save me now
