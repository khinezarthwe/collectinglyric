There were roman candles and Catherine wheels outsideInside, all was deadly quietCorner cut, medium weight and I arrive lateI caught you spelling baby names with sparklers on your patioAnd you didn't know, that I'd been writing letters to other girlsIn shaky, shaky handwritingWe swooned like 50's housewivesBuzzing like a hiveThe room is spinning faster than a 45And we come aliveWe come aliveWe come aliveWell you were an octopus and I was an orang-utanAnd everybody in there saw the way that we carried onBut everyone who knows me, knows I make up all these storiesWe swooned like 50's housewivesBuzzing like a hiveThe room is spinning faster than a 45And we come aliveWe come aliveWe come aliveWe come aliveWe come aliveWe come alive
