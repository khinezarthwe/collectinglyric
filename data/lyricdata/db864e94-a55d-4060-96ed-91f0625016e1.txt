There is no food I can't eatHere unless I wanna dieAll my enemies are waiting at the doorThey wanna take you or meand turn us into somethingThat we wouldn't recognizeand I don't wanna be a robotWith metal eyes and metal teethThere are rules we obeyHere and they keep us safeBut it all has to changeNow we're under siegeCause if they take you or meAnd turn us into somethingthat we wouldn't recognizeI don't wanna be a robotWith metal eyes and a metal tongueThey wanna take you or me and turn us into somethingThat we wouldn't recognize and I don't wanna be a robotWith metal eyes and metal lips
