Like a tomato in the rainI've got that feeling againLike a grey hound in a raceI've got a rabbit to chaseRoland and meknow what's going downWe got the remedyfor what's going aroundLike a beetle on its backI've got to get back on trackOr a police man on the takeweighted down in a lakeIf the wheel comes off your cartHammer in a nail or twoBefore it falls apartKeep adding more nails and glueYes I do!I know about youShall I come home?Yes I do!I know about youShall I come home?I've got that feeling againI've got that feeling againRoland rat and meknow what's going downWe got our memoriesit all comes back aroundYes I do!I know about youShall I come home?Yes I do!I know about youShall I come home?home...home...home.
