Some things you never get used toEven though you're feeling like another manThere's nothing that he can do for youTo shut me away as you walk throughLovers laughing in their amateur hourHolding hands in the corridors of powerEven though I'm with somebody else right nowHigh fidelityCan you hear me?There's a new kind of dedicationMaybe you'll find it down the tunnelMaybe I got above my stationMaybe you're only changing channelEven though you're nowhere near meAnd I know you kiss him so sincerely nowEven though the signal's indistinctAnd you worry what silly people thinkWho just can't wait to feel so frozen outI bet he thinks that he was chosen out of millionsI suppose he'll never know aboutHigh fidelityCan you hear me?
