Well, I heard you crying loudAll the way across town'Cause you've been searching for that someone and it's me out on the prowlAs you sit around feeling sorry for yourselfWell, don't get lonely nowAnd dry your whining eyesI'm just roaming for the moment, sleazing my backyard, so don't getSo uptight you've been thinking about ditching meNo time to search the world around'Cause you know where I'll be foundWhen I come aroundI heard it all beforeSo don't knock down my doorI'm a loser and a user, so I don't need no accuserTo try and slag me down because I know you're rightSo go do what you likeMake sure you do it wiseYou may find out that your self-doubt means nothing was ever thereYou can't go forcing something if it's just not rightNo time to search the world around'Cause you know where I'll be foundWhen I come aroundWooNo time to search the world around'Cause you know where I'll be foundWhen I come aroundWhen I come aroundWhen I come aroundWhen I come around
