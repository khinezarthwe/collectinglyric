If I gave you pretty enough wordsCould you paint a picture of us that works?An emphasis on function rather than designAren't you tired? Cause I will carry youOn a broken back and blown out kneesI have been where you are for a whileAren't you tired of being weak?Such rage that you could screamAll the stars right out of the skyAnd destroy the prettiest starry nightEvery evening that I dieI am exhumedJust a little less humanAnd a lot more bitter and coldI am exhumedJust a little less humanAnd a lot more bitter and coldI am exhumedJust a little less humanAnd a lot more bitter and coldI am exhumedJust a little less humanAfter all these images of painHave cut right through youI will kiss every scarAnd weep you are not aloneThen I'll show you that placeIn my chest where my heartStill tries to beat, it still tries to beatAren't you tired of being weak?Such rage that you could screamAll stars right out of the skyAnd destroy the prettiest starry nightEvery evening that I dieLive. Love. Burn. Die.Live. Love. Burn. Die.Live. Love. Burn. Die.Live. Love. Burn. Die.
