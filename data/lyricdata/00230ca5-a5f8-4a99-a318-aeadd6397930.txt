Do you know how sad it is to be a man aloneI feel so solitary being in my home without youI don't know what to do andI don't know where you areI can see my life is meant to fall apart some dayJust to be a simple man who sadly goes his way got no girl soI got no world andI got no words that I'll sayHey hey come on make me happy like I've never known beforeSay you have ever known no heart fore me anymoreSomething new, what's that sound around my heartI feel something new,I'm sure your love you've given must be real I know now andI'm sure of how I can be the man I feel,I can be the man I feel
