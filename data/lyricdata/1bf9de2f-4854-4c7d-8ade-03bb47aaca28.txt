Crack of dawnCindy's movin' onTalking Cindy to everyoneUntil she's had her funShe has meWe twist the sun and seaStill she's talking to everyoneCindy's had her funThough I've heard it beforeStill I need you more and moreBut I just can't get awayCindy kills me every dayAnd I tried and I triedBut you looked right through meKnife to my head when she talks so sweetlyKnife in my head when I think of CindyKnife in my head is the taste of Cindy
