Day is endingBirds are wendingBack to the shelter ofEach little nest they loveNightshades fallingLovebirds callingWhat makes the world go round?Nothing but loveWhen Whip-poor-wills callAnd ev'ning is nighI hurry toMy blue heavenI turn to the rightA little white lightWill lead you toMy blue heavenYou'll see a smiling face,A fireplace,A cozy roomA little nestThat's nestled whereThe roses bloomJust Mollie and meAnd baby makes three;We're happy inMy blue heavenDoo doo doo doo dooDa da da da daYou'll see a smiling faceA fireplace,A cozy roomA little nest that's nestled where the roses bloomJust Mollie and meAnd baby makes three;We're happy inMy blue heavenWe're happy in my blue heaven
