If the sun refused to shineI would still be loving youWhen mountains crumble to the seaThere'll still be you and meKind woman, I give you my allKind woman, nothing moreLittle drops of rain, whisper of the painTears of loves lost in the days gone byMy love is strong with you there is no wrongTogether we shall go until we dieInspiration is what you are to meInspiration, look to seeAnd so today, my world it smilesYour hand in mine we walk the milesFor you to me are the only oneHappiness, no longer sadHappiness, I'm gladIf the sun refused to shineI would still be loving youWhen mountains crumble to the seaThere'll still be you and me, and me
