You went awayWhy did youLeave meYou knowI believed youNothing explainedWhere are the answersI know i need youTell meIs your cityPaved with goldIs there hungerDo your peopleGrow oldDo your governmentsHave secretsThat they've soldCHORUSEvery night i waitTake me awayTo yourFloating cityBy my window at nightI see the lightsTo yourFloating cityCome and take me awayI want to playIn yourFloating city yeahFloating city yeahT.v. turns offAny of us thatSay that we'veSeen youTell me are weThe only planetThat can'tConceive youWill we beLike atlantisLong agoSo assuredThat we're advancedWith what we knowThat our spiritNever had timeTo growREPEAT CHORUSIs it weakTo look forSaviors out in spaceLittle earthShe tries so hardTo change our waysSometimes sheMust get sickOf this placeREPEAT CHORUS
