You thought you were leaving, temporary grievingYou backed out on the cocksIf they wanna love you make sure they fuck youYou backed out on the cocksYou think it's the season, temporary treasonYou backed out on the cocksThey wanna hunt you, make sure they love toYou backed out on the cocksEveryone can write this songBut they can't write you and meEveryone can write this songBut they can't write you and meIf the lies they don't fit ya better trade some spit yaYou backed out on the cocksTime is a leaver, thought she was a stealerYou backed out on the cocksEveryone can write this songBut they can't write you and meEveryone can write this songBut they can't write you and me
