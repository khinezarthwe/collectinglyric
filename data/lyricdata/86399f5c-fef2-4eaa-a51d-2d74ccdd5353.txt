Past midnight's holdWhere the world's awaitingI'll wait for you loveBut I close my eyes, as there's pain too in paradiseHey baby say - just what you're thinkingKnow I know it - yeh, feel I'm sinkingKnow I feel it - I know you feel it tooAcross the water, there's a boat thatwill take us awayIt is shining for meAll I need to beBut I can't find the keyThe one to make me believeLate at nightWhen the world is dreamingWay past the starsThat ignore our fate & all twinkle too late to save usso we save ourselvesHey baby say - just what you're thinkingKnow I know it - yeh, feel I'm sinkingKnow I feel it - I know you feel it tooAcross the water, there's a boat thatWill take us awayFar from the madness - out of the sadnessInto sunlight - out of the sinkingYou know I feel itI know you it tooAcross the water, there's a boat that will take us awayAnd there we will stay
