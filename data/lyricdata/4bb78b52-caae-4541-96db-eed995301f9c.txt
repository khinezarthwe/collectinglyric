I see a red door and I want to paint it blackNo colors anymore, I want them to turn blackI see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothesI have to turn my head until my darkness goesI see a line of cars and they're all painted blackWith flowers and my love both never to come backMaybe I'll fade away and not have to face the factsIt's not easy facin' up when your whole world's turnin' blackI look inside myself and see my heart is blackI see a red door and I want to paint it blackI see them turn their heads and quickly look awayI think that maybe it just happens every dayNo more will my green sea go turn a deeper blueI can not foresee this thing happening to youIf I look hard enough into the settin' sunMy love will laugh with me until the mornin' comesI see a red door and I want to paint it blackNo colors anymore, I want them to turn blackI see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothesI have to turn my head until my darkness goesI wanna see it painted, painted, painted blackI wanna see it painted, painted, painted blackI wanna see it painted, painted, painted blackI wanna see it painted, painted, painted blackBlack
