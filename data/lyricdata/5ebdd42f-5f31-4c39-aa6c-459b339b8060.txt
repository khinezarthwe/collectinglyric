Me and You!We're moving gravel off someone else's drive,Into a barrel, it helps us stay alive.Off to marketYou will buy a cone.They'll never notice,They're never home.Policy and bureaus help to move the tide,Pounds filling euros, get yourself a life.He loves you for who you are,and nothing cus the other one is tight.Marry into money, marry twice.Live underneath the staircase, or speak your mind.Well I've got a feeling someome else is readingThe letters I wrote to you.Well, my pet's illiterateAnd I live alone.So, it's someone in betwixed of me and youMe and you,Me and you.Last time we spoke I thought we were through.I found a map,I found a map,I found a map,I found a map.And now that I know the way you can just goBack, back, back, back.There's a bat hibernating on my bathroom wall,No-one went in for weeks, he thought it was a home.Safe to sleep the nights away,Shh, shh, shh.I offered him some food but he said, I cannot stay,I'm disgraced by my actions and I'm at law from the cay.Crying in the taxi won't do you no good.I tried to make a vessel but there was no wood.Strong enough to bend and never swellWe can jump right inAnd buy a pair of gills.But holding on for that long could be the end as well.Me and you,Me and you.Last time we spoke I thought we were through.I found a map,I found a map,I found a map,I found a map.And now I know the way you can just goBack, back, back, back.Me and you,Me and you.Last time we spoke I thought we were through.I found a map,I found a map,I found a map,I found a map.And now I know the way you can just goBack, back, back, back.Back, back, back, back.Help yourself out, shoot history in the mouth,It's all that's left to do.Look me up in some phonebookUnder, Me and You.
