Lie awake in bed at nightAnd think about your lifeDo you want to be different?Try to let go of the truthThe battles of your youth'Cause this is just a gameIt's a beautiful lieIt's a perfect denialSuch a beautiful lie to believe inSo beautiful, beautiful it makes meIt's time to forget about the pastTo wash away what happened lastHide behind an empty faceDon't ask too much, just say'Cause this is just a gameIt's a beautiful lieIt's a perfect denialSuch a beautiful lie to believe inSo beautiful, beautiful it makes me lie!The end of the world!Oh, ohEveryone's looking at meI'm runnin' around in circles, babyA quiet desperation's building higherI've got to remember this is just a gameIt's a beautiful lieIt's a beautiful lieIt's a beautiful lieIt's a beautiful lieIt's a perfect denialSuch a beautiful lie to believe inSo beautiful, beautiful it makes me!
