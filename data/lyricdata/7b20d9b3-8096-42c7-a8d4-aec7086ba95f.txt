It's the sigh of a building falling downIt's the world spinning us aroundIt's the slip of the surgeon's knifeDarker crimes of common existenceIt's a missile sleeping in the groundIt's a camera trying to photograph a soundIt's a case for the basic flawEnding a film in the coming attractionsIt's a sound that's spinning out of controlIt's a light at the edge of a black holeScream of an orchestraTotal collapse of an overreactionIn your blood there is a sad, sad songBleeding through your nervous systemIt's killing you but it's bringing me alongYou were the cancer in my lifeYou were the cancer all the timeYou were the cancerThat's all you'll ever beIt's comfort in a bathtub full of iceIt's the promise of a peaceful afterlifeOr the string of a violin wound too tightIt's gasping for oxygenIt's the signal that's sent out over the airAt the speed of a thousand unheard prayersFaith in the chemicalsA shot in the dark the size of a particleIt's blood from the neon signShine a light away from your insidesMake a map of the balanceWatching life slip through your handsThey're not for shakingThey're not for prayingThey're just for holding closeEverything you love that is fragile in a dreamSee, you're coming downNo one knows whereSee, you're coming downWithout a prayerYou were the cancer in my lifeYou were the cancer all the timeYou were the cancerThat's all you'll ever beYour blood is a sad, sad songBleeding through your nervous systemIt's killing you but it's bringing me alongIt's a sound that's spinning out of controlIt's a light at the edge of a black holeScream of an orchestraTotal collapse of an overreactionYou were the cancer in my lifeYou were the cancer all the timeYou were the cancerThat's all you'll ever beYou were the cancer in my lifeYou were the cancer all the timeYou were the cancerThat's all you'll ever be
