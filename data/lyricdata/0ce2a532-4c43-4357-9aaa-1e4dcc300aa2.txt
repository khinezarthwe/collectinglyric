Breaking out in desperationhe dares to crossThe boundry that separatesthe living from the deadThe Lord asked the man his nameand he answered, "Go Away!"He thought death in it's infinite.Burning in painCHORUS:FEEL THE FIRE, FEEL THE FLAMEOh the hammer falls to your brainFEEL THE FIRE, FEEL THE FLAMEFeel your body going insaneOn your knees from a wicked spellstaring inside the ballLure you to the emptinesshe will take them allHis thoughts found a grip on the worldhe looked up and saw the crimeOutraged of the wickednessthat lives in his mindCHORUSFighting the world all by himselfhe's filled with hateAs days go by he's growingcloser to his fateJust when he can't go onmuch to his surpriseThe wicked curse has gone awayhe reaches his demiseCHORUS
