Just the sound of your voiceDrowning out all my noiseWhen you call my name mysteriouslyAll the source to let me seeLittle bit of feel good goes a long wayI need your touch to get me through my dayWatching you sleeping I prayPlease don't make my feel good go awayJust a look of those eyes, cutting through my smokey skiesAnd the parts of me that grow from youCleared my vision so that I could seeLittle bit of feel good goes a long wayI need your touch to get me through my dayWatching you sleeping I prayPlease don't make my feel good go awayJust the smell of you hair follows me everywhereYour sweet alchemy turned trouble to goldTransforming it all to let me knowA little bit of feel good goes a long wayI need your touch to get me through my dayWatching you sleeping I prayPlease don't make my feel good go awayLittle bit of feel good goes a long wayI need your touch to get me through my dayWatching you sleeping I prayPlease don't make my feel good go awayPlease don't make my feel good go awayPlease don't make my feel good go awayPlease don't make it go away
