Close your eyesCan't you see it's burning slow?Fading downThe sparks of fire earth boundSpace in twoWarm beyond the love belowClose your eyesIt's time for us to goOver our headsLight keeps passing throughOver our headsLight from me to youFalling downWay beneath the healing skiesRise and shineThe crying times left behindOver our headsAll we see is trueOver our headsCan't you see it too?Over our headsLight keeps passing throughOver our headsLight from me to you
