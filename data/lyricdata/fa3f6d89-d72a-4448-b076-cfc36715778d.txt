Watch the stars turn you to nothingNow blush and smile as they whisk you awayPart your lips a bit more, I'll swallow your fear, I will show you howAll the bite marks impress a need to be here, a need to seeCity lights, like rain, dance and explodeFall upon debutantesReeling from nights that kiss and controlAll of our broken heartsVelvet burns wrists while restrainingYou blushed and smiled and said you would stayOne more time steal my breath, I'll feed you the sky, I will show you how.Steal the glamor from death and before you die, oh, you should seeCity lights, like rain, dance and explodeFall upon debutantesReeling from nights that kiss and controlAll of our broken heartsAll our hearts"We all wanna die like movie stars," you said, as you jumped from the height of our cutting room floor, while above us, glowing, exploding, our dreams burst forth in light and death. Hold me, and tell me "We'll burn like stars. We'll burn as we fall. Watch as city lights dance for us."City lights, like rain, dance and explodeFall upon debutantesReeling from nights that kiss and controlAll of our broken hearts
