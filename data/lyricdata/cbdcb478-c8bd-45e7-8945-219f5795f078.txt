You're older, you're haunted, you're ahead of your timeIn corners of acres of blocks of straight linesBlurringly, hourly we cross some great dividesSome heritage moments and some melodious mindsA voice above the engine and the jet stream combined"It's time, sir, the time, sir, do you have the time?"As the moon groomed the airplaneIn a benevolent wayAgain with the myth that's neither here, neither thereAgain with the myth from up, up high in the airAbove it all, I love you all, oh how could this be the end?Satan backhands our nose and our chinThe wings tell the tailfins, "it's freak turbulence"Just then the captain assures us we will land"I'll have you on the ground in twenty five minutes or less""Or less," did he say, "less"? Unless what? We're not on time?Or less he said "or less" jet stream and engine combineUnless he said "or less" as if a joke might just keep us flyingAnd as the moon groomed the airplaneIn a benevolent wayAnd as the moon groomed the airplaneIn a benevolent wayAnd as the moon groomed the airplaneWith its benevolent rays
