I live in America with a pair of Payless shoesThe Upper Peninsula and the television newsAnd I've seen my wife at the K-MartIn strange ideas, we live apartI live in a trailer home with a snowmobile, my carThe window is broken out and the interstate is farAnd I drove all night to find my childIn strange ideas, he's been reviledIn strange ideas, in stranger timesI've no idea what's right sometimesI lost my mind, I lost my lifeI lost my job, I lost my wife
