I see fire in your eyesFeel our bodies burning from the heatMagic runs through our veinsI'm with you now and thrusting in deepAnd then your on your wayyour love will always stayIn four walls wishing you were mineI won't begin to thinkwhen the days start to sinkWill I ever see you in timeAll alone in the nightI'm reaching out for your loveDays are passing byI visualize but that's not enoughWe need to run awaythe chains won't let me strayThe secrecy I can't hold backWhen we're all alonethe whispers turn to moansIn my grasp, I began to attackIt's living insideTemptation of the fleshThere's no escapingTemptation of the fleshA need for passionTemptation of the fleshThe main reactionTemptation of the fleshI remember whenI'd cling to you like second fleshCrawling out in the nightout to fulfill your lusting questAt times I will forgetbut never will regretHow we played between the sheetsAnd when I feel your sweatmy hunger must be fedYou're laying there I'm redy to eatOh you'll never knowhow my love for you reflectsA vision in my mindI need you here so I can injectThe passion's growing strongas one we do belongBonded till eternitymaybe a twist of fateand if it's not too lateWe'll close the door and hide the key(CHORUS)
