I want to go to heaven for the weatherBut hell for the companyI want to go to heaven for the weatherBut hell seems like fun to meThere's something in the sun this day, I feel itOr maybe it's just my hay feverThe weeds are green, the sky is shiningBut it'll soon be night which is nicerBut then cracks peel back and hell bends the roomAnd the devil gestures to youYou've never seen such a BeelzebeeAnd he's telling you to make up your bean about what's left of your eveningAbout whether to flake out or fecking stay outWhat do you make of this doubt?The devil wants to know if you're going down or upEasy - I know what my speech should beI want to go to heaven for the weatherBut hell for the companyI want to go to heaven for the weatherBut hell seems like fun to meThe devil beams a big beaming grinThe sort which leads you up the streets of sinHe holds up paperwork - sign the lineLet's clash with madmen, grime is fineIt sounds all hectic, you're having cold feetThings are getting out of hand, you make an embarrasing retreatLet's ride the valkyrie, commit a bit of sinTurn rock to rubble, punch me in the chinI simply, Lucifer, refuse to wind up on fire with low-life liarsThen you're destined for the world without chores and sweating -The eternal hell of boredom in heavenI want to go to heaven for the weatherBut hell for the companyI want to go to heaven for the weatherBut hell seems like fun to meYou tell the devil in no uncertain termsYou'll never be evil, you'll never be turnedWhat is this evil? And who decides this?When left to devices some humans try shitThis is the reason we should all be tied up?We're just normal people exploring our mindsWe don't go around here putting poison in wineBut we enjoy what we like which is not always rightPeople are intricate, people aren't swineslet's screw the rules up and rely on our mindsSign on the lineYou sign on the lineHe clutches the wine and tips it in cyonideI want to go to heaven for the weatherBut hell for the companyI want to go to heaven for the weatherBut hell seems like fun to meI want to go to heaven for the weatherBut hell for the companyI want to go to heaven for the weatherBut hell seems like fun to meI want to go to heaven for the weatherBut hell for the companyI want to go to heaven for the weatherBut hell seems like fun to me
