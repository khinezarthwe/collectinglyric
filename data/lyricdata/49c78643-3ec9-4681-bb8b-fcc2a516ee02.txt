There's a shield around usIt's invisible & soundlessAnd we drink too much & xxxx too soonSmoke cigarettes in rented roomsWe quit our jobs & shoot the moonAnd cut our wrists & sleep til noonThere's a shield around usWe're invincible & boundlessAnd we're on the run from I don't knowWe're Patty Hearst & Squeaky FrommeAsleep on subways far from homeYou'd think we'd never seen a combSent a letter to Mom & DadMom & Dad the money's running outGot a letter from Mom & DadThey didn't send me anythingThere's a shield around usWe are heady we are groundlessAnd we burn our friends & kill their namesBuild insecure & petty famesAnd tattoo things that we believeStars & skulls & hearts in half-sleevesThere's a shield around usTell me how is it you've found us'cause we hide our tracks & watch the groundOur footfalls they don't make a soundWe've cursed the names of our hometownsWe're compass-less & nowhere boundSent a letter to Mom & DadMom & Dad the money's running outGot a letter from Mom & DadI swear to God they don't get me at all
