You've been holding fire while I'm inside the gunSomeone here's a liar but that stuff's been dealt withI've been biting my lip you've been grinding your teethI've been sucking my tongue you've been breaking off piecesOf yourself and feeding them to meThe ground is being ripped by an army of molesI have been given a tip that they're taking the whole world overBut you hide under cannibal sheets and saying it's eating you upTheir tiny little teeth have never been enough for your tasteWell I was playing drums in a psychedelic band 'till the singer got hip-hopThe bassist was damned to hell the only thing we did that you could understandWas a song about a gun pointing at a man with the head of a mole and beaks instead of eyesSomeone here's a liar but that stuff has been dealt with, oh hoTwelve eyes of evil fixed on you blades chopping your body, boyWhat you gonna do? 'Cause the devils gotta eat when he's up to his tricksOne, two, three, four, five, six, six, sixNobody's dying, no one goes to heavenFive, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, elevenTwelve eyes of evil, twelve eyes of evilTwelve eyes of evil, twelve eyes of evilTwelve eyes of evil fixed on you, blades chopping your body boyWhat you gonna do? 'Cause the devils gotta eat when he's up to his tricksOne, two, three, four, five, six, six, sixNobody's dying, no one goes to heavenFive, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, elevenTwelve eyes of evil, twelve eyes of evilTwelve eyes of evil, twelve eyes of evilSix, six, six, six..
