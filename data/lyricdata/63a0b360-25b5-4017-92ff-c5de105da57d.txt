Welcome back toWhere I'm gonna have youShell shock, fall backAnyone I see throughWatch your head spinLike a mesocycloneBouncing off the wallsNow there's nowhere to runLike a bullet, meant to be shotYou're the target, dead on the spotWhen I focus, I never missIt starts with a kissShe ricochetsAnd you don't noticeShe's in your headAnd you just don't noticeShe ricochetsAnd you don't noticeShe's in your headAnd you just don't noticeLet the sweat fallFind me in the back stallLet it snow downNow we're gonna deck hallsI hit the bullseyeMaking all the boys cryI hit the main lineBreaking through the night skyLike a bullet, meant to be shotYou're the target, dead on the spotWhen I focus, I never missIt starts with a kissShe ricochetsAnd you don't noticeShe's in your headAnd you just don't noticeShe ricochetsAnd you don't noticeShe's in your headAnd you just don't notice
