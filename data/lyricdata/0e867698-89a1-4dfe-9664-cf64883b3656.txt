Don’t bend down in front of meIt’s more than I can takeDon’t brush the hair out of your faceIt’s more than I can takeHere’s to absent friendsWho might never meet againHere’s to you and I and everythingTry your best not to smile at meIt’s more than I can takeOr stand in close proximityIt’s more than I can takeI had my life straightBefore you cameAnd now I fail to sleep through the nightI fail to sleep through the nightI can’t learn anything from everything that’s happeningSo don’t give me things you once heldExpect me still to breatheDon’t go and get your hair cut niceAnd show it off to meHere’s to absent friendsWho will never meet againHere’s to you and I and everythingThey’ll hold a wake in the blasted nightFor the names of you and IWide awake in the middle of the nightFor you and IAnd now I fail to sleep through the nightI fail to sleep through the nightI can’t learn anything from everything that’s happeningIt’s more than I can take.
