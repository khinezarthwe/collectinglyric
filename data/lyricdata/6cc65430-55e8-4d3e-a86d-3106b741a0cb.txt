Cool breeze and autumn leavesSlow motion daylightA lone pair of watchful eyesOversee the livingFeel the presence all aroundA tortured soulA wound unhealingNo regrets or promisesThe past is goneBut you can still be free...If time will set you free...Time now to spread your wingsTo take to flightThe life endeavorAim for the burning sunYou're trapped insideBut you can still be free...If time will set you free...But it's a long long way to goKeep moving way up highYou see the lightIt shines foreverSail through the crimson skiesThe purest lightThe light that sets you free...If time will set you free...Sail through the wind and rain tonightYou're free to fly tonightAnd you can still be free...If time will set you free...And go high like the mountain topsAnd go high like the wind don't stopAnd go highHoooFree to fly tonightFree to fly tonight
