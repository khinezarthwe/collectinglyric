mother woke up last night from a dream that made her scream, and she knows its because she's lost her love for her boy, who's leaving in the morning on the next bus out of town. Father broke down and cried because he's thinking back about his heart attack and broken back he gave himself. His love for his son was strictly verbal, and now he's leaving in the morning on the nest bus out of town. You know he's long gone. He ain't said a word concerning his destination, and he's got enough sense not to come back home.
