Tie a ribbon around your neckAround my finger so i wontNever forget you never forget you never forget you just stay limberBaby wont stop its me who loves you can't live alone alone lone aloneTime will go if you don't slow down its gone its goneWrap your fingers so tight round my neck at last a finger such as yoursLike death in joy it passes me on the street it says helloAnd in a shudder its gone to disappearance ......no!Its gone its gone its gone and its gone away away awayAnd its gone its gone its gone and its gone away away awayYou are waiting down there for meI am here alone againJust just to cradle meFell between your own kneesJust just to cradle meFell between your own knees
