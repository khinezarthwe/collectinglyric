[Thurston]I see a dog star divin' at his magic, snatchin'keeps me up awake go crystal crackingI can't waitI can't stay, a candleGotta change my mind before it burns outI'm the Cocker on the rockWind is whipping through my stupid mopI see a falling snowgirl walking BroadwayTurns the corner at 14th and I know there's no wayIt's alrightIt's alight candleAnd I know she'll be okay by SundayI'm the Cocker on the rockHumming bash starts shiningIn your electric clockIt's safe to say, candleTonight's the day, candleIt's alright now, candleThe wind's away, candleNever thought I'd see a dog star fallingI'm the Cocker on the rockWind is whipping through my stupid mop
