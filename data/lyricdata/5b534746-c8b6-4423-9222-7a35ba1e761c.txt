Come on in, admission's freeI won't refuse those who wanna seeBring your loved ones, those you hold dearBring them all, there's no restrictions hereBut don't look for blame as an easy escapeThere's nothing on show that isn't your shameSo come on in, it's a small price to payAnd I won't refuse those who've lost their way
