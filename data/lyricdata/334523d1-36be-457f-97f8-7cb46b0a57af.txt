As soon as I get my head around youI come around catching sparks off youI get an electric shock from youThis secondhand living just won't doAnd the way I feel tonightI could die and I wouldn't mindAnd there's something going on insideMakes you wanna feel, makes you wanna tryMakes you wanna blow the stars from the skyAnd I can't stand up, I can't cool downI can't get my head off the groundAs soon as I get my head around youI come around catching sparks off youAnd all I ever got from youWas all I ever took from youYeah, the world could die in painAnd I wouldn't feel no shameAnd there's nothing holding me to blameMakes you wanna feel, makes you wanna tryMakes you wanna blow the stars from the skyAnd I'm taking myself to a dirty part of townWhere all my troubles can't be foundI'm taking myself to a dirty part of townWhere all my troubles can't be foundIt makes you wanna feel, makes you wanna tryMakes you wanna blow the stars from the sky
