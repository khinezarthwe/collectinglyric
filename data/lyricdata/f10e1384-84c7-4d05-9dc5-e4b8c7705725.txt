She kisses everyone goodbyeAnd waves her middle finger highThey're never gonna mess with her againThe drama queen is seventeenAnd sleeping with the boys for freeShe's got a reputation of being easyEverytime they put her downShe makes a fist and tears roll downShe packs her bags and plans to run awayShe's saying goodbyeAnd leaving tonightShe's wasted all her lonely tear dropsShe's saying goodbyeAnd leaving tonightShe's used up all her lonely tear drops nowShe thinks about herselfAnd cares about nobody elseBecause the only friends she has all put her downThey hate her when she's beautifulAnd even more when she's a foolThey talk behind her back when it's her birthdayEverytime they put her downShe makes a fist and tears roll downShe packs her bags and plans to run awayAnd everytime she makes a friendThe viscous cycle starts againShe's never, ever, ever looking backShe's saying goodbyeAnd leaving tonightShe's wasted all her lonely tear dropsShe's saying goodbyeAnd leaving tonightShe's used up all her lonely tear drops nowShe's saying goodbyeShe's wasted all her lonely tear dropsShe's saying goodbyeShe's used up all her lonely tear drops nowEverytime they put her downShe makes a fist and tears roll downShe packs her bags and plans to run away from hereAnd everytime she makes a friendThe viscous cycle starts againShe's never, ever, ever looking backShe's saying goodbyeAnd leaving tonightShe's wasted all her lonely tear dropsShe's saying goodbyeAnd leaving tonightShe's used up her lonely tear drops nowShe's wasted all her lonely tear drops now...
