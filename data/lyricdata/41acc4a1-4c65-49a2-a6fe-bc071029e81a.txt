Busted scars cut wide open.Bleeding hearts drip to the floor.Waiting tender touches to heal unseen wounds.The brightest eyes can see right through me.Only her eyes are the remedy.Exit anger through affetion.Exit through my finger tips.Exit anger through addiction.Exiting to your finger tips.Trying hard to reach out and touch what's too far away.Distance will be the death for me.Replacement comes in the form of dreams.
