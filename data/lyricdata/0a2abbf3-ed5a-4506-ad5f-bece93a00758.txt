She used to be an ironhorseTwenty years agoUsed to bring the mail to meThrough the ice and snowI've sat alone and watched herSteaming through the nightNinety tons of thunderLighting up the skyShe was a princess of the nightI saw the writing on the wallShe was a princess of the nightI take a ride across the skySpeeding, sparks like lightningEngine working hardFurnace on the foot plateShining in the nightIron striking metalThe sound of racing steelIt's all I ever wanna hearIt's music to my earsShe was a princess of the nightI saw the writing on the wallShe was a princess of the nightI take a ride across the skyShe was a princess of the nightI saw the writing on the wallShe was a princess of the nightI take a ride across the skyNinety tons of thunderLighting up the skySteaming red hot pistonsSee the wheels flash byHear the whistle blowingStreaking down the trackIf I ever had my wayI'd bring the princess back one dayShe was a princess of the nightI saw the writing on the wallShe was a princess of the nightI take a ride across the sky(sky, sky, sky)
