Oh here you areThere's nothing left to sayYou're not supposed to be that wayDid they push you outDid they throw you awayTouch me now and I don't careWhen you take me I'm not thereAlmost human but I'll never be the sameLong way downI don't think I'll make it on my ownLong way downI don't want to live in here aloneLong way downI don't think I'll make it on my ownI never put you downI never pushed you awayYou're not supposed to be that wayAnd anything you wantThere's nothing I could sayIs there anything to feelIs it pain that makes you realCut me off before it kills meLong way downI don't think I'll make it on my ownLong way downI don't want to live in here aloneLong way downI don't think I'll make it on my ownI never put you downI never pushed you awayTake another piece of meGive my mind a new diseaseAnd the black and white world never fades to grayLong way downI don't think I'll make it on my ownLong way downI don't want to live in here aloneLong way downI don't think I'll make it on my ownOn my ownOn my own
