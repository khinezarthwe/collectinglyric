Does it hurt to rememberDoes it help to forgetDo you know what you startedWhen you lit the fuse of regretThere's not a reason why you've come undoneThere's nothing left to justify, this can't go onThere's nothing left inside as I walk this broken landCause you're living on a paper sunBlind to all the damage doneLiving on a paper sunWaiting for the tide to turnLiving on a paper sunYou can't hide and you can't runAll your dreams have come and goneLiving on a paper sunDo you still hear 'em screamin'And does the fear make you runIs the anger inside of youA gift from father to sonI don't believe in you, you've come undoneI don't believe in what you do, this can't go onI don't believe in you as I walk this broken landCause you're living on a paper sunBlind to all the damage doneLiving on a paper sunWaiting for the tide to turnLiving on a paper sunYou can't hide and you can't runAll your dreams have come and goneLiving on a paper.....You will discover the way to sufferAnd like no other you feed the fireThere's not a reason why you've come undoneThere's nothing left to justify, this can't go onThere's nothing left inside as I walk this broken landCause you're living on a paper sunBlind to all the damage doneLiving on a paper sunWaiting for the tide to turnLiving on a paper sunWaiting for the nightAll your dreams have come and gone
