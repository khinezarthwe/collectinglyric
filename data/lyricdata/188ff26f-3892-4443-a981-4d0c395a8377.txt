Here I stand, helpless and left for deadClose your eyes, so many days gone byEasy to find what's wrong, harder to find what's rightI believe in you, I can show you thatI can see right through all your empty liesI won't stay long in this world so wrongSay goodbye as we dance with the devil tonightDon't you dare look at him in the eyeAs we dance with the devil tonightTrembling, crawling across my skinFeeling your cold dead eyes stealing the life of mineI believe in you, I can show you thatI can see right through all your empty liesI won't last long in this world so wrongSay goodbye as we dance with the devil tonightDon't you dare look at him in the eyeAs we dance with the devil tonightHold on, hold onSay goodbye as we dance with the devil tonightDon't you dare look at him in the eyeAs we dance with the devil tonightHold on, hold on
