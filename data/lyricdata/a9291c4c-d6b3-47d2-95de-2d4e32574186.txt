You are the atom that started lifeYou are the glue of the universeEvery thousand years I've learned to take a breathYou are cosmic and I love youThey brought down the stars and shined them because of youThey painted the sky in blue cause you asked them toAnd all the rewards of life are just simple truthsYou are reasoning for sureI'll never know the secrets of the worldI'll never know them, never know them nowI O U loveI remember when you covered the earth in sleepThe ebb and flow and touch of your kissThere can't be a better wayWith my last breath I will call your nameI'll never know the secrets of the worldI'll never know, I'll never know them nowI O U loveI O U loveI O U loveI O U loveI O U loveI O U loveI O U loveI O U loveI O U loveI O U loveI O U loveI O U loveI O U loveI O U love
