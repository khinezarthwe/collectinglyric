Today is a winding roadThat's taking me to places that I didn't want to goWhoa (whoa, whoa, whoa)Today in the blink of an eyeI'm holding on to something and I do not know whyI triedI tried to read between the linesI tried to look in your eyesI want a simple explanationFor what I'm feeling insideI gotta find a way outMaybe there's a way outYour voice was the soundtrack of my summerDo you know you're unlike any otherYou'll always be my thunder, and I saidYour eyes are the brightest of all the colorsI don't wanna ever love anotherYou'll always be my thunderSo bring on the rainAnd bring on the thunderToday is a winding roadTell me where to start and tell me something I don't knowWhoa (whoa, whoa, whoa)Today I'm on my ownI can't move a muscle and I can't pick up the phoneI don't know (I don't know, I don't know, I don't know)And now I'm itching for the tall grassAnd longing for the breezeI need to step outsideJust to see if I can breatheI gotta find a way outMaybe there's a way outYour voice was the soundtrack of my summerDo you know you're unlike any otherYou'll always be my thunder, and I saidYour eyes are the brightest of all the colorsI don't wanna ever love anotherYou'll always be my thunderSo bring on the rainYeah I'm walking on a tightropeI'm wrapped up in vinesI think we'll make it outBut you just gotta give me timeStrike me down with lightningLet me feel you in my veinsI wanna let you know how much I feel your painToday is a winding roadthat's taking me to places that I didn't want to goWhoaYour voice was the soundtrack of my summerDo you know you're unlike any otherYou'll always be my thunder, and I saidYour eyes are the brightest of all the colorsI don't wanna ever love anotherYou'll always be my thunder, and I saidYour voice was the soundtrack of my summerDo you know you're unlike any otherYou'll always be my thunderSo bring on the rainOh baby bring on the painAnd listen to the thunder
