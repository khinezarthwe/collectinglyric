Here he comes as you prayLike shot lambs you crawlHere he comes as you prayOh, shot lambs now fallHear him breathe as you prayHis tongue licks your palmsFeel him seduces when you prayThere's oralsex in his psalmsAll the seedThat you have plantedUpon trinity fieldsAnd those crops that thriveInside of youGrow like thornsThrough your praying handsHear him scream as you prayThe cold father and sinFeel his soft and sick tongueLick your Christian skinAll the seedThat you have plantedUpon trinity fieldsAnd those crops that thriveInside of youGrow like thornsThrough your praying handsThere's a ruin in the heart of this plainA rose that withers and diesSo leave the fields and join the insectsJoin the lord of liesAll the seedThat you have plantedUpon trinity fieldsAnd those crops that thriveInside of youGrow like thornsThrough your praying hands
