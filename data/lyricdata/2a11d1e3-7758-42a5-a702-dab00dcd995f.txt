I wake up to find myselfAfter all these yearsAnd where all the time has goneStill seems so unclear'Cause there's no one elseSince I found youI know it's been so hardYou should knowIf I die tomorrowAs the minutes fade awayI can't rememberHave I said all I can say?You're my everythingYou make me feel so aliveIf I die tomorrowIt brings out the worst in meWhen you're not aroundI miss the sound of your voiceThe silence seems so loud'Cause there's no one elseSince I found youI know it's been so hardYou should knowIf I die tomorrowAs the minutes fade awayI can't rememberHave I said all I can say?You're my everythingYou make me feel so aliveIf I die tomorrowI spent all my lifeLooking for our innocenceI've got nothing to loseOne thing to proveI won't make the same mistakesNow I knowThat everything will be okWhen I die tomorrowIf I die tomorrowAs the minutes fade awayI can't rememberHave I said all I can say?You're my everythingYou make me feel so aliveYou're my everythingYou make me feel so aliveIf I die tomorrowIf I die tomorrow
