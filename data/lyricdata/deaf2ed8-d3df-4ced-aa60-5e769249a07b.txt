Nothing seems to kill meNo matter how hard I tryNothing is closing my eyesNothing can beat me downFor your pain or delight, noAnd nothing seems to break meNo matter how far I fallNothing can break me at allNot one for giving upThough not invincible, I knowI've given everything I needI'd give you everything I ownI'd give in if it could at least be ours aloneI've given everything I couldTo blow it to hell and goneBurrow down in andBlow up the outsideBlow up the outside worldSomeone tried to tell me somethingNothing will do me in before I do myselfSo save it for your own and the ones you can help, noI've given everything I needI'd give you everything I ownI'd give in if it could at least be ours aloneI've given everything I couldTo blow it to hell and goneBurrow down in andBlow up the outsideBlow up the outsideBlow up the outside worldWant to make it understoodWanting though I never wouldTrying though I know it's wrongBlowing it to hell and goneWishing though I never couldBlow up the outsideBlow up the outsideBlow up the outsideBlow up the outside worldBlow up the outsideBlow up the outside world
