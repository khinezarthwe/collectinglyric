Why can't he give her his love, no more again?Tears on her face and the dove, she cries, she knows...She won't be able to fly away from him,She looks at red roses in springNow she won't be able to singThe song of loveI'll open up my heartI'll be loving you forever and ever,I'll be  part of you in the way I doCome into my life so I can seeAnd then she questions the sunOh Why, Why Me?The Sun doesn't answerOh God, can you help me?The answer is easy my love,You built your own jailYou've always been part of the skySo Why you keep staying by his side, away from me?I'll open up my heartI'll be loving you forever and everI'll be  part of you in the way I doCome into my life so I can seeI'll be loving you forever and everI'll be  part of you in the way I doCome into my life so I can seeShe's a white dove and angel in disguiseShe fell in love with the man...But this man won't give back her loveSo this is her crySo this is her cry...So this is her cry...I'll open up my heartI'll be loving you forever and everI'll be part of you in the way I doCome into my life so I can seeI'll be loving you forever and everI'll be  part of you in the way I doCome into my life so I can seeI'll be loving you forever and everI'll be part of you in the way I doCome into my life so I can see...
