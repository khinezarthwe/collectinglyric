With everything ahead of usWe left everything behindBut nothing that we neededAt least not at this timeAnd now the feeling that I'm feelingWell it's feeling like my life is finally mineWith nothing to go back to we just continue to driveWithout you I was brokenBut I'd rather be broke down with you by my sideWithout you I was brokenBut I'd rather be broke down with you by my sideI didn't know what I was looking forSo I didn't know what I'd findI didn't know what I was missingI guess you've been just a little too kindAnd if I find just what I needI'll put a little peace in my mindMaybe you've been looking tooOr maybe you don't even need to tryWithout you I was brokenBut I'd rather be broke down with you by my sideI said without you I was brokenBut I'd rather be broke down with you by my sideWith everything in the pastFading faster and faster until it was goneFound out I was losing so much more than I knew all alongBecause everything I've been working forWas only worth nickels and dimesBut if I had a minute for every hour that I've wastedI'd be rich in time, I'd be doing fineWithout you I was brokenBut I'd rather be broke down with you by my sideI said without you I was brokenBut I'd rather be broke down with you by my sideI said without you I was brokenBut I'd rather be broke down with you by my sideI said without you I was brokenBut I'd rather be broke down with you by my side
