We packed all our bags and we moved to the shack on the hillLiving like kings we relied on the cheapest of thrillsPlenty of wine and guitars and an old 8 trackNothing to worry about in that holy shackJust a place where we could be ourselves89 freedom street where everything happens and nobody sleeps89 freedom street where nothing else matters and nobody leavesWe played our guitars and we sang and drank and melted the skyThe rest of the world was on hold cause it was our time to shineThe shack was our kingdom and we were the royaltyWe had the time of our lives at 89 freedom streetJust a place where we could be ourselvesA little space where we could free ourselves89 freedom street where everything happens and nobody sleeps89 freedom street where nothing else matters and nobody leavesAnd nobody leavesAnd nobody leaves..Just a place where we could be ourselvesThe only space where we believe ourselves..89 freedom street where everything happens and nobody sleeps89 freedom street where nothing else matters and nobody leaves89 freedom street where everything happens and nobody sleeps89 freedom street where nothing else matters and nobody leaves89 freedom street89 freedom street
