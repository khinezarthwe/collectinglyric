Look in the darknesssee the fire burning brightA shadow flickersan unholy lightWatch the little childrentheir drems brought downRun to hideawayof the shame that they foundCHORUS:On their world is filed with hellOh the childrenSearching for an answer to tellEmotion runs in their bloodOh the childrenStraight to their head the spell begunThey give no thoughtto the way of lifeWalking a pathwith many liesAn evil imageremaining in their mindStonewalling downtill the end of timeOh the past will stalk until...Oh the childrenJudgement has been fulfilledBroken hearts left in the coldOh the childrenBut keep the faith remain boldDon't leave your young oneslike a fawn in a fieldBeware the dangerto be left unhealedNever trust a strangerby believing in a foolProtect your childrenOh the world is cruel(CHORUS)
