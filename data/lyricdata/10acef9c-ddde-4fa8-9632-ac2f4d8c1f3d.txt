The love I hold inside awaitsHeld back beyond these icy gatesAnd he stares into the spaceThis will never fall in place(I could never be)You wanted me to stayInside the world you locked away(The one you've tried to see)But I won't hide from what could beThe future that was made for me(I don't want to be)I held your hand to sayWe had to part this time today(Anyone but me)But now I have no one to holdThis shell I've made has left me coldAnd he stares into the spaceThis will never fall in placeYou wanted me to stayInside the world you locked away(I see this was never meant to be)But I won't hide from what could beThe future that was made for meDeep inside it's coldDeep inside it's oldI need you to agreeThis time it isn't me(I could never be)You wanted me to stayInside the world you locked away(The one you've tried to see)But I won't hide from what could beThe future that was made for me(I don't want to be)I held your hand to sayWe had to part this time today(Anyone but me)But now I have no one to holdThis shell I've made has left me coldAnd he stares into the spaceThis will never fall in place
