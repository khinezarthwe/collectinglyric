Slicing jaws a way of lifeBrought up to waste mankindLoki's pets his little childrenDeadly eyery timeTrapped in swamps by gates of hellDon't ever: let them outFor if you do and they escapeYou'll fight a bloody boutPiranha kill in a pack - you'll runPiranha start to attack - you're doneIf you think you can beat - deadly schoolIf you think you can live - vou're a foolGates of hell are old and crackedThey tumble and they fallOut rush a bloody wall of deathTo kill anything at allTheir sole mission is to killStrip your bones and fleshRip out your eyes tear off your faceAn agonizing deathPiranha kill in a pack - you'll runPiranha start to attack - you're doneIf you think you can beat - deadly schoolIf you think you can live - you're a fool
