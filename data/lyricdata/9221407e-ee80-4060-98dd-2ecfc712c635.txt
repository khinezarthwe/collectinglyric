From the point he gazed from the choice was made, but 'walk the cave or the shore?'The oily cave seemed to breathe on him through gravestone jawsHis little hand grasped in anguish as he weighed up his coinSomewhere a blue-eyed girl in the world is just waiting for a boyFootprints trailed as if trod by slaves up to the grey cave floorBut not one graze from anything ever escaping this fortSo with coin on hand his joy came back when ordered to take the shore'Why on earth', as he wandered the warmth, 'am I obeying this coin?'Turn your life on the flip of this coinTurn upside a choice you'd normally avoidAnd promise me you'll follow what it saysWhatever it saysAgain, walk within the trusted beach or swim the swell of the sea?And again the scarier alternative looked like certain death to heHe'd never learnt to skill of swimming - it never occurred to be very easyAnd again he winced as he flipped the coin and it twirled to his feet'How is this sane?' he blamed the coin now aiming for the wavesAs he hesitated at the swirl of water as it raged and rainedBlue-eyed girls were waiting and he was drowning in the sprayBlue-eyed girls he should have been acquainted with but for shouting and flailingTurn your life on the flip of this coinTurn upside a choice you'd normally avoidAnd promise me you'll follow what it saysWhatever it saysHe finally slugs it back to land feeling chewed-up and foolishEmpties his pockets on the sand spewing a pool eachStaggers back to his dad who's too cool to beSo he says 'why did you have me follow this stupid rule, please?'To be honest little fellow I'll tell youI was just as afraid as youBut you said you wanted to get with people and places ever newAnd I got a bit scared of the fate of my baby son's futureSo I invented a reason to see if you could ever make doAs soon as you appeared behind that rock looking angry at meI soon realised what a hell of a man you've ended up beingI knew you'd worked out how to swim, which I hadn't had in meAnd I stand as a companion of you, proudest a man has ever beenTurn your life on the flip of this coinTurn upside a choice you'd normally avoidAnd promise me you'll follow what it saysWhatever it says
