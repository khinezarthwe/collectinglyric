R'rahh'r!Always known it all my timeA little left of center nowReflect, as I realize that all I need,Is to find the middle pillar path,To sit like the sun by a star in the sky and just beSinners, casting stones at me!I... I stand!  Not crawling!  Not falling down!I... I bleed the Demons that drag me down...I... I stand!  (For nothing!)  Not crawling!(The center,)  Not falling down!  (of calms within the eye!)I... I bleed,  (For no one,)  the Demons,  (but myself!)That pull me down  (For me, and no one else!)Goodbye, sunshine, I've put it out againSaid, I'm over personalities, conflicting!I don't need you or anyone by me,I'll just be living my own lifeI feel like I'm in center, grow, infectingI feel alive, and shovel dirt over limePlant it in myself, to sit like a seed,Under covers of earth and just be!Sinners, pointing fingers at me!I... I stand!  (For nothing!)Not crawling!  (By myself!)  Not falling down!I... I bleed,  (For no one,)  the Demons,  (but myself!)That drag me down...I... I stand!  (For nothing!)  Not crawling!(The center,)  Not falling down!  (of calms within the eye!)I... I bleed,  (For no one,)  the Demons,  (but myself!)That pull me down  (For me, and no one else!)Come play, "Kill."(Refuse my body!  Refuse my shadow!)Stone cold will(Refuse to lead this!  Refuse to follow!)Bitter pills  (Refuse to feed this!)(Refuse to swallow... I feel Godless!)Come play... Come play, "Kill!"Just be... Just be... Just be...Just be!... Just be!...  Just be!...I... I stand!  (For nothing!)Not crawling!  (By myself!)  Not falling down!I... I bleed,  (For no one,)  the Demons,  (but myself!)That drag me down...I... I stand!  (For nothing!)  Not crawling!(The center,)  Not falling down!  (of calms within the eye!)I... I bleed,  (For no one,)  the Demons,  (but myself!)That drag me down  (For me, and no one else!)
