I will come for you at night timeI will raise you from your sleepI will kiss you in four placesAs I go running along your streetI will squeeze the life out of youYou will make me laugh and make me cryWe will never forget itYou will make me call your name and I'll shout it to the blue summer skyWe may never meet againSo shed your skin and lets get startedAnd you will throw your arms around meI dreamed of you at night timeAnd I watched you in your sleepI met you in high placesI touched your head and touched your feetSo if you disappear out of viewYou know, I will never say goodbyeThough I try to forget itYou will make me call your name and I'll shout it to the blue summer skyWe may never meet againSo shed your skin and lets get startedAnd you will throw your arms around meYeah, you will throw your arms around me
