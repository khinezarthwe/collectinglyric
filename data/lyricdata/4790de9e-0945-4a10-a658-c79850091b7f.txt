I can't believe this nowThis isn't what I plannedI lived and died and nowI just can't understandWith all the love I feelI could never leave herNo matter what the costMy soul's the price to see herOh, how I love youThe pain won't go awayOh, when I need youYou're always so far awayI cry for youLeaving myself to blameI died for youI gave up everythingThe pain was just too muchWhen I finally saw herShe's happy and in loveIn love with my best friendWhat makes it hurt so badIs that I love them bothAnd they will never knowFor love, I sold my soulOh, how I love youThe pain won't go awayOh, when I need youYou're always so far awayI cry for youLeaving myself to blameI died for youI gave up everythingOh, how I love youThe pain won't go awayOh, when I need youYou're always so far awayI cry for youLeaving myself to blameI died for youI gave up everything
