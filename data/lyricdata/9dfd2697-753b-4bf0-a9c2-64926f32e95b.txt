I feel it welling up insideAnd Robert Smith lied, boys do cryAnd with blood tears in my eyesI'm an Anne Rice novel come to lifeI can't hide the monster anymoreOne can only feel desolate for so longUntil one starts to change into somethingThe mirror doesn't recognizeI metamorphosizeThe darkness has been biding its timeTo claim its latest victimFresh meat for carnal desiresTo become what I becameI viewed the sun for the last timeWill you still hold meWhen you see what I have done?Will you still kiss me the sameWhen you taste my victim's blood?So crimson and redI feel it flowing from your lipsCrimson and redMy heart is dead and so are youAnd it pulses through, the desire to changeTo deconstruct all of my past failingsBut where to beginBecause when you live in sinIt's hard to look at the saintsWithout them reflecting your jet black aura back on youAnd all I have is hopeMy inner burns not fadingI'll wipe the blood from my chin and get on with my dayAnd all I have is hopeAnd all I need is timeTo bury in pine under six feet of timeThe lies I told me about myselfClaw my way out, pick the splinters from under my fingernailsI won't lose hope, I won't give inJust live and breathe, try not to die againJust live and breathe, try not to die againJust live and breathe, try not to die againMy heart is dead, and so are you!
