He said he does so I believe himHe said he won't, Kyle won't deny his desperate brother, he's asked his motherShe won't believe him.He said we're going so I followed him,He said we're leaving to fulfil this addiction lady,He claims his crazy, should I believe him?We're jumping tubes and chasing papers,Bumped into chancers stealing minutes from me and the midnight ravers,They've done no favours,So I'll believe him.Your wrinkles document the age of your eyes,Her words they bring us even closer to her lies.He's having rants and pulling faces,He's picking fights with different races,But still not me so I'll still believe him.The train has stopped we're at the station,The sweat is pouring but not from me,You see my minds been snoring,I find it boring,I believe him.The lady elder said that the water was fine,But she never thought to mention we were partners in her crime.Please give back the sunCoz it's the only one I've ever learned to knowAnd I promise I'll never returnTo that under-crowded Camden cheap hostelWe've entered in naive Dundee boys,No one is in no one but you boys,We're not charging, no forceful bargainsSo we believed her.The kettle burns with no distinction,The pimp was raging,The lad was pacing in the basin the fears injected into me,Coz I believed him.Intimidation isn't meant for the young, your plan was buggered up and ken we never sang the songs you sung.So please give back the sun,Coz it's the only one I've ever learned to know,And I promise I'll never return,To that under-crowded Camden cheap hostel.I hope you never escape from me now,Because sincerity is sleeved out in this song,I hope your family don't look down on me nowI hope you never think of me wrongBecause the pretty little vibe we had going on it takes a chunk out of me but all the..........You can't dwell up on the OVER-understatement of the AremseeSo please give back the sunCoz it's the only one I've ever learned to knowAnd I promise I'll never returnTo that under-crowded Camden cheap hostelSo please give back the sunCoz it's the only one I've ever learned to knowAnd I promise I'll never returnTo that under-crowded Camden cheap hostelSo please give back the sunCoz it's the only one I've ever learned to knowAnd I promise I'll never returnTo that anti-classic cindered rank hostelAnd it made her conscious to me
