I have a choice between the bat and the beltEach time I hear about the hand you've been dealtSpare me confession, it's confession you sellMaybe I'll fall behind but I don't mind because I'll catch upWant a song that's indelible like ManimalI hope you never see me wind upWill I be happy on the back of the shelfWill you be happy when we're sharing a cellSpare me your questions since you know me so wellSomeday you'll realize that I get shy and I choke upWant a song that's indelible like ManimalI hope you never see me wind upWhat is wrong with this animal, I'm terribleI hope you never see me wind upFarewell my sweet paramaniaFarewell my sweet paramaniaMy only promise is that I'll never tellKeep you at a distance from the things that I feltI'll bite the bullet, take the beating untilI take it all back anyway, what was I supposed to say?Want a song that's indelible like ManimalI hope you never see me wind upWhat is wrong with this animal, I'm terribleI hope you never see me wind up
