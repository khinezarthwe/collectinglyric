Could I ever explainThis feeling of love it just lingers onThe fear in my heart that keeps telling me which way to turnWe'll wander againOur clothes they are wetWe shy from the rainLonging to touch all the places we know we can hideThe width of a room that can hold so much pleasure insideHere am I alone againA quiet town where life gives inHere am I just wonderingNightporters goNightporters slip awayI'll watch for a signAnd if I should ever again cross your mindI'll sit in my room and wait until nightlife beginsI'm catching my breathWe'll both brave the weather againHere am I alone againA quiet town where life gives inHere am I just wonderingNightporters goNightporters slip away
