Here we are in the maelstrom of loveWaiting for the calm to soothe our heartsHere we are and don't know how to stopWaiting for the war to end it allLove is insane and, baby, we are, tooIt's our hearts' little graveAnd the salt in our woundsHere we are right back where we beganWaiting for the sweet love with open armsHere we are just like beforeWaiting for the warmth of that tender storm
