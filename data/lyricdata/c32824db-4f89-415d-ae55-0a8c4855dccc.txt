Contrary to popular belief, you know what yoThis is not a love songIt's a sonnettDamn it feels good to have people up on it butI'm just a fool playing with the masters toolsLearning how to break the rules of this record company poolHallucination - I see with my eyesBut my heart's telling me liesWhy do I fantasize?Why am I telling lies to the people from the stage?Pretending it's all good when inside it's fire and rageCuz I can't understand how a man lives off the life of another manTryin to pimp the universe - that's a jokeI stay rockin the boat down to my last noteIt's murder she wroteAssassination vocabularyI see your termination as heavily necessaryI should have known - they do it for Forbes aloneI do it to break the walls if I fell off then let me know peopleCHORUSIt's funny how life can goFirst you ride high then you might lay lowDon't get high off your own supplySomeone said first before a fall comes prideThis is my message to the worldJust tryin to reach every boy and girlNot tryin to say if it's right or wrongThis is not a love songLyrical optometrists with 20/20 visionAre serving rhymes like my granny used to serve provisionsChaotical amneotical fluidThe rap druid is fluent in the art of onomatopoeiaMetaphysical microscopic topic dropperWhen I was a kid I wanted rollerskates and a bike chopperBut alas, pop, pop never thought to keep me in styleThat's why I'm schizophrenic nowSo god bless the child that has his ownThe harvest we reap is what we sowChrome microphone - shoot itTowards a dome of computer digital clones that mimic philosopher stonesSayin the style's their own when they bite like Mike FurounsvilleThe sounds illRelationship is a mirrorThat you see yourself up in and the picture is clearerThat's why I'm on the scene with a mike like Ernesto GuevaraWhy I may exploit with lights like Geraldo Rivera, they just.CHORUSIt's easy not to care what people sayIt's harder to pretend and tryCuz they can only love you from yesterdayI'm looking at them now they pose highI'm just a man who's walkingThey stand around and keep talkingThey tried to clip my wingsBut wisdom fills so many thingsSay it againI'm just a man who's walkingThey stand around and keep talkingThey tried to clip my wingsBut wisdom fills so many thingsIt's funny how life can goDon't get high off your own supplyThis is my message to the world...
