Sometimes it seems you just don't understand,The way I think and who I am,When I'm told what I'm supposed to be,You think you know what's best for meI want to see you standing next to me,Seems you've got nothing much to say,And when you're dying lying next to me,I'll turn my head and walk away,Sometimes it seems I might be losing touch,Or maybe I just try too much,Now I get told I'm crazy,Nothing you can say will faze me now,I want to see you standing next to me,Seems you've got nothing much to say,And when you're dying lying next to me,I'll turn my head and walk away,I walk alone,My thoughts aren't always carved in stone,My life revolves according to me,And what you say don't mean a fucking thing to me,You'll see I'll make it further on my own,I want to see you standing next to me,Seems you've got nothing much to say,And when you're dying lying next to me,I'll turn my head and walk away,I want to see you standing next to me,Seems you've got nothing much to say,And when you're dying lying next to me,I'll turn my head and walk away
