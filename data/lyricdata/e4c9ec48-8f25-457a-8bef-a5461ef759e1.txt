And we're boredWe're bored to the boneConversationSome things are best left aloneWhy can't I love you in London?Why can't I love you in London?And they're talkin'Just outside my windowIt's just a whisperBut it's you I know, I knowOh no, Oh noWhy can't I love you in London?Why can't I love you in London?And when the morning comesWe won't mention a thingIt was only a cheapSecondhand ringWhy can't I love you in London?Oh-oh-ohAnd we're boredWe're bored to the boneAnd you wear itLike a cheap leather coatOhWe're so pretty and we're so boldWhy can't I love you in London?Why can't I love you in London?Why can't I love you in London?Oh-oh-oh (repeat)
