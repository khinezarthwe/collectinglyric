If you walk away, I'll walk awayFirst tell me which roads you will takeI don't want to risk our paths crossin' somedaySo you walk that way, I'll walk this wayAnd the future hangs over our headsAnd it moves with each current eventUntil it falls all around like a cold steady rainJust stay in when it's lookin' this wayAnd the moon's laying low in the skyForcing everything metal to shineAnd the sidewalk holds diamonds like a jewelry store caseThey argue "Walk this way", "No, walk this way"And Laura's asleep in my bedAs I'm leaving, she wakes up and says"I dreamed you were carried away on the crest of a waveBaby, don't go away, come here"And there's kids playing guns in the streetAnd one's pointing his tree branch at meSo I put my hands up; I say, "Enough is enoughIf you walk away, I'll walk away"(And he shot me dead)I found a liquid cureFor my land locked bluesIt will pass away like a slow paradeIt's leaving but I don't know how soonAnd the world's got me dizzy againYou'd think after 22 years I'd be used to the spinAnd it only feels worse when I stay in one placeSo I'm always pacing around or walking awayAnd I keep drinking the ink from my penAnd I'm balancing history books up on my headBut it all boils down to one quotable phrase"If you love something, give it away"A good woman will pick you apartA box full of suggestions for your possible heartBut you may be offended, and you may be afraidBut don't walk away, don't walk awayWe made love on the living room floorWith the noise in the background from a televised warAnd in that deafening pleasure, I thought I heard someone say"If we walk away, they'll walk away"But greed is a bottomless pitAnd our freedom's a joke; we're just taking a pissAnd the whole world must watch the sad comic displayIf you're still free, start runnin' away('Cause we're comin' for ya!)I've grown tired of holding this poseI feel more like a stranger each time I come homeSo I'm making a deal with the devils of fameSayin' let me walk away, pleaseYou'll be free, child, once you have diedFrom the shackles of language and measurable timeAnd then we can trade places, play musical gravesTill then walk away, walk away, walk away, walk awaySo I'm up at dawn, putting on my shoesI just want to make a clean escapeI'm leaving but I don't know where toI know I'm leaving but I don't know where to
