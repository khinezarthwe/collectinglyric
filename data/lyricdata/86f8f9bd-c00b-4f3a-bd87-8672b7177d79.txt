Many rivers to crossBut I can't seem to find my wayWandering I am lost as I travel alongThe white cliffs of DoverMany rivers to cross and it's only my willThat keeps me aliveI've been licked, washed up for years and,I merely survive because of my pride.And this loneliness won't leave me aloneIt's such a drag to be in on your ownMy woman left and she didn't say whyWell I guess, I gotta try.Many rivers to cross but where to begin,I'm playing for timeThere'll be times when I find myself thinkingOf committing some dreadful crime.I've got many rivers to crossBut I can't seem to find my wayWandering I am lost as I travel alongThe white cliffs of DoverMany rivers to cross and it's only  my willThat keeps me aliveI've been licked, washed up for my years and,I merely survive because of my pride.
