Walking down dusty roadsLooking for horny toadsWith the sun on my backThinking about people pastMemories that never lastWhen you're young and naiveChorusTime ain't nothingWhen you're young at heartAnd your soul still burnsI've seen rainy daysSunshine that never fadesAll through the nightHad a motorcycle at 10Never got into heroinI guess I want to liveMaybe get a house somedayFind a wife raise a familyThat don't mean you have to dieChorus
