This state, I'm inA place I've never beenI'm dyin' to meet you hereCome break this skinI'll let you sink right inAnd show you everythin'See you in HellWe'll gather around the fireAnd I will lead the choirSing farewellSee you in HellDon't break my spellWe'll drown the wishin' wellWe'll find some time to killI'll be right thereThe Buzz inside your headThe horrible electric chairSee you in HellWe'll gather around the fireAnd I will lead the choirSing farewellSee you in Hell
