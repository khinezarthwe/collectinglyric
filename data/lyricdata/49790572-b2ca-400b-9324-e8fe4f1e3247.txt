Where's that space of fear you hide?Have you gone way beyond the centerOut there in spaceI know you need to get evenTell me the one about the hand that holds you downBecause the bruise on your face, it always seems to stay aroundAnd tell me the one about the hand that holds you downBecause you seem to be lost, with no intention to be foundSo how does it feelAnd how does it feelTo be the one whose always in the wayTo be the words that never made the pageBe the one whose alwaysLeft out in the rainTell me again about the spark that met the flameAnd tell me again about the man who went insaneIs there a place within for redemptionIs there a voice inside with a decisionAnd if so when, and if so then, where's the convictionSo how does it feelAnd how does it feelTo be the one whose always in the wayTo be the words that never made the pageBe the one whose alwaysLeft out in the rainBe the one whose alwaysLeft out in the rainBe the one whose alwaysLeft out in the rainI know that you need to get evenAnd I know it's for all the right reasonsAnd I, well, I know that your staring at the edgeAnd I, well, I know that you need to get evenSo how does it feelAnd how does it feelTo be the one whose always in the wayTo be the words that never made the pageBe the one whose alwaysLeft out in the rainBe the one whose alwaysLeft out in the rainBe the one whose alwaysLeft out in the rain
