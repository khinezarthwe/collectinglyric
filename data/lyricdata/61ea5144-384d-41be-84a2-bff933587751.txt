You know you can feel the breeze with patience of a lifetimeDance above the trees to the rhythm in your mindGently touching your skin inside outFloating on the seas, it carries me aroundYou can close your eyes and never be aloneYou can close your eyes and never be aloneYou can close your eyes and never be aloneYou can close your eyes and never be alonePenso em você, sinto um gosto de marNos grãos de areia, e eu a rolarVou rodar o mundo , mas aqui é o meu lugarEu vou rodar o mundo mas aqui é o meu lugarThinking about you, I feel the taste of the seaIn the sand grains, I am rollingGonna go around the world, but here is my placeI'll go around the world, but here is my place)You can close your eyes and never be aloneYou can close your eyes and never be aloneYou can close your eyes and never be aloneYou can close your eyes and never be aloneSince the day I left, from the startI can feel megabytes of memories in my heartWish I disappear and wake up in some other placeWhere there's no pain or fear, is simple like 'Hello'You can close your eyes and never be aloneYou can close your eyes and never be aloneYou can close your eyes and never be aloneYou can close your eyes and never be alone
