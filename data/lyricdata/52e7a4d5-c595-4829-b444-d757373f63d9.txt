Blast id earthOm immersedGold in caveThe blondes come firstI love the way you moveI hope its not too lateFor meIts too goodOn this seaWhere the lightIs greenWhere the lightIs greenJagged brainSlow refrainWe love the jamsAnd black runs freeI love the way you moveI hope its not too lateFor meIts too goodOn this seaWhere the lightIs greenWhere the lightIs green
