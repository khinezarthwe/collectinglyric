I know you're in therePulling stringsI know you're in thereSomewhere deep withinI know you're diggingDigging through my brainParanoid they saidGet out of my head!I know you want itI can feel youDeep insideUnder my skinI know you're starvingFor the passionBut pleasure is deadGet out of my head!GET OUT OF MY HEADI've tried to kill youDrugs, booze, and noiseTried to forget youBut I still hear your voiceThe headache getting worseI wanna poison you with leadBring a .45 you saidGet out of my head
