I sat alone with the dreams of childrenWeeping willows and tall dark building,I've caught a fashion from the dreams of childrenBut woke up sweating from this modern nightmare, andI was alone, no one was thereI caught a glimpse from the dreams of childrenI got a feeling of optimismBut woke up to a grey and lonely pictureThe streets below left me feeling dirty, andI was alone, no one was thereI was alone, no one was thereSomething's gonna crack on your dreams tonight...You will crack on your dreams tonightI fell in love with the dreams of childrenI saw a vision of all the happy daysI've caught a fashion from the dreams of childrenBut woke up sweating from this modern nightmare, andI was alone, no one was thereI was alone, no one was thereSomething's gonna crack on your dreams tonight...You will crack on your dreams tonightYou will choke on your dreams tonight
