When I'm caught in a net and I haven't a clueAll I've got to do is climb the ladder to youClimb the LadderWhen there are ghosts in my coatand everything is askewAll I've got to do is climb the ladder to youClimb the ladder to youAll of these faces are crowding around mewith mouths open wide to devourBut they have no impact no I do not cowerknowing I'm safe in your towerWhen my pencil tips broken and my brain is tooAll I've got to do is climb the ladder to youClimb the ladderWhen I feel like an oar in a sunken canoeAll I've got to do is climb the ladder to youClimb the ladder to youAll of these faces are crowding around melike grey paint caked on a flowerBut they have no impact no value no powerknowing I'm safe in your tower
