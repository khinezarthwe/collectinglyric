The summer sun stood up in the sky& looked back down like it's some kind of eye."I've got nothing to hide," I said out loud,But I feel much better when I'm under a cloud.So I climbed up the hill of all I've destroyed,& looked out into the gaping void.But all I could do was stand & stare,Though just one more step could have taken me there.Oh, someday we'll meet beyond the moon -Someday soon.
