You can hide around the cornerSeek me with your spiesKeep ya head a goin’Keep ya toes on the lively sideOoohoooYou can sleep with one eye openSeek me from afarI hear you got some new clothesI even hear you gotta new carOoohoooWell you can keep on laughing behind my back‘Cause I’m waiting for the moment to strike you backSit around idle and nod my headWell it’s about the patience and getting revenge‘Cause I’m always right behind youAlways right behind youAlways right behind youAlways right behind youAlways right behind youI heard you turned a new leafGotta new set of friends, a new kind of businessYou’ve even got money to spendOoohoooWell it ain’t about the moneyIt’s all about your rotten liesIt’s all about the fact that you’re leaving me high and dryAaahaaaWell you can keep on laughing behind my back‘Cause I’m waiting for the moment to strike you backSit around idle and nod my headWell it’s about the patience and getting revenge‘Cause I’m always right behind youAlways right behind youAlways right behind youAlways right behind youAlways right behind you
