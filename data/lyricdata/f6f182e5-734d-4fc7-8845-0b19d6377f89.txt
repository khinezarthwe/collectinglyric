If your instinct's always rightHow about I step aside?And let you do your thing againAnd if there's nothingThat can fool youHow come you're all alone?Anything can happen nowAnd when you close your little eyesThey will plunder all your dreamsAnd take away your teddy bearI guess you fucked it upI guess you fucked it up this timeMonkey see and monkey doNow what a fool are youTo do just what they told you toAnd now you know how roles can changeYou used to be so out of rangeFrom anything that brought you downNow every time you go to sleepYou get to feel how this runs so deepMakes nightmares out of pretty dreamsI guess you fucked it upI guess you fucked it up this timeI just wish there was somethingThat you could say That could makeMe care again Something that wouldMake me want to get you out of thisBut there is really nothing left ofAnything we had So now you're on your ownSo now you're all aloneNo one to tell you how to thinkNo one to tell you when to stopNo one to tell you when to thinkAbout the fact that you fucked upThat you fucked upAbout the fact that you fucked upThat you fucked upAbout the fact that you fucked upThat you fucked up againThey're in control nowAnd there's nothing you can do
