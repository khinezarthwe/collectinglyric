I've got an angelShe doesn't wear any wingsShe wears a heart that can melt my ownShe wears a smile that can make me wanna singShe gives me presentsWith her presence aloneShe gives me everything I could wish forShe gives me kisses on the lips just for coming homeShe could make angelsI've seen it with my own eyesYou gotta be careful when you've got good loveCause the angels will just keep on multiplyingBut you're so busy changing the worldJust one smile and you can change all of mineWe share the same soulOh oh oh ohhhWe Share the same soulOh oh oh ohhhWe Share the same soulOh oh oh ohhhOh oh oh ohhhUmm umm umm uhhhhhhmm
