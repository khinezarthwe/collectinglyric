What direction should we choose?We're lost and still confusedI walk into the sunWith you, the only oneWho understood the waysThe hours become daysThe weeks turn into monthsWe walk into the sunSo glad to have a guideLess lonely for the rideAnd should this car ascendAt least I'm with a friendIn space all things are slowNo sound with speakers blownThe silence fits the sceneThe prince is now the kingWe walk into the sunWe walk but cannot runBecause walking's half the funWe walk into the sunAnd neon blurs my sightI'm guided by strange lightsAnd I'm rattled and I'm stunnedAs I walk into the sun
