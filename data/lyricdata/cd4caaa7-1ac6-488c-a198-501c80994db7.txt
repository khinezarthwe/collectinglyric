So be it, I'm your crowbarIf that's what I am so farUntil you get out of this messAnd I will pretendThat I don't know of your sinsUntil you are ready to confessBut all the time, all the timeI'll know, I'll knowAnd you can use my skinTo bury secrets inAnd I will settle you downAnd at my own suggestion,I will ask no questionsWhile I do my thing in the backgroundBut all the time, all the timeI'll know, I'll knowBaby-I can't help you out, while she's still aroundSo for the time being, I'm being patientAnd amidst this bitternessIf you'll just consider this-even if it don't make senseAll the time-give it timeAnd when the crowd becomes your burdenAnd you've early closed your curtains,I'll wait by the backstage doorWhile you try to find the lines to speak your mindAnd pry it open, hoping for an encoreAnd if it gets too late, for me to waitFor you to find you love me, and tell me soIt's ok, don't need to say it.
