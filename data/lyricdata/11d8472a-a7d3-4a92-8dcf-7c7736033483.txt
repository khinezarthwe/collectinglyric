Hold on if you canI'm coming to get youTo take you from that manAnd I have always been hopefulThat you'd come aroundAnd since I got your messageI have felt like it was ChristmasWith everybody breathing, everyone I loveIf you were still mineThen we could get you off the drugsSo hang in there for nowWhile I'm covering distanceLike something from the bibleAnd I've always been hopefulThat you would come aroundAnd since I got your blessingI have felt like it was ChristmasWith everybody breathing, everyone I loveIf you were still mineThen we could get you of the drugsSince I got your blessingI have felt like it was ChristmasWith everybody breathing, everyone I loveIf you were still mineThen we could get you of the drugsSince I got your messageI have felt like it was ChristmasWith everybody breathing, everyone I loveIf you were still mineThen we could get you of the drugs
