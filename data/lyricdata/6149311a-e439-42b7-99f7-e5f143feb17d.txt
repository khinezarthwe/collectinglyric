I'm burning out the TV tubes it's three o'clock and I'm confusedCause commitment is so complete it's burning little holes in meI know that I might look a mess and she's so perfect in that Oxfam dressShe looks just like a beauty queen shining out in velveteen I'm deliriousYou make it better you make the weather seem okayYou're my anaesthetic you just take the pain awayI love it when she comes around she's a firework that never endsA microchip inside my brain I'm crawling on my knees againIt scares me the way I am I'm buried in a sea of sandLying on a hand grenade waiting for the world to shake I'm deliriousYou make it better you make the weather seem okayYou're my anaesthetic you just take the pain awayYou make it better better you just take the pain awayDelirious I'm so delirious delirious deliriousYou make it better you make the weather seem okayYou're my anaesthetic you just take the pain awayYou make it better you make the weather seem okayYou're my anaesthetic you just take the pain awayYou make it better you make the weather seem okayYou're my anaesthetic you just take the pain away away awayAnaesthetic she's my anaesthetic anaesthetic she's my anaesthetic
