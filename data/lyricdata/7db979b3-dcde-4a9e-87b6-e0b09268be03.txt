I'm taking all you down with meExplosives duct taped to my spineNothing's gonna change my mindI won't listen to anyone's last wordsThere's nothing left for you to saySoon you'll be dead anywayWell, no one here is getting out aliveThis time I've really lost my mind and I don't careSo close your eyesAnd kiss yourself goodbyeAnd think about the times you spent and what they've meantTo me it's nothingTo me it's nothingTo me it's nothingTo me it's nothingI'm losing all my happinessThe happiness you pinned on meLoneliness still comforts meMy anger dwells inside of meI'm taking it all out on you and all the shit you put me throughWell, no one here is getting out aliveThis time I've really lost my mind and I don't careSo close your eyesAnd kiss yourself goodbyeAnd think about the times you spent and what they've meantTo me it's nothingTo me it's nothingTo me it's nothingTo me it's nothingDo you ever think back to another time?Does it bring you so down that you thought you lost your mind?Do you ever want to lead a long trail of destructionand mow down any bullshit that confronts you?Do you ever build up all the small things in your headTo make one problem that adds up to nothingTo me it's nothingTo me it's nothingTo me it's nothing
