I could feel at the timeThere was no way of knowingFallen leaves in the nightWho can say where they're blowing?As free as the windHopefully learningWhy the sea on the tideHas no way of turningMore than thisYou know there's nothingMore than thisTell me one thingMore than thisOoh, there's nothingIt was fun for a whileThere was no way of knowingLike a dream in the nightWho can say where we're going?No care in the worldMaybe I'm learningWhy the sea on the tideHas no way of turningMore than thisYou know there's nothingMore than thisTell me one thingMore than thisNo, there's nothingMore than thisNothingMore than thisMore than thisNothing
