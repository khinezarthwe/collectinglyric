Sometimes I get up sad when people treat me badI don't have time to think and so I get real madI pull my hair and find somewhere that I can be aloneBut when I do I think of you and then I hurry homeWhere I've got chores to keep me busyA clock to keep my timeA pretty girl to love meWith the same last name as mineAnd when the flowers wiltA big old quilt to keep us warmI've got the sun to see your blue eyesAnd tonight you're in my armsSomtimes I get on wild when fancy cars drive fastMoney don't get me down but I can't make it lastI bite my nails and if that fails I go get myself stonedBut when I do I think of you and head myself back homeWhere I've got chores to keep me busyA clock to keep my timeA pretty girl to love meWith the same last name as mineAnd when the flowers wiltA big old quilt to keep us warmI've got the sun to see your blue eyesAnd tonight you're in my armsSomtimes I get on wild when fancy cars drive fastMoney don't get me down but I can't make it lastI bite my nails and if that fails I go get myself stonedBut when I do I think of you and head myself back homeWhere I've got chores to keep me busyA clock to keep my timeA pretty girl to love meWith the same last name as mineAnd when the flowers wiltA big old quilt to keep us warmI've got the sun to see your blue eyesAnd tonight you're in my arms
