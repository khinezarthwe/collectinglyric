Cold year workin out aloneSnow fall cuts me to the boneFeel you turn me onAnd it's cold like a stoneYoung boy runnin with the herdSmall town hidden from the worldYou don't feel the way I doAnd it's cold like a stoneWhen you're togetherÂ…. you're aloneCold year workin out aloneSmall town cuts me to the boneYou don't feel the way I doAnd it's cold like a stone with youWhen we're together we're alone
