It's a void that I can't fillAn empty space I can't replaceWith anything at allThe lights are all burnt outAnd smoke will drive the swimmers downthere's noone left at allYou've done enoughHe's still aliveHe's breathing on his ownI leave everything I haveYou've done enoughHe's still aliveAnd he's breathing on his ownAnd he's breathing on his ownThere's chaos everywhereAnd panic written on the airThat everyone is breathingAnd crushing light of dayPain will never wash awayFear will never leaveYou've done enoughHe's still aliveHe's breathing on his ownI leave everything I haveYou've done enoughHe's still aliveAnd he's breathing on his ownAnd he's breathing on his ownAnd god save our soulsHow tables have turnedAnd brokeOne more like this could be the endThey say they told us all alongBut we were busy getting laidOne more like this will be the endAnd we've known it all alongWe've known it all along
