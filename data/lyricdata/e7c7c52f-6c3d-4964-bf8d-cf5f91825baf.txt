I waited for the light to cometo change my life, to change my lifeBut I am blind, my faith is goneI'm finding out the good book was wrongAnd I must facethat I won't be savedWe're destined to all die aloneI buried my cross with a roseI won't kneel at your altar now that I knowIt's a table for a magic showI'm getting up from off my kneesthe guilt is gone and I can finally breatheBut there is not a plan for meYou're making my tired ears bleedAnd you can prayBut I won't be savedWe're destined to all die aloneI buried my cross with a roseI won't kneel at your altar now that I knowIt's a table for a magic show
