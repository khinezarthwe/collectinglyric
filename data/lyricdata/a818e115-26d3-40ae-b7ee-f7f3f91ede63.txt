There's a part of me you'll never knowThe only thing I'll never showHopelessly, I'll love you endlesslyHopelessly, I'll give you everythingBut I won't give you upI won't let you downAnd I won't leave you fallingIf the moment ever comesIt's plain to see, it's trying to speakCherished dreams forever asleepHopelessly, I'll love you endlesslyHopelessly, I'll give you everythingBut I won't give you upI won't let you downAnd I won't leave you fallingIf the moment ever comesHopelessly, I'll love you endlesslyHopelessly, I'll give you everythingBut I won't give you upI won't let you downAnd I won't leave you fallingBut the moment never comes
