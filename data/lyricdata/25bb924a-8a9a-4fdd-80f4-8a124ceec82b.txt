If I wish upon a starTake you just the way you areAnd If I do something for youIt's everything I do for youIf you're feeling down and outOh I want to make it rightIf the love you feel is truePlease let me share it with youIf you wish upon a starTake me just the way I amAnd If I do something for youIt's everything I do for youThere is magic in her fingertipsThere is magic in the lips I kissThere is magic in her beautiful eyesJustify the tears I've cried
