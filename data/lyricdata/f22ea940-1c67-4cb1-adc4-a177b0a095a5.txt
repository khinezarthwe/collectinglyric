I dream...and the laws of the world breathe cold, weakening to dieAnd I watch...I watch the codes of life split in two as the open their arms for me and youAnd as they scream as faces of pain betrayed as tears by the rainAnd as they sing, they sing your name.And as they sing as tounges of lies of deceit and of painIt's our God the DrugsThat twists within and is trying to winIt's our God the DrugsIt's a new world code of bliss dressed in skinI live but the storm of my heart bleeds of life and of hungerAnd I'll die...And the doors of perception are naked for darkness to takeAnd as they call as voices of wonder for secrets and truthAnd as they die so trashed and neglected... yet with a saint's sympathyIt's our God the DrugsThat twists within and is trying to winIt's our God the DrugsIt's a new world code of bliss dressed in skinYet we breathe... terror to some, heaven to others.What do angels dream, do angels sleep, do demons dream of darkness deep?It's our God the DrugsThat twists within and is trying to winIt's our God the DrugsIt's a new world code of bliss dressed in skin
