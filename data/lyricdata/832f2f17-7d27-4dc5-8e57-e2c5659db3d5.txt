Sittin' on the beachThe island king of loveDeep in Fijian seasDeep in some blissful dreamWhere the goddess finally sleepsIn the lap of her loverSubdued in all her rageAnd I am aglow with the tasteOf the demons driven outAnd happily replacedWith the presence of real loveThe only one who savesI wanna dance with youI see a world where people live and die with graceThe karmic ocean dried up and leave no traceI wanna dance with youI see a sky full of the stars that change our mindsAnd lead us back to a world we would not faceThe stillness in your eyesConvinces me that II don't know a thingAnd I've been around the worldAnd I've tasted all the winesA half a billion timesCame sickened to your shoresYou show me what this life is forI wanna dance with youI see a world where people live and die with graceThe karmic ocean dried up and leave no traceI wanna dance with youI see a sky full of the stars that change our mindsAnd lead us back to a world we would not faceIn this altered stateFull of so much pain and rageYou know we got to find a way to let it goSittin' on the beachThe island king of loveDeep in Aegean seasDeep in the heart of it allWhere the goddess finally sleepsAfter eons of war and lifetimesShe smilin' and free, nothin' leftBut a cracking voice and a song of loveI wanna dance with youI see a world where people live and die with graceThe karmic ocean dried up and leave no traceI wanna dance with youI see a sky full of the stars that change our mindsAnd lead us back to a world we would not faceWe would not faceWe would not faceWe would not faceWe would not faceWe would not face
