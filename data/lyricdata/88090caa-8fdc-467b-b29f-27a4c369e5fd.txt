Feeding the fall, I can't help but desire of falling down this timeDeep in this hole am I making?I can't escape, falling all this timeWe come to this place, falling through time, living a hollow lifeAlways we're taking, waiting for signsHollow lifeFearing to fall and still the ground below me calls, falling down this timeRipping apart all these things I have tried to stop, falling all this timeWe come to this place, falling through time, living a hollow lifeAlways we're taking, waiting for signsHollow lifeIs there ever any wonder why we look to the sky?Search in vain, asking whyAll alone, where is God looking down?We don't knowWe fall in space, we can't look downDeath may come, peace I have foundWhat to say? Am I alive?Am I asleep? Or have I died?(Haunting me)We fall in space(Haunting me)We can't look downDeath may come, peace I have found(Something takes a part of me)What to say?(Something takes a part of me)Am I alive? Am I asleep?We fall downWe come to this place, falling through time, living a hollow lifeAlways we're taking, waiting for signsHollow lifeIs there ever any wonder why we look to the sky?Search in vain, asking why?All alone, where is God looking down?We don't knowIs there ever any wonder why we look to the sky?Search in vain, asking why?All alone, where is God looking down?We don't knowWe fall in space, we can't look downDeath may come, peace I have found
