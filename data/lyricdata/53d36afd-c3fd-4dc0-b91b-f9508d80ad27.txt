Look after me and I'll look after youThat's something we both forgot to doI find it hard to see your face, day to day todayCannot remember it well enough, or in detail such that I see it in my headWhen I am with you it's familiar and beautiful and I know it as if laughingAs light comes in I know it better then see it less clear againAs if I'm squinting I see you are so far from meAs if by miracle I see your room, I see us threeBut words and music, these images, they come back to meCrystal clear in my head, but it's behind a screenEvery time I see your face I break down and cryI see it in your family as they walk on byCome back to me and I'll come back to youThat's something we both will always do
