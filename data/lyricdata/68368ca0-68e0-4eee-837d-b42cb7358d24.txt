Thinking of the words to say,I'd like to think that this was fate.Reference to a song you love,Spell confusion with a KLike a star without its strings,I'm hanging here on these two wings.For that smile and those eyesI'm fallingIf time could stop, how could I make this more poetic?When there's nothing more pathetic to be saidYou bring me out, show me light,I'm sorry if I hide, I'm too afraid to look inside.You carry through, you make me smile.If it were you and me tonight,I would tame the stars and save the brightest one for you,For you...If you ever had the chance,Would you make your life seem right?Or would you only hold it back,The good times, the hard, and the bad.Whatever you say is alright,Just as long as there's no doubt.Could you look me in the eyesAnd say hopes diedIf time could stop, how could I make this more poetic?When there's nothing more pathetic to be saidYou bring me out, show me light,I'm sorry if I hide, I'm too afraid to look inside.You carry through, you make me smile.If it were you and me tonight,I would tame the stars and save the brightest one for you.Our wish,Each time,Keeps me returning to you,Night after nightLift me up as high as the clouds that warm the sky,For you and IYou bring me out, show me light,I'm sorry if I hide, I'm too afraid to look inside.You carry through, you make me smile,If it were you and me tonight,I would tame the stars and save the brightest one for youYou bring me out, show me light,I'm sorry if I hide, I'm too afraid to look insideYou carry through, you make me smileIf it were you and me tonight,I would tame the stars and save the brightest one for you,For you...
