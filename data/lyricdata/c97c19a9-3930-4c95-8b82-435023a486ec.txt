God knows I love youMeaning I love you as much as I canHow could you trust meI should've saidI'm not the right kind of manDon't wanna tell more liesDon't wanna blind your eyesWe can't go on, our time has goneOh can't you see, oh can't you seeThere is no returnOh baby, no returnGod knows it hurts meTo see how this betrayal of mine hurts youI thought that this timeI wouldn't let you down but now I doDon't wanna tell more liesDon't wanna blind your eyesNow it must be clearYou weren't even nearTo my heart, lies from the startThere's no returnOh baby, no returnYou must bury your love deepDon't let the painful cracksOf broken heart showBut never turn coldTomorrow stays there alwaysSo you'll never knowI won't tell more liesI won't blind your eyesBut someone may and that's the wayOf no returnOh baby, no return
