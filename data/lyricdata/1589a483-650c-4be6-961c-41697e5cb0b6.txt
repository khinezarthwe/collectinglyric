No one told me the way I should feelYou left an aching heartLost and lonely, the feeling goes onYou were the one friend I hadYou gave me so much loveNow the tears remind me you're goneIt still haunts me there's a silenceWhere you used to beIt still haunts meJust an empty space in historyIt still haunts meBut life must go on, on and onIt's still haunting meIt's still haunting meHaunting meHaunting me
