And even though the moment passed me byI still can't turn away'Cause all the dreams you never thought you'd loseGot tossed along the wayAnd letters that you never meant to sendGet lost or thrown awayAnd now we're grown up orphansThat never knew their namesWe don't belong to no oneThat's a shameBut if you could hide beside meMaybe for a whileAnd I won't tell no one your nameAnd I won't tell 'em your nameAnd scars are souvenirs you never loseThe past is never farDid you lose yourself somewhere out there?Did you get to be a star?And don't it make you sad to know that lifeIs more than who we areWe grew up way too fastAnd now there's nothing to believeReruns all become our historyA tired song keeps playing on a tired radioAnd I won't tell no one your nameAnd I won't tell 'em your nameI won't tell 'em your nameMmm, mmmI won't tell 'em your nameOwMmmmmmI think about you all the timeBut I don't need the sameIt's lonely where you are; come back downAnd I won't tell 'em your name
