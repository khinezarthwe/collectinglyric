I am a fallen zerøBelow the glaciers of the evilI am a golden superheroAbove the sun and all the peopleSpace in your face I'm gonna drinkThe fucking ocean, 'cause I ain't from a coast, I'm just coastin'Said I was an afterthought you'd bring along,Well who you after now, bitch? Run, motherfucker, runAnd if you think I'm space-cakeningI've been in shit of rude awakeningAnd I'm floating high (but I'm always down)Skip or trip to face the space or fake in thisIn the middle I stay in place, skip or trip at zerøspaceAnd I'm floating high (but I'm always down)Skip or trip to face the space or fake in thisI met a fellow zerøHe took me to the silver peopleI said, "I think you are my hero"We were one, it all was clearerSpace in your face, it's the way to get you closerWhile you were sittin' on your assI drank the fucking oceanZerøspace, the way to get your kicksBut too many chefs in the kitchen could spoil the mixI am a means until the endI move a mountain with my handAnd I'm floating high (but I'm always down)Skip or trip to face the space or fake in thisIn the middle I stay in place, skip or trip at zerøspaceAnd I'm floating high (but I'm always down)Skip or trip to face the space or fake in thisAnd I'm high (but I'm always down)Skip or trip to face the space or fake in this
