Intro solo: SkowronSolo: LykinsSometime at an early age a strange call beckoned youIt urged you on to selfishness and told you what to doIt taught you thr word trust was just a tool that you could useTo manipulate your target make them do what you would chooseAnd still the call kept haunting you as you raced toward the endYou went through life with blinders on, no chance to make a friendThe call that you had answered is the one that's known as greedIt's tempting lure of empty wealth is one few fail to heedChorus:Too late to change. Too late to change.Just like a lemming you're blind to your fateYou fail to question until it's too lateToo late to change. Too late to change.Driven by something you don't understandYour lack of comassion is killing our landIt made you poison once clear rivers, raze forests to the groundSo you cut your expenses at the expense of those aroundYou did not care your every touch brought sickness to the landThe only green you care bout is the kind that you can spendSomehow after all this time you make it to the endAnd stare into that darkest void that longs to be your friendBut something deep inside of you resists the need to quitYou realize that only emptiness resides within the pitRepeat chorusSolo: SkowronSolo: LykinsYou realize the harm you've done and what could yet come trueThe crimes that you've committed and what you still can doThe goals you once held dearly now seem very strangeYour new found care for mankind shows it's not too late to change
