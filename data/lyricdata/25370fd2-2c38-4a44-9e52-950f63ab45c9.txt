Trapped in my mind, the answers you won't findDeep despair, what I feel, lost in time, what I'm feelingEmotions lost all meaning, can not help what I'm feelingTortured by pain, this agony is so insaneChorus:Diminishing away, day by dayA life once fulfilling now stripped awayIt it's certain I must dieI deserve the right to dieThousands of dollars everydayTo keep me suffering in a life of painI lie rotting be disease, eats away piece by piceJust leave me beLiving through this Hell, life unravels, just as wellPolitics of man won't let me die, they just prolong my demiseA life I did not choose, but it is certain I will loseA disgrace to myself it I take my family through this hellRepeat chorusSolo: LykinsRepeat first verseRepeat chorus
