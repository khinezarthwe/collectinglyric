Is this the way I want them seeing me?Please, leave your memories at the door.Why has the world gone off and deserted me?There's just no room inside these walls.You want it all, but did you want it tonight?Oh, you don't remember as you wait by the lightOh, can you see what you've been asking of me?With the turn of this knife now, I will take your life.This ain't a crime no, I'm calling for mercyNow it's time, please pray for meThere will be justice in murder.There will be justice in murder.Now you've been for me, what no other could beWill I now grow old to forget all those?Blow off sorrow, goodbye tomorrow.There is no worse than the curse they've given meThis mule's seen its end in love and warI'll wish you the best when I'm lost to eternityNow do what you will, so it hurts no more.
