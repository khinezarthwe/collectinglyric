There's a flame, flame in my heartAnd there's no rain, can put it outAnd there's a flame, it's burning in my heartAnd there's no rain, ooh can put it outSo just hold me, hold me, hold meTake away the pain, inside my soulAnd I'm afraid, so all aloneTake away the pain, that's burning in my soulCause I'm afraid that I'll be all aloneSo just hold me, hold me, hold meHold on to my heart, to my heart, to meHold on to my heart, to my heart, to meAnd oh no, don't let me go cause all I amYou hold in your hands, and hold meAnd I'll make it through the nightAnd I'll be alright, hold on, hold on to my heart
