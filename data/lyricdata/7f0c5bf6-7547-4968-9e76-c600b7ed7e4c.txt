Dark in the city, night is a wireSteam in the subway, earth is a fireWoman, you want me, give me a signAnd catch my breathing even closer behindIn touch with the groundI'm on the hunt, I'm after youSmell like I sound, I'm lost in a crowdAnd I'm hungry like the wolfStraddle the line in discord and rhymeI'm on the hunt, I'm after youMouth is alive with juices like wineAnd I'm hungry like the wolfStalked in the forest, too close to hideI'll be upon you by the moonlight sideHigher blood drumming on your skin, it's so tightYou feel my heat, I'm just a moment behindIn touch with the groundI'm on the hunt, I'm after youScent and a sound, I'm lost and I'm foundAnd I'm hungry like the wolfStrut on a line, it's discord and rhymeI howl and I whine, I'm after youMouth is alive, all running insideAnd I'm hungry like the wolfBurning the ground, I break from the crowdI'm on the hunt, I'm after youI smell like I sound, I'm lost and I'm foundAnd I'm hungry like the wolfStrut on a line, it's discord and rhymeI'm on the hunt, I'm after youMouth is alive with juices like wineAnd I'm hungry like the wolfBurning the ground, I break from the crowdI'm on the hunt, I'm after youScent and a sound, I'm lost and I'm foundAnd I'm hungry like the wolfStrut on a line, it's discord and rhymeI howl and I whine, I'm after youMouth is alive, all running inside
