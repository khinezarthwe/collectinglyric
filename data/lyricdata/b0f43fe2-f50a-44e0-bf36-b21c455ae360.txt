Our time is ending, I feel it's only just begunAnd I'm frustrated, I can't believe you're not the oneMy ears are bleeding, her voice resides inside my headAnd now I'm choking, release this noose around my neck!Will I just fall to pieces?Or am I all right?To iron out my creases, you must lacerate me 'til they're goneThese are my final words to youI know you're listening, can you hear meThe time has come to say goodbyeThese are my final words, to youThe clock is ticking, my heart is bursting through my chest,And now I'm crying, the tears are pouring off my face,The chair is creaking, her voice resides inside my head,And now it's over, you put this noose around my neckWill I just fall to pieces?Or am I all right?To iron out my creases, you must lacerate me 'til they're goneThese are my final words to youI know you're listening, can you hear meThe time has come to say goodbyeThese are my final words, to youHeaven, where is my angel?I need her now, holding meHeaven, where is my angel?I need her now, holding me tonightNow!Will I just fall to pieces?Or am I all right?To iron out my creases, you must lacerate me 'til they're goneThese are my final words to youI know you're listening, can you hear meThe time has come to say goodbyeThese are my final words, to you
