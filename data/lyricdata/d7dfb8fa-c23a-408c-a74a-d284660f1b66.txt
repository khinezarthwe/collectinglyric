Meet me in my lust lairI'm a slave at your requestYour dress, my dress I will tearYou know you're with the bestTie me down, I'm helplessBlindfolded and gaggedForce the blade against my throatLick the blood against the edgeI'll gladly lick you down thereScratch wells upon your backI burn you with black candlesClaw as I attackI'm broken - possessedEmpowered - undressedI worship youI thrust your dripping heavenCry out while I performPlunge in through the back sideAs you quiver and squirmRide me and i'll help youGet rid of your despairStrangle me, I want toBreathe you in to resurrect
