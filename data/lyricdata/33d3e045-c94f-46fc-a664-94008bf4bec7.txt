It's the memories that bring me down, down, downAll the sad reminders left of youOld photographsUs laughing, I can see you smilingYou had to kill meLike I have to kill you nowLike I have to kill you nowLike I have to kill you nowIt's hard to lose the sweetest childIt's the nightmares that still returnI was always terrified of love, love, loveAnd I would faintAt the very first sign of passionI have to kill youSorry it has to be this waySorry it has to be this waySorry it has to be this wayIt's hard to lose the sweetest child
