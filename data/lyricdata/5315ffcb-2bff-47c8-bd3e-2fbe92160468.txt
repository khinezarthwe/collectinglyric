I know that I have to sleep at nightAnd we all need someone to blameNo one ever has to realizeThat we all get tired againI think I've been cast in the wrong playMy lines were written on the day beforeI can see there's nothing out thereThat I don't know, but I don't knowIt can be such empty logicThat I don't knowI don't knowIn the time it takes to understandIs a pause where we like to complainNoone is required to take a standAnd we all get time to explainI think I left something behindThe lime green plastic olive branch beforeI can see there's nothing out thereThat I don't know, but I don't knowIt can be such empty logicThat I don't knowI don't knowAll at once it's a special favourWave a hand and it's all arranged for youThough we know you're no bleeding saviourWe listen close it's true
