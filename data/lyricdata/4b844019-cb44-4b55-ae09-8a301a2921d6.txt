Saturday night and my head is spinningI wonder whose heart I've been sinning forA cold rain blows on my windowsA soft scent gone from my pillowOne more step that I been takin'Yes and one more heartI don't need no more breakin' ofThe red lights how they allBurnin' down the highwayI remember when the wind had blown my wayThe wind blew down my lineThe wind blew down my lineThe man on the streetEach day I'm passin'A small bite to eatIs all he's been askin' forCold stares is all he's been yieldingNow I know that empty feelingThe wind blew down my lineThe wind blew down my line
