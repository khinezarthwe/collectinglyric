Goodbye my friend it's hard to dieWhen all the birds are singing in the skyAnd all the birds are everywherePretty girls are everywhereThink of me and I'll be thereGoodbye, Papa, please pray for me.I was the black sheep of the family.And I don't know how this worksI had bought thee turds,With my B-B gun I would kill birdsWe had joy. We had fun.We had seasons in the sun,But the hills that we climbWere just seasons out of time.All our lives, we had fun.We had seasons in the sun,But the stars that we reachedWere just starfish on the beachGoodbye Michelle my little one(The following two lines were murmured during the box-set video, and were visibly forgotten, as evidenced by Kurt's chuckle.)You gave me love and helped me find the sunAnd every time that I was downAll my tears are saltyI think now I was start to weepWe had joy. We had fun.We had seasons in the sun,But the hills that we climbWere just seasons out of time.We had joy. We had fun.We had seasons in the sun,But the stars that we reachedWere just starfish on the beachWe had joy. We had fun.We had seasons in the sun,But the hills that we climbWere just seasons out of time.We had joy. We had fun.We had seasons in the sun,But the stars that we reachedWere just starfish on the beach
