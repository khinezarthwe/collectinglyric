Your imagination's having puppiesIt could be a video for new recruitsJust stare into the cameraAnd pretend that you've got the fluOr dreams of impossible vacationsAnd get all teary from the windLook as though you're standing at the stationLong after the train came inAnd see how the space tautensLike there's something onAnd you're never more hot thenWhen you've got something onPicture a century of waterBury the pipeline guy right hereKill the dream of possible vacationsWith the sweep of a mapping pioneerOutside there's hectic actionThe ice is covering the treesAnd one of them is interconnectingWith my Chevrolet CapriceBlack out to phantom powerAnd like there's nothing onAnd hammering the towerAnd now there's nothing onWe'll ride the monorailRocking gently home on the trailYou want to show me the moonI know you're standing at the stationI know there's nothing onI know that alienationI know the train's long goneI can see how your face tautensLike you've got something onIt makes me feel just rottenBut you've got something on
