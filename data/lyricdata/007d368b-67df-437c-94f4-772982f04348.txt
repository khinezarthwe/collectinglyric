It's time for the crying to stopCause I love youIt's time for you to grow upI want youAnd I need youThere's a hole in your soulWhere your heart used to beAll the doors are lockedAnd you can't find the keyThere's fish in the skyAnd there's birds in the seaCause you want meAnd you need meYou're drowning from all of the tears in the skyIt's a bad dreamYou can't even close your eyesIt's a bad dreamA bad dreamIt's time for the burn in the skyCause I'm hungryIt's time for you to let it dieYou're lonelyAll aloneTigers in their tanks struggle to get freeSkinny little dogs barking up the wrong treeSnakes in the grass learn their ABCsAnd you need meAnd you want meYou're drowning from all of the tears in the skyIt's a bad dreamYou can't even close your eyesIt's a bad dreamA bad dreamScreaming from a voice insideRunning but you cannot findA placeTo hideFrom the bad dreamThere's a hole in your soulWhere your heart used to beAll the doors are lockedAnd you can't find the keyThere's fish in the skyAnd there's birds in the seaAnd you hate meBut you need meYou're drowning from all of the tears in the skyIt's a bad dreamYou can't even close your eyesIt's a bad dreamA bad dreamScreaming from the voice insideTrying to find a placeInsideTo hideFrom the bad dreamThe bad, badBad, badBad, badDream
