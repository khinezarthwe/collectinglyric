Go! Go!Mommy and Daddy's got the best cocaineRitalin's never gonna feel the sameTwenty-four hours on an empty brainI got my finger on the trigger and you're in my wayI'm bouncing off the walls again, woah ohAnd I'm looking like a fool again, woah ohI threw away my reputationOne more song for the radio nationI'm bouncing off the walls again, woah ohAnd I'm looking like a fool again, woah ohI'm bouncing off the walls again, woah ohAnd I'm looking like a fool againI'm bouncing off the walls again
