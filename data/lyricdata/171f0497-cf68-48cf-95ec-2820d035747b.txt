When you came aroundand offered nothing new,nothing old,nothing I could use.I wondered when did yougive up on the waywe spent our spring daysconstantly talkingfinding our voices amazing.You called me over,though I drive you crazy.My eye's still as strong as the avocado, baby.Though my hands start shaking in the second I awaken;I am soft, and still, and lazyand my tongue is on the runand it's only just begun...Did you ever see a good joke turn so sour?My tongue is on the runand it's having so much fun...I'm growing younger by the hour.I should wait until the spring,wait until the spring,but my carpet is crawling with crocodilesand a dozen porcupines point their needles in my thumb.Now, tippy Tina tippy-toes into the picturewith a rolling thumb and finger...Tippy Tina tippy-toes into the picturewith a rolling thumb and finger figure...You called me over,though I drive you crazy.My eye's still as strong as the avocado, baby.Though my hands start shaking in the second I awaken;I am soft, and still, and lazyand my tongue is on the runand it's only just begun...Did you ever see a good joke turn so sour?my tongue is on the runand it's having so much fun...I'm growing younger by the hour.
