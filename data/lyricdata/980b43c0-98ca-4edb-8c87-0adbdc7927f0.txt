Out in the garden there's half of a heavenWe're only bluffingWe're not ones for busting through wallsBut they've told usUnless we can prove that we're doing itWe can't have it allHe's gonna wangle a way to get out of itShe's an excuseAnd a witness who'll talk when he's called,But they've told usUnless we can prove that we're doing itWe can't have it allWe can't have it all[spoken]Suddenly my feet are feet of mudIt all goes slow-moI don't know why I'm cryingAm I suspended in gaffa?Not till I'm ready for youNot till I'm ready for youCan I have it allI try to get nearerBut as it gets clearerThere's something appears in the wayIt's a plank in me eyeWith a camel who's trying to get through itAm I doing it?Can I have it all now?I pull out the plankAnd say thank you for yanking me backTo the fact that there's always something to distractBut sometimes it's hardTo know if I'm doing it rightCan I have it all now?Can I have it all now?Can I have it all?I can't have it all[spoken:]Suddenly my feet are feet of mudIt all goes slow-moI don't know why I'm cryingAm I suspended in gaffa?Not till I'm ready for youNot till I'm ready for youCan I have it allI won't open boxes that I am told not toI'm not a PandoraI'm much more like the girl in the mirror,Between you and meShe don't stand a chance of getting anywhere at allNot anywhere at allNo, not a thingShe can't have it all[spoken:]Suddenly my feet are feet of mudIt all goes slow-moI don't know why I'm cryingAm I suspended in gaffa?Not till I'm ready for youNot till I'm ready for youSuddenly my feet are feet of mudIt all goes slow-moI don't know why I'm cryingAm I suspended in gaffa?Not till I'm ready for youNot till I'm ready for youCan I have it all now?
