Woke up one morning half asleepWith all my blankets in a heapAnd yellow roses scattered all around meThe time was still approachingFor I couldn't stand it any moreSome marigolds upon my eiderdownI'm just sitting, watching flowers in the rainFeel the power of the rainMaking the garden growI'm just sitting, watching flowers in the rainFeel the power of the rainKeeping me coolSo I lay upon my sideWith all the windows open wideCouldn't pressurize my head from speakingHoping not to make a soundI pushed my bed into the groundIn time to catch the sight that I was seekingI'm just sitting, watching flowers in the rainFeel the power of the rainMaking the garden growI'm just sitting, watching flowers in the rainFeel the power of the rainKeeping me coolIf this perfect pleasure has to beThen this is how it has to beIf my pillow's getting wet, I don't see that it matters much to meI heard the flowers in the breezeMake conversation with the treesRelieved to leave reality behind meWith my commitments in a messMy sleep has gone away to restIn a world of fantasy you'll find meI'm just sitting, watching flowers in the rainFeel the power of the rainMaking the garden growI'm just sitting, watching flowers in the rainFeel the power of the rainKeeping me cool
