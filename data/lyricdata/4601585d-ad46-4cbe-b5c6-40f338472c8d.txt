Now I rush to the finger of lightI guess I tore my head offI hope there's something waiting for meTo make my exit pay-offTaste and smell and touchHave faded from pollutionAs a last resort I chose the stupidest solutionThe first thing I did when I got in gateWas crank up the left-hand dialI got there firstThe track star seemed to take a whileNow I can dance like NureyevWith these wings on my bodySt. Peter complains that it's too loud down in the lobbyAnd I hear the voice of GodHe's brillant on the microphoneAnd the radio in heavenCan make a heathen feel at homeAll these notes flying out play havoc with my heartEvery word sung is both emotional & smartThere's a gorgeous sunsetHappening on the airwavesI really want you to hear this song one daySo you behaveAnd I hear the voice of GodHe's brillant on the microphoneAnd the radio in heavenCan make a heathen feel at homeAt home
