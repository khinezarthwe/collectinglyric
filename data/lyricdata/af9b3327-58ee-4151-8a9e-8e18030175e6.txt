One thing, I don't know whyIt doesn't even matter how hard you tryKeep that in mind, I designed this rhymeWhen I was obsessed with timeAll I know, time was just slipping awayAnd I watched it count down to the end of the dayWatched it watch me and the words that I sayThe echo of the clock rhythm in my veinsI know that I didn't look out belowWhen I watched the time go right out the windowTrying to grab hold, trying not to watchI wasted it all on the hands of the clockBut in the end, no matter what I pretendThe journey is more important than the end or the startAnd what it meant to me will eventually be a memoryOf a time whenI tried so hard, and got so farBut in the end, it doesn't even matterI had to fall, to lose it allBut in the end, it doesn't even matterHey yoOne thing, I don't know whyIt doesn't even matter how hard you tryKeep that in mind, I designed this rhymeTo explain in due time; All I knowHa, I so-socialize, like the host of the partyI spoke, shaked, and made eye contactParty and toast, showing all thatNortheast, Southwest coast, I'm starin' out the windowNo opportunity to mingle; I tried to sew it up,To weaken your system, I had you throwin' upI brought you back other things,Like imaginary man of your dreamsYou'd always seem to make it worth itI pig skin, I never Nerf itYou felt leather never pleather real bringin' the pleasureBy any means it means, I'm leaving your teamA hell of a team, man it seems butI tried so hard, and got so farBut in the end, it doesn't even matterI had to fall, to lose it allBut in the end, it doesn't even matterOne thing, I don't know howIt doesn't even matter when you look at it now'Cause when I designed this rhymeI was scared of it all, scared to fallI hadn't even tried to crawlBut I was forced to run, with you mocking meStopping me, backstabbing me constantlyRemembering all the times you fought with meWatch the clock now chock full of hypocrisyBut now your mouth wishes it could inhaleEvery single little thing you said to make things failEvery single word you sputtered just to get your pieceBut it really doesn't matter to me'Cause from the start to the end, no matter what I pretendThe journey is more important than the end or the startAnd what it meant to me will eventually be a memoryOf a time whenI tried so hard, and got so farBut in the end, it doesn't even matterI had to fall, to lose it allBut in the end, it doesn't even matterIn the end...
