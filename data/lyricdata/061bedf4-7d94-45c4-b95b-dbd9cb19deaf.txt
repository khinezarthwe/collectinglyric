Nose down, what you gonna do whenParties fade and your makeup starts to smearOnly scene is a grand entranceSilver screen is another brand new yearIn a sea of talcum powerKids swim and they lose their colorClock strikes twelveSay, don't ya feel so well?As the confetti fallsTimed with the tearsNo one wants to hearabout your hardwood floorsIn stalls of the magic markersBoys and girls come and go like coats of paintAll you've got is a pretty nameYou shouldn't be killed off in the very first sceneOn the porch with the smokersParty talk gets much olderClock strikes twelveSay, don't ya feel so well?As the confetti fallsTimed with the tearsNo one wants to hearabout your hardwood floors
