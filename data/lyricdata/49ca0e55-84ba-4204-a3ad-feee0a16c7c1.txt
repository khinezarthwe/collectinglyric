I saw you in the film for just two secondsA documentary set in heavenWhere the hipsters roll like childrenAnd the writers roll like dogsOn rugs in beds and on stagesAnd the singers hide behind the cameraI saw you in the film where the children write on glassThe sun came in like a pack of orange spanielsThrough the window over the ledgeUnder the curtain on their bellies creeping and bendingBalls of string coiled like springs hang down from the cymbal standsAnd in your hands I sleep just like a drummerI wake up with the thunder of your type-writer every nightWell every day a prayer goes on its kneesI will quit the white the wine and the weedFalls to its belly and crawls towards New YorkI saw you in the film for just two secondsOn a subway car lifting like a questionFrom Earth to the street to the bridge in the eastWhere the green man wears a hatThe sun came in like a pack of orange spanielsThrough the window over the ledgeUnder the curtain on their bellies creeping and bendingBalls of string coiled like springs hang down from the cymbal standsAnd in your hands I sleep just like a drummerI wake up with the thunder / Just like a drummerOf your type-writer / Wake up with the thunderJust Like a drummer / Of your type-writer(x5)Just Like a drummer... / Just Like a drummer...every night.
