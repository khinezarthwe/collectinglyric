I lie in an early bed, thinking late thoughtswaiting for the black to replace my blueI do not struggle in your web because it was my aimto get caughtBut daddy longlegs, I feel that I'm finally growingwearyof waiting to be consumed by youChorus:Give me the first tasteLet it begin -- heaven cannot wait foreverDarling, just start the chase -- I'll let you winbut you must make the endeavorOh, your love give me a heart contusionAdagio breezes fill my skin with sudden redYour hungry flirt borders intrusionI'm building memories on things we have not saidFull is not heavy as empty, not nearly, my loveNot nearly, my love, not nearlyChorus (1x)
