You could be from VenusI could be from MarsWe would be togetherLovers foreverCare for each otherYou could live in the seaAnd I could be a birdWe would be togetherLovers foreverCare for each otherIf you were an illusionI would make it realWe would be togetherLovers foreverCare for each otherIf you walk in the sunI would be your shadowWe would be togetherLovers foreverCare for each other
