In a little while,People and places will be so far behindOut of my body.In a little whileI will play acesAnd raise my glass in an act of defianceUntil then, I'll scream until I'm hollowI'll carve it in my skin, save it for tomorrow.I'm gonna bang my drumI'm gonna make it comeI'm gonna bring it onIt's a heart heart attackI'm bringing it back to me.In a little whileIt will be perfect, I'll have a perfect styleSoon you will see.Not a cloud in sightNo cumulus nimbusJust ninety three percent degrees humidityBut until then, I'll scream until I'm hollowI'll carve it in my skin, save it for tomorrow.I'm gonna bang my drumI'm gonna make it comeI'm gonna bring it onIt's a heart heart attackI'm bringing it back to me.I'm out of my bodyI'm out of my body.
