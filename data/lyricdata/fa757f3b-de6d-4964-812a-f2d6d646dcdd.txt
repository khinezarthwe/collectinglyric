Let not the sun go down on my wrathI let it shake the worldVengeance is the grudge I bearflag of reckoning unfurledYou are the architectof your own demiseso smile no moreI am the gatekeeper,and you are mine for evermore[Chorus:]Come greet the reaperYou know the time is nighThis is the day of reckoning,your time to dieBrave men they spin in fearAt the sound of my voiceSay goodbye to life so dearYou no longer have a choiceBurnt black and silent,rust and bloodupon my reaper's bladeI come collect the tollsgather up all the debts unpaidI call when you least expectbut when you deserve it the mostBehold the timekeeperthe end is getting close[Chorus]The dead no longer haveA cross to bearThe dead no longer haveNeed to despairDeath has comeAnd set the snareDeath will comeWhen you are unaware[Solo: Lee][Solo: Gary][Solo: Gary][Solo: Lee]The misbegotten have the gallto think them safe and soundThey try to cheat the reaperscatter, hide, no matter, foundThe wheel of life is standing stillFor them it turns no moreNow comes the soul keeperand you become my whore[Chorus]
