Time is the promiseIt turns and tells them what to doIt makes them dishonestThey let the suspicion kill the truthBroken heart, broken mindWhen you let me inDid you not know where I had been?And love's what they wastedA lie that makes their dreams come trueThey're hiding their facesTheir smiles can break the heart in twoBroken heart, broken mindWhen you let me inDid you not know where I had been?
