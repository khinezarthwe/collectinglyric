The sunny sand we ran along, every day began uponThe summer's kiss of love and adventureAnd every dune that we fell into left a mark upon us tooEtched forever as a moment we'd remember, oh and we'd rememberThe empty woods where we played, every hour of every dayThe holidays went on foreverAnd in the woods was a soldier's tomb, the ghost of which looked over youAnd God was there amongst the trees, we felt his whisper as the summer's breezeAnd every night and every day I learned to love it in a special wayAs I remember, what it's like to walk amongst butterflies
