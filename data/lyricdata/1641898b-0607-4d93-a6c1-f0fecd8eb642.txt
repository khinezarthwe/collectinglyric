I'm gonna set my soul on fireMy heart beats low while the flames go higherStrike the match and then the truth is toldI'm gonna set my soul on fireThe Devil made me a woman, I ain't no liarHer eyes burn black like the lake of fireShe struck the match and then I sold my soulFor the black haired girl from the lake of fireI'm gonna set my soul on fireMy heart beats low while the flames go higherStrike the match and then the truth is toldI just set my soul on fire
