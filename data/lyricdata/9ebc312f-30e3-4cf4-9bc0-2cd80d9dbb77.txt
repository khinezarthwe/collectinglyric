I look at the sunriseI look at it earnI look into your eyesDon't know where to turnI'm gonna drift into that voidI'm flying through spaceI'm an asteroidI'm dancing that place when you're paranoidI'm thinking about you and nothing elseThink about you, you think about meThink about you, counting the beatThinking about you, thinking about meThinking about just you and mela-dah-da-de, there ain't no place I'd rather bela-da-de-da, la-da-de-da, la-da-de-da...(12)I'm bleeding to deathOn the cloudiest dayThree-four-five beatA-waltzing awayI'm counting the beat, two-three-four-fiveI'm feeling the heat, glad to be aliveI'm counting the beat, six-seven-eight-nineI'm wishing that you, that you were mineThink about you, you think about meThink about you, counting the beatThinking about you, thinking about meThinking about you, thinking about methinking about youÂ ?think about, just you and mela-dah-da-de, there ain't no place I'd rather bela-da-de-da, la-da-de-da, la-da-de-da...(36)
