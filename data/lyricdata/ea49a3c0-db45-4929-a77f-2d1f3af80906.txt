All that I have is all that you've given meDid you ever worry that I'd come to depend on youI gave you all the love I had in meNow I find you've lied and I can't believe it's trueWrapped in her arms I see you across the streetAnd I can't help but wonder if she knows what's going onYou talk of love but you don't know how it feelsWhen you realise that you're not the only oneOh you'd better stop before you tear me all apartYou'd better stop before you go and break my heartOoh you'd better stopTime after time I've tried to walk awayBut it's not that easy when your soul is torn in twoSo I just resign myself to it every dayNow all I can do is to leave it up to youOh you'd better stop before you tear me all apartYou'd better stop before you go and break my heartOoh you'd better stopStop if love me(you will remember)Now's the time to be sorry(that day forever)I won't believe that you'd walk out on meOh you'd better stop before you tear me all apartYou'd better stop before you go and break my heartOoh you'd better stop
