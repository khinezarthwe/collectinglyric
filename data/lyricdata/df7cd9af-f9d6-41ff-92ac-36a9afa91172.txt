She exits her gold chariotOne pump at a timeCloaked in her matching pin-stripesArsenal of next month's nowsShe grazes through the darkDowntown concrete planesShe seeks a special killA flesh she's never had beforeA prey whose blood is rich with loveI want to sink my teeth intoSkin I can't see throughI'll clench my jaw deep down insideLick my lips hoping to findA taste of life with youHoles freckle her hipsShe's sick of breaking necksWith designer prints, French tipsHer shoes as red as lipsEvery meal tastes alikeI want something I can biteLike the tethers of this dietLet the shackles fill my cheeksFeed these itching jowlsFlush my painted teethMy palate has been cleansedI want to sink my teeth intoSkin I can't see throughI'll clench my jaw deep down insideLick my lips hoping to findA taste of life with youI want to sink my teeth intoSkin I can't see throughI'll clench my jaw deep down insideLick my lips hoping to findA taste of life with youJewels and stones cut so preciseHeld up by a ringCatches all glances and looksHoping to distract fromThe finger to the leftSo bare and unfurnishedNamed for sporting such hardwareWith dreams cut so preciseShe's held up by her stringsShe catches all glances and looksHoping to find someone that canDress her naked handI'll tear my heart right outAnd have you sport it as hardware
