Boy I wish you weren't such a paranoid actressAnd I the assassinated candidateI feel like an accidental speciesSome mutant love-child, never meant to beNo motion dancing, feel like we're an impossibilityTrying to keep the heart in the head but I was so down on the closing nightCouldn't even fake a smile, wanting to fire all my friendsAnd just start over againAh! Sisters don't you knoowww, our shit is only gonna get betterAh don'tcha know don'tcha know don'tcha knoowwwI feel like the last time is gonna bemy final collapseAh! Sisters don't you knoowww, our shit is only gonna get betterOhh ohh aahhh ahhhhI feel like the last time is gonna bemy final collapseI know from past experienceHe never takes it easy on his readersAnd you'll become a foreign substance lying in your familial bedTechnology makes such an ugly motherBut no lessons does it offer only chaos scenariosAnd the dream that we've inherited, look it's just like numbersStill they love you at the office cause you've been the subject of countless masturbation fantasies(Ohh oh)
