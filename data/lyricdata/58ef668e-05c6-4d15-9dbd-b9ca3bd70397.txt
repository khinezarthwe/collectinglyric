Sometimes these words just don't have to be saidI know how you both feel, the heart can rule the headJealousy is an essential part of loveThe hurting here below and the emptiness aboveThere's always something left behindThere's always something left behindNever mindThe tender caresses that bring out the manI can't still be drunk at fiveOh, I guess I surely canSlowly your beauty is eaten awayBy the scent of someone else in the blanket where we layThere's always something left behindThere's always something left behindMaybe next timeUneaten mealsA lonely starA welcome ride in a neighbor's carA long walk homeThe pouring rainI fell asleep when you never cameSome rare delight in Manchester townIt took six hours before you let me downTo see it all in a drunken kissA stranger's hand on my favourite dressThat was my favourite dress, you knowThat was my favourite dress
