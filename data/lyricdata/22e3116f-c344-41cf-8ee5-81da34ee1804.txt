Your issue may walk among fine moral spiresBut if they went up somebody else built themYour store is a small one, your goods have no buyersYour parents are raising your children.O I could have told you the vices won't hold you warm in a coil where you layBut high up they hang you, seized by the templeAnd bid you obey and obey...A heinous, heinous lawOf an endless, endless loveThat governs your poor heartIn its velvety chambers, where fellows foul metEngage in exchangesWhose ends are to put out your lightsWho know from the inside you'd put up a fightTo a heinous, heinous law...It's winter in my bedroom and I stir the broken springAnd I have in my head to go crawlingWhen the hounds come around I go to the bottleLike every wet shadow before me.Now are you angry at me 'cos I'm no longer free?I don't sound it or say it or feel it.But out on the street somebody told meIt happens to everyone.So I don't blame you, it's my foot in my shoeAnd I seem to have easily filled itWhile the thing in my charge, whether tiny or largeI fear I may slowly have killed itObeying a heinous, heinous law...
