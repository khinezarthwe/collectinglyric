Navy wives, what'cha waiting forThere's cracks on the ceiling, the wallpaper's peelingAnd a bottle breaks on the kitchen floorShe sweeps it to the side as she's walking out the doorSo please, just take it easyI know you've been drinking but I've been thinkingSo please don't you cryDon't let them make up your mindIt's nothing, if I can recallBut I have been known to be wrongIt's nothing, if I can recallBut I have been known to be wrongI confess if you were rightBut there's no way to show it, you're acting so tightDon't tell me what you've learnedCause there's nothing that you can say that I ain't already heardSo please just take it easyI know you've been drinking, and not clearly thinkingSo please don't you cryDon't let them make up your mindIt's nothing if I can recallBut I have been known to be wrongIt's nothing if I can recallBut I have been known to be wrongJanuary feels like July, she leaves my scarf long out on the lineWax paper skins looking dry,Gets caught on the doors, she slowly walks byAs she reminded me time after time if you look back once the problem is mineShe reached the end of the lineWell you left everything in a messWhen then day is done it's still an empty nestIt's nothing if I can recallBut I have been known to be wrongIt's nothing if i can recallBut I have been known to be wrongWell you left everything in a messWhen then day is done it's still an empty nest
