Listen as the wind blows from across the great divideVoices trapped in yearning, memories trapped in timeThe night is my companion, and solitude my guideWould I spend forever here and not be satisfied?And I would be the oneTo hold you downKiss you so hardI'll take your breath awayAnd after, I'd wipe away the tearsJust close your eyes dearThrough this world I've stumbledSo many times betrayedTrying to find an honest word to findThe truth enslavedOh you speak to me in riddlesAnd you speak to me in rhymesMy body aches to breathe your breathYour words keep me aliveAnd I would be the oneTo hold you downKiss you so hardI'll take your breath awayAnd after, I'd wipe away the tearsJust close your eyes dearInto this night I wanderIt's morning that I dreadAnother day of knowing ofThe path I fear to treadOh into the sea of waking dreamsI follow without prideNothing stands between us hereAnd I won't be deniedAnd I would be the oneTo hold you downKiss you so hardI'll take your breath awayAnd after, I'd wipe away the tearsJust close your eyes...
