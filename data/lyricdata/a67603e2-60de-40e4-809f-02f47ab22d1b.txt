After school, a friendship walking homeWe fled across the fields, until we were aloneTo a bridge, that stood close by the seaThe day that we spent there, is ours eternallyI don't have to tell youI'm sure you understandThe first who lay beside meMade me what I am (oh, she made me what I am)A smile, in these ungrateful timesMakes all that you left me seem more worthwhileBut no, I couldn't really dareTo show how much I miss youIsn't that unfair?I don't have to tell youI'm sure you understandThe first who lay beside meMade me what I am (oh you made me what I am)And no matter how it endsYou should always keep in touch with your friends
