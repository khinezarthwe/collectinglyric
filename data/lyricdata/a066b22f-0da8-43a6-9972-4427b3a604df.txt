So let me take this medicineto quench my love for violent things.My swan song willbe like a bullet laced in angeras the razor cuts the soft spot on your heel.(Each Breath) It's getting slower.(This war) It's getting harderto fight by myself.(Sick Waves) A bitter fashion.(Rip Down) this shield that I have.Tears rain from above.Do you see the life I lead?So follow me into the sunand I will bleed the poisons dry.These bayonet scars never seizeto blind the light shed from the beastand all we do is hate.(Eyes Shot) from constant visions.(Angels) Rendered uselessgood has lost its heart.Do you see the life I lead?So follow me into the sunand i will bleed the poisons dry.For you [x2](For you!) [x3]Bite to break skin.Don't give the secret.My stoic facebeating with passionThe Phoenix will dieinside the firestorm.I am the son.Follow my footsteps. [x2]
