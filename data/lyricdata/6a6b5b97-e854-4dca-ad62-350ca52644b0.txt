How peaceful it feels against my faceOh, what a long haulYou brought me here for thisI see nothing but disasterNow I'm taking you with me, taking you with me.A transparent scenery that comes as fast as it leaves.Now my eyes flash with whiteIt's settling in with all the flickeringHere again, x2The floor is more fitting for, the floor is more fitting for my face.Here again? x2This is getting old. x2Here again? x2I am being watched, this is overwhelmingParanoia. x2As you dig your feet in I will sink my teeth in the floor,While I lay here alone.As the light begins to breach the border,While I lay here alone.Aware of every step, I'm not aware at all, x2Black. Flash white. x2I am awake.
