Drop your silver in my tambourineHelp a poor man fill a pretty dreamGive me pennies, I'll take anythingNow listen while I playMy green tambourineWatch the jingle jangle start to shineReflections of the music that is mineWhen you toss a coin, you'll hear it singNow listen while I playMy green tambourineDrop a dime before I walk awayAny song you want, I'll gladly playMoney feeds my music machineNow listen while I playMy green tambourineListen and I'll play
