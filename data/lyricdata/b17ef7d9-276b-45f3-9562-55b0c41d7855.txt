So long ago, I don't remember whenThat's when they say I lost my only friendWell, they said she died easy of a broken heart diseaseAs I listened through the cemetery treesI seen the sun comin' up at the funeral at dawnWith the long broken arm of human lawNow, it always seemed such a wasteShe always had a pretty faceI wondered why she hung around this placeHeyCome on, try a littleNothing is foreverThere's got to be something better thanIn the middleBut me and CinderellaWe put it all togetherWe can drive it homeWith one headlightShe said it's coldIt feels like Independence DayAnd I can't break away from this paradeBut there's got to be an openingSomewhere here in front of meThrough this maze of ugliness and greedAnd I seen the sign up aheadAt the county line bridgeSayin' all is good and nothingness is deadWe'll run until she's out of breathShe ran until there's nothin' leftShe hit the end, it's just her window ledgeHeyCome on, try a littleNothing is foreverThere's got to be something better thanIn the middleBut me and CinderellaWe put it all togetherWe can drive it homeWith one headlightWell, this place is oldIt feels just like a beat up truckI turn the engine, but the engine doesn't turnWell, it smells of cheap wine and cigarettesThis place is always such a messSometimes I think I'd like to watch it burnI'm so alone and I feel just like somebody elseMan, I ain't changed, but I know I ain't the sameBut somewhere here in between the city walls of dyin' dreamsI think your death, it must be killin' meHey, hey, heyCome on, try a littleNothing is foreverThere's got to be something better thanIn the middleBut me and CinderellaWe put it all togetherWe can drive it homeWith one headlight
