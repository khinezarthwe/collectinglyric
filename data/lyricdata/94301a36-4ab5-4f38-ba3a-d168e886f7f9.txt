Get Back, get back again and againBeen here since I can remember whenMy life is a boat, being blown by youWith nothing ahead, just the deepest blueTo me you're like a setting sunYou rise, then you're goneTo me you're like a setting sunYou rise, then you're goneCome back, come back again and againI've been here since I can remember whenThe world just spins whilst mine stands stillNothing's changed in your gravity graveTo me you're like a setting sunYou rise, then you're goneTo me you're like a setting sunYou shine, then you're goneTo me you're like a setting sunYou shine, then you're goneTo me you're like a setting sunYou shine, then you're goneGo down on your lightSo bright, it burns my eyesSounds like a perfect wayTo end my lifeTo me you're like a setting sunTo me you're like a setting sun
