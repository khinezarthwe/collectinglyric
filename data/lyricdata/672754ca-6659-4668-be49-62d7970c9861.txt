Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahYour love for me came as a waterfallFlowing inside me like never beforeYour love for me something I didn't seeBut baby, I know better nowWhen you walked in the room that very nightA special feeling just burst insideIt was only you, nobody else but baby,I know better nowChorusDon't wanna love you, if you don't love meDon't wanna need you when you won't need me tooDon't wanna tell you this nowBut it wouldn't be right if I (if I)Didn't tell you this tonightYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahAnd now you're back inside my house againI'm trying deeply to explain'Cause baby I wanna get it onAnd baby, you're the one for meAnd now that I have got you all aloneAfter all this talking on the phoneI should be strong, there's nothing wrongI'll tell you this is where you belong(2x Chorus)There was something in your eyes made me realizeNow I hear voices deep inside telling me, telling me it's you and I(2x Chorus)
