(Chorus)Sharp darts spitting mastersSpitting darts fasterShut up I'm the driver, you're the passengerI'll reign superiorThe pressure blows the dial on your barometerDo you understand?Or do you need an interpreter?Now my style is distinguishedAll fires are extinguishedAsk yer girl to sing and she'll sing thisI'm a scientistHave no prejudice, that's my hypothesisMake your analysis, ever heard a beat like this?I walk the beat like a policemenNo karma pedestrianIn 500 years they'll play this song in museumsI'm the bold adventurerUK's ambassadorHolding up ExcaliburYour beats are inferiorDon't wanna embarrass yerSo call yer solicitorThe jury voted unanimously against ya!(Chorus)Sharp darts spitting mastersSpitting darts fasterShut up I'm the driver, you're the passengerI'll reign superiorThe pressure blows the dial on your barometerDo you understand?Or do you need an interpreter?This one's fat like yer motherContains enough caloriesResonating all your favourite frequenciesI've got a worldwide warrantySatisfaction guaranteeIf you ain't happy then justSend it right back to meRespect to BCBut it's time to fuck loyaltyOne day I hope to earn some hard royaltiesFrom a bit of sample robberyHook burglary, noise thieveryOr wholesale piracySo watch yer back, I'm inclined to sampleI'll dismantle and make you all examples(Chorus)Sharp darts spitting mastersSpitting darts fasterShut up I'm the driver, you're the passengerI'll reign superiorThe pressure blows the dial on your barometerDo you understand?Or do you need an interpreter?(Chorus)Sharp darts spitting mastersSpitting darts fasterShut up I'm the driver, you're the passengerI'll reign superiorThe pressure blows the dial on your barometerDo you understand?Or do you need an interpreter?
