As I walk this land of broken dreamsI have visions of many thingsBut happiness is just an illusionFilled with sadness and confusionWhat becomes of the brokenheartedWho had love that's now departed?I know I've got to findSome kind of peace of mind, maybeThe roots of love grow all aroundBut for me, they come a-tumbling downEvery day, heartaches grow a little strongerI can't stand this pain much longerI walk in shadows, searching for lightCold and alone, no comfort in sightHoping and praying for someone who'll careAlways moving and going nowhereWhat becomes of the brokenheartedWho had love that's now departed?I know I've got to findSome kind of peace of mind, help me, pleaseI'm searching, though I don't succeedFor someone's love, there's a growing needAll is lost, there's no place for beginningAll that's left is an unhappy endingNow what becomes of the brokenheartedWho had love that's now departed?I know I've got to findSome kind of peace of mindI'll be searching everywhereJust to find someone to careI'll be lookin' every dayI know I'm gonna find a wayNothing's gonna stop me nowI'll find a way somehowAnd I'll be searching everywhereI know I'm gonna find it there
