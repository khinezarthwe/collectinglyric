Now it's 10am and I'm startling slowI've got a shirt like a couch, belt unbuckled belowIt's an awful fit and it's all for showAnd it's framing a face you'll see for the first timeNow it's 2pm and I'm ready to goI've got my face face-down feeling gravity growI've got six set of sneakers set out in a rowOr I'm out the door and onto the punchlineAnd I forget just what it is I was hoping forI forget that I knowThat I've never even heard you speakAnd all my words just jump and squeakWith this awkwardnessBut I thought that was just a line"I'm concerned and you're consigned"I thought you were someone elseI thought this shirt was pretty fucking swell
