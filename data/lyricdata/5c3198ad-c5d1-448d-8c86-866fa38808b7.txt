Don't damn meWhen I speak a piece of my mind'Cause silence isn't goldenWhen I'm holding it inside'Cause I've been where I have beenAn I've seen what I have seenI put the pen to the paper'Cause it's all a part of meBe it a song or casual conversationTo hold my tongue speaksOf quiet reservationsYour words once heardThey can place you in a factionMy words may disturbBut at least there's a reactionSometimes I wanna killSometimes I wanna dieSometimes I wanna destroySometimes I wanna crySometimes I could get evenSometimes I could give upSometimes I could giveSometimes I never give a fuckIt's only for a whileI hope you understandI never wanted this to happenDidn't want to be a manSo I hid inside my worldI took what I could findI cried when I was lonelyI fell down when I was blindBut don't damn meWhen I speak a piece of my mind'Cause silence isn't goldenWhen I'm holding it inside'Cause I've been where I have beenAn I've seen what I have seenI put the pen to the paper'Cause it's all a part of meHow can I ever satisfy youAn how can I ever make you seeThat deep inside we're all somebodyAn it don't matter who you wanna beBut now I gotta smileI hope you comprehendFor this man can say it happened'Cause this child has been           condemnedSo I stepped into your worldI kicked you in the mindAn I'm the only witnessTo the nature of my crimeBut look at what we've doneTo the innocent and youngWhoa listen to who's talking'Cause we're not the only onesThe trash collected by the eyesAnd dumped into the brainSaid it tears into ourconscious thoughtsYou tell me who's to blameI know you don't wanna hear me cryin'An I know you don't wanna hear me denyThat your satisfaction lies in your ILLUSIONSBut your delusions are yours and not mineWe take for granted we know the whole storyWe judge a book by its coverAnd read what we wantBetween selected linesDon't hail meAn don't idolize the inkOr I've failed in my intentionsCan you find the missing linkYour only validation is living your own lifeVicarious existence is a fucking waste of timeSo I send this song to the offendedI said what I meant and I've never pretendedAs so many others do intending just to pleaseIf I damned your point of viewCould you turn the other cheekBut don't damn meWhen I speak a piece of my mind'Cause silence isn't goldenWhen I'm holding it inside'Cause I've been where I have beenAn I've seen what I have seenI put the pen to the paper'Cause it's all a part of meDon't damn meI said don't damn meI said don't hail meDon't damn meSmoke 'em if you got 'em!Alright, that sucked!
