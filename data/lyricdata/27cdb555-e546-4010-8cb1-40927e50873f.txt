So here I amDoin' everything I canHoldin' on to what I amPretendin' I'm a supermanI'm tryin' to keepThe ground on my feetIt seems the world is fallin' down around meThe nights are longI'm singin' this songTo try and make the answers more than maybeAnd I'm so confused about what to doSometimes I wanna throw it all awaySo here I amGrowin' older all the timeLookin' older all the timeFeelin' younger in my mindAnd here I amDoin' everything I canHoldin' on to what I amPretendin' I'm a supermanI'm tryin' to sleepI lost count of sheepMy mind is racin' faster every minuteWhat could I do moreYeah, I'm really not sureI know I'm runnin' circles but I can't quitAnd I'm so confused about what to doSometimes I wanna throw it all awayControllin' everything in sightFeelin' weak I don't feel rightYou're tellin' me I have to changeTellin' me to act my ageBut if all that I can doIs just sit and watch time goThen I'll have to say good-byeLife's too short to watch it flySo watch it flySo here I amGrowin' older all the timeLookin' older all the timeFeelin' younger in my mindAnd here I amDoin' everything I canHoldin' on to what I amPretendin' I'm a superman
