These are the days, the end completeA world still turning to the sound of the sufferingYou are the jury, we are the saints.Our minds divide, the past repeatsA war still brewing in the hearts of those we once bledI am the knowing... the living dead.Dig deeper, rememberAll you've been and all you've left behindWave goodbye, my dearDig deeper, rememberAll you've been and all you've left behindWelcome home, my dear.No words to say, the worst displayedWhat once was courage is now cursed in the hurt we've madeWe are the sinners, before our graves.Now leave in peace, the dead unsavedA world still turning down the path towards the end completeNow spite me, jury, I've come for change.Dig deeper.
