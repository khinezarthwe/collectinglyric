Remember when I dove into the crowdAnd I got a bloody knee under my skin, a mark from wiping outIt brings back the memoriesEvery bone's been brokenAnd my heart is still wide openI can't stopDon't care if I loseBaby you are the weapon I chooseThese wounds are self inflictedI'm going down in flames for youBaby you are the weapon I chooseThese wounds are self inflictedOne more thing I'm addicted tooWith each scar there's a map that tells a story what a souvenirof Young love's like jumping outAn airplane riding a tidal wave on an ocean of emotionMy heart rips me wide openI can't stopDon't care if I loseBaby you are the weapon I chooseThese wounds are self inflictedI'm going down in flames for youBaby you are the weapon I chooseThese wounds are self inflictedOne more thing I'm addicted tooAnd I cover up these scarsAnd I can't stop seeing starsWhenever you're aroundAroundI can't stopDon't care if I loseBaby you are the weapon I chooseThese wounds are self inflictedI'm going down in flames for youOohhh, you are the weapon I chooseThese wounds are self inflictedOne more thing I'm addicted toI can't stop no I can't stopno I can't stopOhh, I'm going out in flamesOhh, I'm going down in flamesOhhhhBaby you are the weapon I chooseBaby you are the weapon I choose...
