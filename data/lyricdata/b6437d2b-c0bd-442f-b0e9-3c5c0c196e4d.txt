Now one fell asleep in the street and he never woke upNow one died in pieces in his bed with the mouth full of bonesAnd one threatened me long ago when I saw him melt in the bright light of dayAnd one laid to rest in a field under starlings and crows, heyI've been wandering sidewaysI've stared straight into the sunStill, I don't know why you're dyingLong before your time has comeYour time has comeNow one took some bullets in the chest in a deal gone wrongOne got a little too depressed and he went and jumped the gunOne got shot right in the face and he somehow survivedBut he doesn't know my name or who I am and I'm not surprised, heyI've been wandering sidewaysI've stared straight into the sunStill, I don't know why you're dyingLong before your time has comeYeah, I've been wandering sidewaysAnd I've stared straight into the sunStill I don't know why you're dyingLong before your time has comeYour time has come, heyI've seen 50,000 names all engraved on a stoneMost of them met an early grave years before I was bornAll of them left brothers and sisters and mothers behindAnd most of their family and friends alive, doing timeI've been wandering sidewaysI've stared straight into the sunAnd I don't know why you're dyingLong before your time has comeYeah, I've been wandering sidewaysI've stared straight into the sunAnd I don't know why you're dyingLong before your time has comeLong before your time has comeLong before your time has comeYour time has come
