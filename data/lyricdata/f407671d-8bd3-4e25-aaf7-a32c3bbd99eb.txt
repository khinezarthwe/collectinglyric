I can't breatheWhen you're with me,I can't even thinkI swallow every promiseYou can never keep Now thatI see you for whatIt is that you areI know there's nothing thatYou can do anymoreDon't take this wrong,No Your never wrongBut I'll tell you somethingYou mean nothingI'll tell you somethingYou mean nothing to me nowAs I wander throughThis joke thatI call a life I wonderWhy I even tried to make it mineDon't take this wrong,No Your never wrongBut I'll tell you somethingYou mean nothingI'll tell you somethingYou mean nothing to me nowAs you can seeI already can feel no moreIgnorance is good whenYou've found there's nothing leftBut I'll tell you somethingYou mean nothingI'll tell you somethingYou mean nothing to me now
