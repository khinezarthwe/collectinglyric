Let's say the world was a legal padand everything was two dimensional.But somehow you were the third coordinateand you were towering over our college rule.Would you draw me with your pencils and your pens,make me much prettier than I really am?And could you draw us with some picture perfect friends if I chipped in for the ink?Let's say you spilled all your coffeeon us while you weren't looking.And all our world was stained, awake, and drowned.And all your doodling looked pretty foul.Would you draw me air bubbles so I could breathe?Or at least some chlorophyll making trees?If I got erased would you even still love me?Or would you just draw yourself another he?
