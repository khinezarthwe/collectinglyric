[Chorus:]If I could play guitar, then I'll play it,But I can't so I'll just sing it, sing itI wrote S-O-R-R-Y,I'm tellin you that,And I don't know why,Maybe because I was sky-high,And thinking to much about my life.So I turned off the light,And I tried to rap,But only bullshyt left my mind,And most of the time I was fine,But you're windin me up while I'm hard on my grime.When were you born? 1985Why didn't you finish school? Because I skied.Step back, get back,Comment on my face yeh,I'm just tryin to live my life.[Chorus]I feel a little tired,I feel like cryin,I feel like lyin,I feel like not tryin to doWhat I was supposed to do today.(Fuk)A couple of interviews,A photo shoot,A show to do,Promote new tunes.Oh I hate it when I feel this way,Oh why do I feel this way?Tell me...Yesterday was a different story,High and mighty,Feeling glory.Shut down time square,Know that you saw me.Felt enormus, like twenty stories.[Chorus]Today of all days,You try to rush me.Hush puppy, let me do my thing,I'm not your puppet on a string brov...(Really?)Now don't get me on,You silly little punk.Expect me to walk,Cause I'm not gonna run.I wish life was as easy as playing the guitar,Ya just pick it up and ya strum.(Eeeh, maybe not)[Chorus]
