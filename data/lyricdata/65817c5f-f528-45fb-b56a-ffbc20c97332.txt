Ravens in the air, noone in the streetsSeems like the fiend he must be backRiding on his horse but also flying in the iarLove has just started to crack - owWhisplash and torture, falseness and painEnvy is driving our hateEverything out there is mad and confusedTill we'll be able to seal each others fateStaring through eyes of hate and able to killWe don't realize we've been given our ownFuckin' will, like animals humans don't thinkDon't look for a reason, we hate no styleWe put the blame on the demonSacred hell, sacred hellThere is nothing but names on the wallYou can be free, you can reach tomorrowSacred hell, sacred hellSo the fend must be back on our ballLose all your sins, lose all your sorrowsNo lucid intervals, no people who guideBut a 1000 Masters of disguiseEternal damnation 'cause humans they hideThey think that satan shall rise
