Bought on stolen wineA nod was the first stepYou knew very wellWhat was coming nextDid I really walk all this wayJust to hear you say"Oh I don't want to go out tonight""Oh I don't want to go out tonight"Oh but you willFor you mustI don't owe you anythingBut you owe me somethingRepay me nowYou should never go to themLet them come to youJust like I doJust like I doBut did I really walk all this wayJust to hear you say"Oh I don't want to go out tonight""Oh I don't want to go out tonight"But you willFor you mustI don't owe you anythingBut you owe me somethingRepay me nowToo freely on your lipsWords prematurely sadOh but I know what will make you smile tonightLife is never kindLife is never kindOh but I know what will make you smile tonight
