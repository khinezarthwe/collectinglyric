Tossed into my mind, stirring the calmYou splash me with beauty and pull me down'Cause you come from out of nowhereMy glance turns to a stareObsession rules me, I'm yours from the startI know you see me, our eyes interlock'Cause you come from out of nowhereMy glance turns to a stareOne minute here and one minute thereDon't know if I'll laugh or cryOne minute here and one minute thereAnd then you wave good-bye...Sifting to the bottom, every day for twoAll energy funnels, all becomes you'Cause you come from out of nowhereMy glance turns to a stareOne minute here and one minute thereDon't know if I'll laugh or cryOne minute here and one minute thereAnd it hurts insideOne minute here and one minute thereAnd then you wave good-bye...
