Let us have peace, let us have lifeLet us escape the cruel nightLet us have time, let the sun shineLet us beware the deadly signThe day is comingArmageddon's nearInferno's comingCan we survive the blitzkrieg?The blitzkriegThe blitzkriegSave us from fate, save us from hateSave ourselves before it's too lateCome to our need, hear our pleaSave ourselves before the earth bleedsThe day is dawningThe time is nearAliens callingCan we survive the blitzkrieg?
