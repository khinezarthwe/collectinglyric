Making an apperance at a club tonightPlaying some songs that I think are alrightI'm not post-modern just a man who can barkand bite with teeth that leave a markIn the winter your eyes are greyBut in the spring they sparkle awayI'm on a mission to make some amendsFor whilst I'm gone this might all endOh it's like I'm part of the jetsetRespectively, I haven't been that reckless....yetDrift through the air like a paper planeRainbow colours pulsate through the brainI'm aware that I'm speaking but the words come out wrongSo I'll put it across in a simple songOh it's like I'm part of the jetsetRespectively, I haven't been that recklessNever have I been part of any sceneJust remember this: it's just you and meWhen you're alone it's trueI break my bones for youMy soul is constantly beaten black and blueNever have I been part of any sceneJust remember this: it's just you and me....Oooooh  JetsetterOooooh  JetsetterOooooh  JetsetterOooooh  Jetsetter
