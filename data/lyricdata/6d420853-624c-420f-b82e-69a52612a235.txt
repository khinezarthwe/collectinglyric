There was no time for painNo energy for angerThe sightlessness of hatred slips awayWalking through winter streets aloneHe stops and takes a breathWith confidence and self-controlI look at the world and see no understandingI'm waiting to find some sense of strengthI'm begging you from the bottom of my heart to show me understandingI need to live lifeLike some people never willSo find me kindnessFind me beautyFind me truthWhen temptation brings me to my kneesAnd I lay here drained of strengthShow me kindnessShow me beautyShow me truthThe way your heart sounds makes all the differenceIt's what decides if you'll endure the pain that we all feelThe way your heart beats makes all the differenceIn learning to liveHere before me is my soulI'm learning to liveI won't give upTill I've no more to giveListening to the cityWhispering its violenceI set out watching from aboveThe 90s bring new questionsNew solutions to be foundI fell in love to be let downOnce again we dance in the crowdAt times a step awayFrom a common fear that's all spread outIt won't listen to what you sayOnce you're touched you stand aloneTo face the bitter fightOnce I reached for loveAnd now I reach for lifeAnother chance to lift my lifeFree the sensation in my heartTo ride the wings of dreams into changing horizonsIt brings inner peace within my mind,As I'm lifted from where I've spilt my lifeI hear an innocent voiceI hear kindness, beauty and truthThe way your heart sounds makes all the differenceIt's what decides if you'll endure the pain that we all feelThe way your heart beats makes all the differenceIn learning to liveSpread before you is your soulSo forever hold the dreams within our heartsThrough nature's inflexible graceI'm learning to live
