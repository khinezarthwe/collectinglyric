You looked like you were sleepingWaiting days for the twenty-twoCome onWe'll grab a chariotCome onWe'll write a soundtrackQuarter til two, the night's endingWe stand where no Romans dared to standShut upYou might sink shipsShut upYou'll lose your gold toothWe'll testify and we will declareDaydreams pile up on the interstate wherethe arch there is still a squareAnd we'll jump if you dareBut please don't dare usYou said, that you were loadedI know, cuz I think I was loaded tooCome onWe'll wait for holidaysCome onWe'll curse our weekdaysOne dollar well sings the chorusSomething a little little bigger than smallShut upThe kids make outShut upAnd watch the world spinGod damn the commies wherever they areWe need someone to blame for closing this barAnd the neon fades like a starAnd we'll wish on that starThe week goes fasterThe conversation endsand the drugs start to fadeOn the palm, deserts driftMartians paradeAnd they will attack, and we'll laughIt's alright, it's okIt don't matter todayIt's all easy, it's coolIt's alright, it's okIt don't matter tonightIt's all easy
