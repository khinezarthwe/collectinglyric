Sleep and dream of thisDeath Angel's kiss,Brings final bliss, completelyEmpty, they say,"Death, won't you let me stay?"Empty, they say,"Death, hear me call your name!"Ooh, call your nameSuicide... I've already diedYou're just the funeral I've been waiting forCyanide... Living dead insideBreak this empty shell forevermoreWait, wait patientlyYour death-black wings unfoldingSleep spreading o'er meEmpty, they say,"Death, won't you let me stay?"Empty, they say,"Death, hear me call your name!"Ooh, call your nameSuicide... I've already diedYou're just the funeral I've been waiting forCyanide... Living dead insideBreak this empty shell forevermoreSay, is that rain or are they tears,That's stained your concrete face for years?The crying, weeping, shedding strifeYear after year, life after lifeAn air of freshly broken groundA concrete angel laid right down,Upon the grave which swallows fastIt's peace at last, oh, peace at lastEmpty, they say,"Death, won't you let me stay?"Empty, they say,"Death, hear me call your name!"Call your name!Suicide... I've already diedYou're just the funeral I've been waiting forCyanide... Living dead insideBreak this empty shell forevermoreForever more!Forever more!It's just the funeral I've been waiting for!
