This is the happy house -- we're happy hereIn the happy house -- oh it's such funWe've come to play in the happy houseAnd waste a day in the happy houseIt never rainsWe've come to scream in the happy houseWe're in a dream in the happy houseWe're all quite saneThis is the happy house -- we're happy hereThere's room for you if you say you doBut don't say no or you'll have to goWe've done no wrong with our blinkers onIt's safe and calm if you sing alongThis is the happy house -- we're happy here in the happy houseTo forget ourselves -- and pretend all's wellThere is no hellI'm looking through your window
