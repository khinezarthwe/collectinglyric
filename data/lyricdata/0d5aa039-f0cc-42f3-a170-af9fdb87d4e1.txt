I'm on the outside looking in at the still lifeA force of habitA state of mindIf we agree on anything I hope it's that we still want the good lifeA change of habitA change of clothesRemember when we got caught stealingRemember when we had that feeling all the timeAnd remember in New York CityYou asked me "Do you think I'm pretty now" all the timeAll the timeYou're far away, far awayI'm on the corner checking out all the blue steelA force of habitA change of heartThe sun rarely sees me and I'm running around at nightAnd I'm running around to find I've heard this beforeRemember when we got caught stealingRemember when we had that feeling all the timeAnd remember in New York CityYou asked me "Do you think I'm pretty now" all the timeAll the timeYou're far away, you are so far awayAnd in the end we're standing on different streetsBut in the end we know what we believeRemember?Remember in New York CityYou asked me "Do you think I'm pretty now" all the timeAnd remember when we got stealingI wish I could have that feeling all the timeAnd remember in the Garden of EdenWe thought we could have this freedom all our livesOr just one more timeLean on meNow you're far away, you are so far awayYou're far away, you are so far away
