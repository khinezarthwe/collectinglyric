In the time of the Edison girlsI was listening to every wordThere was something happeningDressed in clothes that my family woreLeft the world by which they all sworeBut stop before you say you willCause we know that you never willIt's just a lieAnd there's a tightrope running through the living roomAnd there's a sidewalk made of gasAnd there's a light bulb broken at the bottom of the swimming poolAnd there's a reason why I'm goneYou can leave my name out of your bookWith the doctors, forefathers and crooks who invented historyWho'll invent the time machine?But for now I'm just hanging aroundDream my dreams in cylindrical soundBut stop before you say you willCause we know that you never willIt's just a lineAnd there's a tightrope running through the living roomAnd there's a restaurant on fireYou're like a cyclone blowing through everyone you knewAnd there's a reason for it now.
