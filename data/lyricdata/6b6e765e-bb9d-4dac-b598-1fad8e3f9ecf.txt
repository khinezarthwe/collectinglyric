Ecstasy is all you needLiving in the big machine nowOh you're so vainNow your world is way too fastNothing's real and nothing lastsAnd I'm awareI'm in love but you don't careTurn your anger into lustI'm still here but you don't trust at allAnd I'll be waitingLove and sex and lonelinessTake what's yours and leave the restSo I'll surviveGod it's good to be aliveI'm torn in piecesI'm blind and waiting forMy heart is reelingI'm blind and waiting for youStill in love with all your sinsWhere you stop and I begin, and I'llI'll be waitingLiving like a house on fireWhat you fear is your desireIt's hard to dealI still love the way you feelNow this angry little girlDrowning in this petty worldAnd I'm who you run toSwallow all your bitter pillsThat's what makes you beautifulYou're all or notI don't need what you ain't gotI'm torn in piecesI'm blind and waiting forMy heart is reelingI'm blind and waiting for youI'm blind and waiting for youI'm blind and waiting for youNo I can't believe it's coming trueGod it's good to be alive and I'm still here waiting for youNo I can't believe it's coming trueI'm blind and waiting for you
