A dedication to all the refugees worldwide...One timeSay, say, sayI remember when we used to sitIn the government yard in Brooklyn.Observing the crookednessAs it mingled with the good people we meet.Good friends we had, Good friends we've lostAlong the way.In this great future you can't forget your past,So dry your tears I say And to my peeps who passed away,No woman, no cry, no woman no cry,Say say say.Hey little sister don't shed no tearsNo woman no crySay say say.I remember when we used to rockIn a project yard in Jersey,And little Georgie would make the firelight,As stolen cars passed through the nightAnd then we'd hit the corner storeFor Roots, paper, and brew.My drink's, my only remedyFor pain of losing family, but while I'm gone Shorty,Everything's gonna be alright, everything's gonna be alright,Fugees come to the dance tonight, everything's gonna be alright,Everything's gonna be alright,O everything's gonna be alright,The gun man's in the house tonight,But everything's gonna be alright.Oh ah oh ahOh ah oh ahOh ah oh ahOh ah oh ahOh ah oh ahOh ah oh ahOh ah oh ahOh ah oh ahNo woman no cry,No woman no cry.Hey, little sister, don't shed no tearsNo woman no crySay say say.I remember when we used to sitIn a government yard in Trenchtown.Observing the hypocritesAs they mingled with the good people we meet.Good friends we had Oh good friends we've lostAlong the way hey.In this great future, You can't forget your pastSo dry your tears I sayAndNo woman no cry.No woman no cry say say say.Hey, little sister, don't shed no tearsNo woman no cryAnd to my peeps who passed awayOh ah oh ahOh ah oh ahOh ah oh ahOh ah oh ahOh ah oh ah
