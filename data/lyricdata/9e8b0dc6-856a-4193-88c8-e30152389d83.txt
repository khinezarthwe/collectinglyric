The messiah's come and goneHe's left half a dozen flags to stake his claimMaybe i should jump start, singing the national anthemLie belly up in the sunBlistering out like a bottle of beerI need a slow dive into the country to calm my nervesI'm only dancing on the roof topsThinking about what i've got to doMaybe i'll get drunk and change the world some other dayThis is a great great divideThis is a great great divideThis is a great great divideAnd there was nothing in betweenThe musicians have left the buildingOh god i'll never meet them nowI wanted them to sign my chest and wish me a happy christmasOh well there's next timeTonight i'm gonna cut off my handLet the blood it curls down put a smile on the face of my friendI'm only dancing on the roof topsThinking about what i've got to doMaybe i'll get drunk and change the world some other dayThis is a great great divideThis is a great great divideThis is a great great divideAnd there was nothing in betweenAnd there was nothing in between
