It does not take much to destroy a manGive him rope and he will hangSame can be said for a dynastySo fat with itself, can no longer feedRome will burn when it's time has comeOttoman tribes fade awayThe social cults empower puppet menLeaving me to pull the strings(chorus)Kingdoms fall to the groundCrushed by their own greedAn unquenching need to destroyEmpires fall by my designLust for power speedsTime people need to destroyYour future's clear if you can look backEvery culture's earned their fateYour gluttony as my tool of choiceYou've proved you're worthless every day(chorus)
