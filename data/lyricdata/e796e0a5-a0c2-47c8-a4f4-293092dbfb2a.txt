I don't play the fool 'cause I'm not actingDon't know the angles, I've stopped protractingThe earth is flat unless you're an astronautThis tune is vibration if your hearing is shotand all that I know is every day I know lessand the best things in life don't make any senseI studied your face while you were asleepYou looked connected to something quite deepAs I get older I start to lose touchMaybe because I don't sleep as muchI grit my teeth, when I sleep I get tenseand the best things in life don't make any senseand the best things in life don't make any senseOf course there's love, it goes without sayingAny talk of an answer would just be noiseand little bits of spit sprayingI flipped through the pictures and let the words lieMosied through the market to smell and not buyWearing dark glasses at night wrecks your eyesBut pain can look cool when it's at its bestand the best things in life don't make any senseand the best things in life don't make any senseand all that I know is every day I know lessand the best things in life don't make any sense
