Growing up in a biosphereWith no respect for bad weatherThere's still roaches and ants in hereSo resourceful and cleverHer great grandfather saw the futureDidn't know nothing about panicHe certainly probably thoughtThat it was unthinkableThere's a trace of mint wafting in from the northSo we don't fuck with the four oh oneIt's bigger than us or larger than we bargainedI guess it's just not doneHis great grandfather worked for GoodyearHe'd see the blimp on SundaysWonder what the driver knewAbout making rubber tiresTerrariumTerrariumThere's submarines out there under the iceAvoiding and courting collisionAn accident's sometimes the only wayTo worm our way back to bad decisionsMy great grandfather was a welderHe helped build the titanicHe certainly didn't thinkThat it was unsinkableBuilding up to the larger pointWith an arrogance not rare or prettyWe don't declare the war on idlenessWhen outside it's cold and shittyWe stay inside and try to conjure the fathersOf the injured and fakingIf there's a glory in miraclesIt's that they're reversibleTerrariumTerrarium
