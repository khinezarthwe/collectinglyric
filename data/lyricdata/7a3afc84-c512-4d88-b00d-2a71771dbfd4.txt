I don't have time to stand here with youFighting about the size of my dickI've got a meeting to get toAnd a gun to pick up firstAnd I don't have time to stand in the rainFighting about all the same things againIf I don't leave nowThen I'll be too late to ever get backAnd in 24 hours I've lived a hundred livesI've shot one man dead and watched another two dieAnd it's touch and go if I should run or hideAnd it's touch and go if I can live through the nightWell I've got the money and I've got the truckBut it's too close to call whether I've got the luckBut I'm too far in to even dream of getting back outAnd I wish all the fightingHad taken less timeI could have been in and outWe could have laughed through the nightBut sometimes days can be secondsAnd seconds can be your whole lifeAnd in 24 hours I've lived a hundred livesI've shot one man dead and watched another two dieAnd it's my turn now and I'm not surprisedI never thought that I would live through the nightIt's not the bullet that causes the painIt's the hole that it leaves when it comes out againAnd the blood in the sunshineDisappears just like the rainAnd I'm dying for breathingI'm blind in one eyeBut here's what I chooseTo take me into the nightYou beautiful and drunk and singing softly to yourselfYou beautiful and drunk and singing softly to yourself
