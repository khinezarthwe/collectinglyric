Soma is what they would take whenHard times opened their eyesSaw pain in a new wayHigh stakes for a few namesRacing against sun beamsLosing against fig treesIn your eyesAnd I amStopAnd goIn your eyesSaid I amStopAnd goIn your eyesLet's goWhen I saw her for the first timeLips moved as her eyes closedHeard something in his voice"And I'll be there", he says, then he walks outSomehow he was trying too hardTo be like themWell I amStopAnd goIn your eyesAnd I amStopOh, darling let me goTried it once and they liked itThen tried to hide itSays "I've been doing this 25 years"Well I'm not listening no moreAnd these friends, they keep asking for moreOh, but that's it
