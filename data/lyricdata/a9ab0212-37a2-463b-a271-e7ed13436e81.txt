(It is not easy)(It is not easy)Looking from a windowAt the back of a houseAt the edge of a townIt's greyLike the day when I lost itClouds overheadI talked to a flower that was almost deadMy body a prisonWhy did I do it?Someone warned me not to but I still went through it(Even in a song, you gotta remember that happiness is an option)(It is not easy)But don't give up now (so don't give up)(It is not easy)Happiness is an option (that happiness is an option)Needed somewhere to clear my headFind some strengthA warmer bedMaximum love in a minimal worldI'd never achieved itBut then I believed itSo when I lost it, how?I'm not sure nowIt was a strange feelingLike a law repealing itself(It is not easy)But don't give up now (so don't give up)(It is not easy)Happiness is an option (that happiness is an option)(It is not easy)But don't give up now (so don't give up)(It is not easy)Happiness is an option (giving it up, you feel like giving it up)I can wake up in the morningAnd not believe what I seeLook in the mirrorAnd think if that's really meI don't think I suit my faceIt's not a catastropheIt's more a philosophyLike the Russians wondering whyWe're born under a blue skyBut die in a dark forest(It is not easy)But don't give up now (so don't give up)(It is not easy)Happiness is an option (happiness is an option)(It is not easy)But don't give up now (so don't give up)(It is not easy)Happiness is an option (happiness is an option)This is neither old nor newIt's always, foreverSomewhere between sense and ambitionPleasure and decisionWe have to make a choiceWhat do we want?Everyone singing 'War! What is it good for?'While planning the next one?I don't need to winYou don't have to loseWe can chooseHappiness is an option(It is not easy)(You can choose yeah!)But don't give up now (so don't give up)(It is not easy)Happiness is an option (happiness is an option)It is not easy (no, not easy)The war within us (the war within us)But it gets easier (gets easier)The more we learn (the more we learn)I don't need to win (I don't need to win, now)You don't have to lose (you don't have to lose)We can chooseHappiness is an option(It is not easy)But don't give up now (so don't give up)(It is not easy)Happiness is an option (happiness is an option)I don't need to win (I don't need to win, now)You don't have to lose (you don't have to lose)We can choose (oo)Happiness is an option
