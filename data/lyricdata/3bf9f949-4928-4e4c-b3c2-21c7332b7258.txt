He sighs, he thinks about her for hoursHe tried, by sending her cards and flowersShe laughs. Says her only passionsAre her clothes and the food she eatsAnd German airmen...she always had a thing about themShe said, "I could tell you storiesOf all my former glories.All my secrets in the worldConfessions of an English girl!"He told her of his loveShe said "You're not tall or blonde enough"Now all his dreams are shatteredAll that ever matteredShe just laughs as he quietly slips away...He wants her but she wants fun and dangerHe wants love but she wants a handsome strangerShe's hurt once too oftenPushed him over the edgeThis won't be forgottenPoints the gun at his head
