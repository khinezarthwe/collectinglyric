The sun has risen out of the seaIt's an illusion, just the devil's trickeryMeant to deceive us, to lead us onTo break us down until the will to live is goneNever move heartOnly death stands between this lifeAnd the ever afterNothing to fear, there's no endAnd there is no final chapterFeel no painFeel no painThe stars have fallen out of the skyPay no attention to the devil's evil eyeMeant to distract us, lead us astrayTo throw us off our course until we've lost the wayNever move heartOnly death stands between this lifeAnd the ever afterNothing to fear, there's no endAnd there is no final chapterFeel no painFeel no painTime drifts onPast is goneWon't be longMust be strongWhen the time has come to say goodbyeTo all the ones we loveWe shall not fear our fate or destinyThe Gods have spoken, thy will be doneForetell the future of thy kingdom that will comeStill we ride onwards on wings of blackLong as we live there'll be no end to our attackNever move heartOnly death stands between this lifeAnd the ever afterNothing to fear, there's no endAnd there is no final chapterFeel no painFeel no painFeel no pain
