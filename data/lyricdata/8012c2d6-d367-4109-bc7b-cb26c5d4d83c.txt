The first time you lookedAt her curves you were hookedAnd the glances you took, took hold of youAnd demanded that you stayAnd sunk in their teethBit you hard and releasedSuch a charge that you needAnother touch, another taste, another fixShe just might get you lostAnd she just might leave you tornBut she just might save your soulIf she gets you and she gets you any closerAnd she leads you upPoints out skylines and starsSteeplechases and bars and took your keysAnd demanded that you stayThe city longs well for rooftops and invitationsAll lace and secret placesShe moves you to touch with her handsAnd she just might get you lost(She just might get you lost)And she just might leave you torn(She just might leave you torn)But she just might save your soulIf she gets you and she gets you any closerUnder the cool sheet where the welcome touchOf skin and skin will meetHot on the inside, where the girl's prizeIs at the tip of your tongueWhere every move and each impulseBrings clarityTo stay like this is everythingYou'll ever needShe just might get you lostAnd she just might leave you tornBut she just might save your soulIf she gets you any closerAnd she just might get you lost(She just might get you lost)And she just might leave you torn(She just might leave you torn)But she just might save your soulIf she gets you any closer(If she gets you any closer)And she just might get you lost(She just might get you lost)And she just might leave you torn(She just might leave you torn)But she just might save your soulIf she gets you any closerCan you believe your eyes?
