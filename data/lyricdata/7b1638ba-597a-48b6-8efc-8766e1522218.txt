Ambulance, let me inDon't make me stay hereAmbulance, hold your breathWe're running short on airAmbulance, resuscitateAt the edgeYou see clearlyI was deadNow I'm back to lifeAnd love is a fragile thingWe all stand on a bridgeThat's been slowly burning downAmbulance, take me backTo the house I was born inAmbulance, finish itDon't wake me up againAmbulance, resuscitateAt the edgeYou see clearlyI was deadNow I'm back to lifeAnd love is a fragile thingWe all stand on a bridgeThat's been slowly burningBreathe in, breathe outResuscitateWe can't go on hearing thisAre we clearSend a car, take him backClearJust one more timeBreathe in, breathe inWhile there's still timeWe could be the heartbeatOf everything nine tenths collapsedCome back to lifeWe could be the breath of airJust get to the lungs of the dyingCan you feel a pulseIt's been stopped for so longCan you start itCan you feel a pulseIt's been stopped for so longLet's restart itWith a gentle handWith a thousand voicesWith a single wordWelcome backWhen aloneYou see clearlyI would knowNow I want to live and loveAll these fragile thingsWe all stand on a bridgeThat's been slowly burning down
