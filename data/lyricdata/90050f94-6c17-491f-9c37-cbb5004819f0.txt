Coming home after a long, long walkComing home after a dozen of walksComing home after a long, long warComing home after a dozen of warsWe are out of windWe have pockmarked chinWe have lots of waterWe turn the other cheek and we winOne thousand stories and there's always moreWe've been offered one more lap to goIn my hand I hold a keyIt's dear to me cause I know where it leadsWe are out of windWe have pockmarked chinWe have all this waterWe turn the other cheek with a grin
