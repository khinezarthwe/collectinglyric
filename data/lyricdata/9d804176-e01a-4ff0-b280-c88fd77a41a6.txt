There once was a song which acknowledged itself in the wordsIt was like when your parents heard The BeatlesRipped the wind from our lungs and left us defeatedIt made me and Duncan embrace when the awesome guitars swellAnd the bass cuts out so it's just the voice and the riffThere once was a song which dismantled itself in the wordsIt set sail, while in Shea Stadium they shouted:"We collected the fragments as they radiated outwards"The guitars fell from their hands as chords decomposedAnd champagne explodes on the bowsOf a song that shifts from blows into hits
