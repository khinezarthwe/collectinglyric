I just can't help thinkingWhat you've done to meYou built a wall of love and tore it right downIn front of meAnd you think you know what's going onYou keep telling me that I am wrongI don't care about what you do'Cause if you mess with me I'll get rid of youThe picture you see is no portrait of meIt's too real to be shown to someone I don't knowAnd it's driving me wildIt makes me act like a childYou think I am crazy, but what can I doYou waste your time, like my moneyIt ain't so funny, but it's true(Don't waste my money, baby)Now you can't tell me what's going onAnd that I am weak while you are strongWhat is it you need, that makes your heart bleedDo you really know? 'Cause it doesn't showThe picture you see is no portrait of meIt's too real to be shown to someone I don't knowAnd it's driving me wildIt makes me act like a childThe picture you see is no portrait of meIt's too real to be shown to someone I don't knowAnd it's driving me wildIt makes me act like a child
