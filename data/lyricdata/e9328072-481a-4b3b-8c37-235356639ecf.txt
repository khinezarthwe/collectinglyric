[Altus/Piercy/White]Rip the pages from the book of liesNever will we ever fall to compromiseNow we're back to set the record straightFueled by anger, our pain has turned to hateSymptoms of stagnation are coming to an endSolitude's frustration has been our only friendNow we must break free.Mercy is no virtue when the mercyful is betrayedThere must be some kind of justice before it's too lateRight at you straight between the eyesThis relentless attack will be no disguiseThings have been said that just are not trueHear what I say when I say this to youSymptoms of stagnation are coming to an endSolitude's frustration has been our only friendNow we must break free.Mercy is no virtue, that's what the merciless sayWhen justice is lost, the system fails, and all we do is payTake a look around, 'cause the band is back in townAnd vengeance and revenge is what they seekIf you see them coming you better step asideBecause now they'll show no mercyYou can see it in their eyesBecause mercy is no virtue
