Nine million rainy daysHave swept across my eyesThinking of youAnd this room becomes a shrineThinking of youAnd the way you areSends the shivers to my headYou're going to fallYou're going to fall down deadAs far as I can tellI'm being dragged from here to hellAnd all my time in hellIs spent with youI have ached for youI have nothing left to giveFor you to takeI have no more empty heartOr limbs to breakAnd the way you areSends the shivers to my headYou're going to fallYou're going to fall down deadAs far as I can seeThere is nothing left of meAnd all my time in hellWas spent with you..You're going to fallYou're going to fallYou're going to fallYou're going to fall
