When the power chords come crashing downGo tearing through my sensesIt's for the strong, not for the weakIn light and dark dimensionIt stimulates, regeneratesIt's therapeutic healingIt lifts our feet up off the groundAnd blasts us through the ceilingBetween the eyesI hear it screamingAnd it electrifiesYour inner feelingsHot shock waves charge the airAll heads are bangingFists pumping everywhereGuitars are crankingHeavy metal, heavy metalWhat do you want?Heavy metal, heavy metalWhat do you want?Ten thousand lights come blazing downWith razor sharp precisionThe speakers pour out molten steelThe beat gives double visionAn armour plated raging beastThat's born of steel and leatherIt will survive against all oddsStampeding on foreverBetween the eyesI hear it screamingAnd it electrifiesYour inner feelingsHot shock waves charge the airAll heads are bangingFists pumping everywhereGuitars are crankingHeavy metal, heavy metalWhat do you want?Heavy metal, heavy metalWhat do you want?Heavy metalHeavy metalWhat do you want?Hot shock waves charge the airAll heads are bangingFists pumping everywhereGuitars are crankingHeavy metal, heavy metalWhat do you want?Heavy metal, heavy metalWhat do you want?Heavy metal, heavy metalWhat do you want?Heavy metal, heavy metalWhat do you want?Heavy metal, heavy metalWhat do you want?Heavy metal, heavy metalWhat do you want?Heavy metal, heavy metalWhat do you want?Heavy metal, heavy metal
