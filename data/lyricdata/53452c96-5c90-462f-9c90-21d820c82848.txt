You haven't been around for a couple days,and I won't pretend to understand why I'm feeling this way.A combination of no obligations, a relief,and a sinking thought like I've got something just out of reach.You must wonder what's going through my mind besides the alphabet, counting to six and prehistoric times.Sitting on the couch because I want to be alone, barely able to express myself aloud when you're at home.Adjusting to having to think about more than myselfis not so simple for me, and I know you can tell.I never once considered that I might rather be alone.Tell me you didn't tell your mom we're not getting along.
