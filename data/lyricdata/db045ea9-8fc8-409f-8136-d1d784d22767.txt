Another sunny day, I met you up in the gardenYou were digging plants, I dug you, beg your pardonI took a photograph of you in the herbaceous borderIt broke the heart of men and flowers and girls and treesAnother rainy day, we're trapped inside with a train setChocolate on the boil, steamy windows when we metYou've got the attic window looking out on the cathedralAnd on a Sunday evening bells ring out in the duskAnother day in June, we'll pick 11 for football (Pick 11 for football)We're playing for our lives, the referee gives us fuck-all (Ref, you're giving us fuck-all)I saw you in the corner of my eye on the sidelinesYour dark mascara bids me to historical deedsNow everybody's gone, you pick me up for a long drive (Pick me up for a long drive)We took the tourist route, the nights are light until midnight (Light until midnight)We took the evening ferry over to the peninsulaWe found the avenue of trees went up to the hillThat crazy avenue of trees, I'm living there stillThere's something in my eye, a little midge, so beguilingSacrificed his life to bring us both eye to eyeI heard the Eskimos remove obstructions with tongues, dearYou missed my eye, I wonder why, I didn't complainYou missed my eye, I wonder why, please do it againThe lovin' is a mess, what happened to all of the feeling? (All of the feeling)I thought it was for real, babies, rings, and fools kneeling (Babies, rings, and fools kneeling)And words of pledging trust and lifetimes stretching foreverSo what went wrong, it was a lie, it crumbled apartGhost figures of past, present, future haunting the heart
