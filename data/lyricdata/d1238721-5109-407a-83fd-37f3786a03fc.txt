You were standing in your favourite lightYou thought you were hot thought that you were tightI've seen you and I know your typeI know you'll be at the party tonightScenery, that's all you are to meScenery, that's all you'll ever beDyed blonde hair makeup packed on thickThe way you look could make your mother sickGave me that look that I've seen beforeGive up babe I find your type a boreNothin to say but you said a lotAnd in the end that's what you gotYou think you're special but I can't agreeYour empty lines don't make it with meMade the party like I knew you wouldTried to impress me like you thought you couldIt's all a game but I know the rulesGirls like you are backstage foolsTook from you all I could takeYour being here is a big mistakeYour empty lines got you a ticket to flyAnd I've decided to say goodbye
