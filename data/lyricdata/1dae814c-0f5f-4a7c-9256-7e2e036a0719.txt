I know I've been mistakenBut just give me a break and see the changes that I've madeI've got some imperfectionsBut how can you collect them all and throw them in my faceBut you always find a way, to keep me right here waitingYou always find the words to say, to keep me right here waitingAnd if you chose to walk away, I'd still be right here waitingSearching for the things to say, to keep you right here waitingI hope you're not intendingTo be so condescending it's as much as I can takeAnd you're so independentYou just refuse to bend so I keep bending till I breakBut you always find a way, to keep me right here waitingYou always find the words to say, to keep me right here waitingAnd if you chose to walk away, I'd still be right here waitingSearching for the things to say, to keep you right here waitingI've made a commitmentI'm willing to bleed for youI needed fulfillmentI found what I need in youWhy can't you just forgive meI don't want to relive all the mistakes I've made, along the wayBut I always find a way, to keep you right here waitingI always find the words to say, to keep you right here waiting'Cause you always find a way, to keep me right here waitingYou always find the words to say, to keep me right here waitingAnd if I chose to walk away, would you be right here waitingSearching for the things to say, to keep me right here waiting
