Stands still(2x)I'm still waiting.I'm still fighting.Wake me from this sleep,So I can begin living,Or give me the solution,So I can start dying.Will I start living, or start dying?Maybe I'll do better on my own.Why does everything disappear?When all I see is you aloneAnd her love moves slowly'Tis time now I'm dying for you to call my name.I'm waiting still fading.So tell me I am not alone
