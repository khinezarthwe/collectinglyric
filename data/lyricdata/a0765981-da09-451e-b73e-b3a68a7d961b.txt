Oh my loveIt's not time for us to sayOur farewellNot to deny ourselvesFrom ourselvesAnd with the timeThe season passesOnce againMemories that hangIn autumn's windMemories that hangOnce againYou areThe drug in my veinsAnd I'm waitingTo feel it againAnd I'm waitingTo feel it again, again...Through the yearsLove radiates throughoutLife's charadeShines through everythingThat remains unsaidShines through everythingThat remains unsaidYou are the drug in my veinsAnd I'm waiting to feel it againYou are the drug in my veinsAnd I'm waiting to feel it again...
