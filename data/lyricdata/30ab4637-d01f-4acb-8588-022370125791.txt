I can't see the wood for the treesLife is like a roller coasterI can't find the birds or the beesHope theyâ€™re down the back of my sofaFeeling like a rolling stonePlaying the guitar on my ownI'm the apple of my eyeIf only I could keep myself sober i'd remind myself whyThey stare at me wherever I goWhy won't everybody give up, noI wish I learn to play pianoIf only I could keep myself sober for more than one day
