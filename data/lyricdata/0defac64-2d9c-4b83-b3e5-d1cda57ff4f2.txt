You come through the door like a bag of rocksWounded all the timeAnd I'm inside the tomb with the t.v. on muteElijah don't you comeOh god don't you comeI steal out the window like I'm using the doorWhispering willows outsideTurn into statues of you, fangs exposedBreathing fireElijah don't you comeOh god don't you comeLocate the coffin and procure the ringI'll distract GabrielIts your destiny after allJust goAnd don't you ever look backKiss me againAnd don't you listen to the voices in the pastThey liedWhen you see the lights don't you dare go inFind your way back to the houseAnd the wind upon gateWhen the gate swingsBack and forthThat's the signAnd we are never coming backOnce the signal is firedWhen you're in the room I am under the bedI am inside your soulI cover your mouthHands just as iceScreaming ElijahOh Elijah come downCome and take your awardLocate the coffin and procure the ringIll distract GabrielIts your destiny after allJust goAnd don't you never look backKiss me againAnd don't you listen to the voices in the pastThey lied, run away from the light run away from the lightLittle ones.
