I can remember daysThings weren't always this wayI used to make you smileIf only for a whileBut now you can't get throughThere's no way I can loseI know some days are hardBut don't you make mine too'Cause I can't stand itWhen you come home and we just fight for hoursBut I won't show itNo, I'll just hold my breath and keep it quietEvery little earthquakeEvery little heartbreak going unheardEvery little landslideCatch it in my hand, I won't say a wordEvery time you hurt meI know that it's working, making you mineEvery clap of thunderOnly makes me stronger on the insideHow many countless nightsI've tried my best to hide?Soon as you slam the doorMy tears fall to the floorI know that people changeMaybe you're not to blameBut must you burn a holeSo deep into my soul?'Cause I can't stand itWhen you come home and we just fight for hoursBut I won't show itNo, I'll just hold my breath and keep it quietEvery little earthquakeEvery little heartbreak going unheardEvery little landslideCatch it in my hand, I won't say a wordEvery time you hurt meI know that it's working, making you mineEvery clap of thunderOnly makes me stronger on the insideEvery little earthquakeEvery little heartbreakEvery little landslideCatch it in my hand, andEvery little earthquakeEvery little heartbreakEvery little landslideCatch it in my hand, andEvery little earthquakeEvery little heartbreakEvery little landslideCatch it in my handEvery little earthquakeEvery little heartbreak going unheardEvery little landslideCatch it in my hand, I won't say a wordEvery time you hurt meI know that it's working, making you mineEvery clap of thunderOnly makes me stronger on the insideEvery little earthquakeEvery little heartbreakEvery little landslideCatch it in my hand, andEvery little earthquakeEvery little heartbreakEvery little landslideCatch it in my hand
