We're a ship without a stormThe cold without the warmLight inside the darkness that it needs, yeahWe're a laugh without a tearThe hope without the fearWe are coming homeWe're off to the witchWe may never, never, never come homeBut the magic that we'll feel is worth a lifetimeWe're all born upon the crossWe're the throw before the tossYou can release yourself but the only way is downWe don't come aloneWe are fire we are stoneWe're the hand that writes and quickly moves awayWe'll know for the first timeIf we're evil or divineWe're the last in lineWe're the last in lineTwo eyes from the eastIt's the angel or the beastAnd the answer lies between the good and badWe search for the truthWe could die upon the toothBut the thrill of just the chase is worth the painWe'll know for the first timeIf we're evil or divineWe're the last in lineWe're the last in lineWe're off to the witchWe may never, never, never come homeBut the magic that we'll feel is worth a lifetimeWe're all born upon the crossYou know we're the throw before the tossYou can release yourself but the only way you go is downWe'll know for the first timeIf we're evil or divineWe're the last in lineWe're the last in lineSee how we shineWe're the last inWe're the last inWe're the last inWe're the last inWe're the last inWe're the last in lineWe're a ship without a stormWe're the cold inside the warmWe're a laugh without a tearWe're the far without the nearWe're the last in lineWe're the last in lineWe're the last in lineSee how we shineWe're the last in line
