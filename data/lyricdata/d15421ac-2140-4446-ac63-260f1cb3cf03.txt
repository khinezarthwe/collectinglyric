She waited there just like she said she wouldBut it was all too much when she said that she loved meI felt right there and then as if I couldReach out and touch the stars above meAnd I surrenderI can't forget herI still rememberEvery word she saidAnd I want herShe kind of launched aFlying saucerRight inside my headThere are a lot of things I thought I'd never doBut one look in her eyes and I knew what I was missingThat's why I thought I'd come and talk to youOh well you seem so wise, but I'm not even listeningBecause my fireballIs going to callIt's getting lateShe knows I'll waitOh I surrenderI can't forget herI still rememberEvery word she saidShe got me spinning>From the beginningI see her faceIn outer spaceOh I want herShe kind of launched aFlying saucerRight inside my head
