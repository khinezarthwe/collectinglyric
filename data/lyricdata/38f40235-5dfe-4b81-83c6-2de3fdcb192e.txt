A bold young farmer courted meHe stole my heart and my libertyHe stole my heart without free goodwillAnd I must confess that I love him stillI wish, I wish but it?s all in vainI wish I was a maid againBut a maid again I never can beSince such a young fellow lies still by meThere sits a bird in yonder treeSome say he?s blind and cannot seeAnd I wish it was the same with meBefore I took up with your companyI wish my babe so tiny was bornAnd smiling on his father?s kneeAnd I poor girl was dead and goneWith the green grass growing all over meGo dig my grave, dig long and deepPlace a marble stone at my head and feetAnd on my heart put a snow white doveTo let the world know that I died for love
