I had a dreamI was a human beingWhat good in me?I guess I'm only humanHorrible as it seemsIt's better than a ghostIt's better than a robotIt's better than a demonMaybe even better than a dog or a treeI see your mouthIt seems to be movingAnd I hear the sounds you makeI guess they must be wordsThey don't mean a thingIt doesn't take muchTo string some words togetherThrow em all aroundSomeone will believe themYou might even believe them yourself
