How did you get so big?Did you eat too much?Did you bite off more than you could prove?So Hollywood,You're riding with the starsAnd all the regulars know just who you areI've got the biggest heartYou've ever torn apartYou fooled with the wrong guyFooled with the wrong guyFooled with the wrong guyFooled with the wrong guyHow did you get so drunk?I guess you had enoughYou swallowed more than we all knewSo many friendsOnly hold you when you got dreams for themTo sink their teeth intoBut it don't mean a lot when it's all been boughtYou fooled with the wrong guyFooled with the wrong guyFooled with the wrong guyFooled with the wrong guyWhen you fooled with me
