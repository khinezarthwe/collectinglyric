They call her MississippiBut she don't flow to meSpends her light on the BayouBut she don't come to seeShe's the one that makes my dreamsThey call her MississippiBut she don't flow to meThe shape of her horizonMakes the morning sunWhen she puts her eyes onEach and anyoneShe's the one that makes me fallMidnight moon shines through it allShe's the one that makes me fallMidnight moon shines through it allShe's the one that makes my dreamsThey call her MississippiBut she don't flow to meThey call her MississippiBut she don't flow to me
