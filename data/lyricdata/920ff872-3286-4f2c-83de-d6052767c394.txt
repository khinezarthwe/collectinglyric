Engorged to overflowPump your filthy mouths into your willing guts belowNow you shake until our master calls youShake until your mother bleedsShake until the fluid calms youStill you suckle from the one who feedsLying here beside me, take it all from my bodyOh, don't try to crawl back inside, from where you came
