Pusher be the test and I beat to the restIn my head, in my head nowSlow candle burning with your flame on high and now I'm dry land soPlay it bland, play it blandThe sound of escape now honeyTake it take itSay it lover, say it lover rightIt's all the faker, the light hearted takerSo take it, so take it, so take itDream is in this heartSeason in these yearsDeath is in this heartSo what so whatSo fine so fineSo what so whatBe mine be mineBurn it to the ground
