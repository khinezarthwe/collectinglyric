Well here I am, back in townJust as the night is comin' downWarm wind blowin' through the treesI watch them swing, I watch them swayLie here waiting for the day.Sleep won't come, I need a drinkStop my head, don't wanna thinkWishing I could be with youBut I know you're so far awayAnd I'm here waiting for the day.Water of life pour your light down on meTake me out of this darkness, sweet star of the seaWater so sweet you can open my eyesYou can bring down the rain on this desert so dry.Out on the street, shadows fallSilence speaks, I hear it callCity of the living deadCount the lights on the motorwayLie here waiting for the day (alright).Water of life pour your light down on meTake me out of this darkness, sweet star of the seaWater so sweet you can open my eyesYou can bring down the rain on this desert so dry.Yes here I am, back in townJust as the night is comin' downWarm wind blowin' through the treesI watch them swing, I watch them swayLie here waiting for the day (alright)
