You're not such a nice girl after allIt's as much as you can do just to say helloHave you got to stick your head inside that bookOh, you've noticed that I'm here, now please spare the dirty look!It's such a beautiful evening, oh would you like to go out?Oh pardon me for breathingI know you walk a different way each nightTo avoid the men on the building siteBut I waited half an hour for you to comeOh well you've missed your dad and the tea's now overdoneWell it's only part of lovingOh please don't accuse me of making something out of nothingThere's really nothing to be ashamed aboutHe's a good looking kid, I think I've worked that bit outAnd he seems to have the same desires as youBut if he's that much fun, how come I'm not laughing too?It's such a beautiful evening, oh would you like to go out?Oh pardon me for breathingI can't help the way that I am, it's only part of lovingPlease don't you tell me that I'm making something out of nothingSilly, but true, you know I can't help but feeling usedWhen the two of you get on so well togetherA quiet drink? Well what am I supposed to think?When the two of you dance so well together
