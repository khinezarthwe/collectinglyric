Uncle Sam taught him to shootMaybe a little too wellFinger on the trigger, loaded bulletHe hit the stage so full of rageAnd let the whole world know itSix feet away, they heard him say"Oh God, don't let him pull it"Please God, don't let him pull itHow could you put us through it?His brother watched you do itHow could you take his life away?(What made you think you had the right...)How could you be so full of hate?(...to take away somebody's life?)And when I heard you let him dieAnd made the world all wonder whyI sat at home and on my own,I cried aloneAnd scratched your nameOn the side of a bulletAnd in the wake of his mistakeSo many lives are brokenGone forever from a loaded bulletAnd no excuse that you could useCould pull somebody through itAnd to this day so many say"God why'd you let him do it?"How could you let him do it?How could you put us through it?His brother watched him do itHow could you take his life away?(What made you think you had the right...)How could you be so full of hate?(...to take away somebody's life?)And when I heard you let him dieAnd made the worldall wonder whyI sat at home and cried aloneand on my ownI scratched your nameOn the side of a bulletOn the side of a bulletOn the side of a bullet
