I'm drained but aching for moreAnd the devil inside is readingThe words of the saddest poemTo be engraved on the stone on my graveI'd kill to share your pain (and carry the shame)And sell my soul for you just to say:"I dream what you're dreamingAnd feel what you're feelingLove's the shadow on our wallWith the face of God"Nothing will be enoughFor the ones who keep on stumblingIn the garden of withering trustWithout the courage to leaveI'd take my life for your kiss (grant me this)And lose it all to take you across the abyssI dream what you're dreamingAnd feel what you're feelingLove's the shadow on our wallWith the face of GodYou dream what I'm dreamingAnd see what I'm seeingLove's our shadow on the wallWith the face of GodLabyrinth in the shape of a heartLove's secret architectureI find myself to be lost in theArms of your fateI'd kill to share your pain (please let me stay)And sell my soul for you just to sayLove's name in vainAgain and again...I dream what you're dreamingAnd feel what you're feelingLove's our shadow on the wallWith the face of GodYou dream what I'm dreamingAnd see what I'm seeingLove's our shadow on the wallWith the face of God
