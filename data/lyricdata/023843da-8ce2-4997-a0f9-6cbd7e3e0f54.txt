I will dive into my sleepand I dream of the pretty buildings.Wonder what she's doing nowand whether she's still living.Telegraph your points of viewand sheppard me from silence.Sitting in this fit of rage,I fall down from my pedestal.I don't wanna feel this low again...I ain't gonna steal your flame again...I don't wanna feel...'Cause you know it hurts like hell!So come out of the closet,let's talk about it.'Cause you know it hurts like hell!Flowers bloom in harmonyand mixtapes from the 60's.Fueled by the LSD,he looks into his future.I don't wanna feel this low again...I ain't gonna steal your flame again...I don't wanna feel...'Cause you know it hurts like hell!So come out of the closet,let's talk about it.'Cause you know it hurts like hell!Morning came and I was dead,before I left for school.We'll paint the smiles onto our headsand keep away from the animals.And you know it hurts like hell...So when you reach the top,just throw yourself off...And you know it hurts like hell...And that's you in a nutshell!That's you in a nutshell!And you know it hurts like hell!So come out of the closet,let's talk about it.And you know it hurts like hell!And that's you in a nutshell!That's you in a nutshell!
