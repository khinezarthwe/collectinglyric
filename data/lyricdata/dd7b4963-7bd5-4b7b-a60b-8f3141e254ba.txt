We all come in from the coldWe come down from the wireAnd everybody warms themselvesTo a different fireWhen sometimes we get burnedYou'd think sometime we'd learnThe one you love is the oneThat should take you higherYou ain't got no oneYou better go back out and find herJust like children hidin' in a closetCan't tell what's goin' on outsideSometimes we're so far off the beaten pathWe get taken for a rideBy a parlor trick or some words of witA hidden hand up a sleeveTo think that thee one you love could hurt you nowIs a little hard to believeBut everybody darlin'Sometimes bites the hand that feedsWhen I look aroundEverybody always brings me downWell is it them or meWell I just can't seeBut there ain't no peace to foundBut if someone really caredWell, they'd take the time to spareA moment to try and understandAnother one's despairRemember in this game we call lifeThat no one said it's fairOoh, yeahBreakdownBreakdownBreakdownGet down with yo' bad self, alrightI've come to know the coldI think of it as homeWhen there ain't enough of me to go aroundI'd rather be left aloneBut if I call you out of habitI'm out of love and I gotta have itWould you give it to me if I fit you needsLike when we both knew we had itBut now the damage's doneAnd we're back out on the runFunny how everything was rosesWhen we held on to the gunsJust because you're winnin'Don't mean you're the lucky onesBreakdownBreakdownBreakdownBreakdownHay yayThere goes the challengerBeing chased by the blue blue meanies on wheelsThe vicious traffic squad cars are after our lone driverThe last American heroThe-the electric sintarThe demi-godThe super driver of the golden westTwo nasty Nazi cars are close behind the beautiful lone driverThe police numbers are getting closer-closerCloser to our soul hero in his soul mobile, yeah babyThey about to strike, they gonna get him, SMASH ! RAPE !The last beautiful free soul on this planetBut, it is writtenIf the Evil Spirit arms the Tiger with clawsBrahman provided wings for the DoveThus spake the Super Guru
