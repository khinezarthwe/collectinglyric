I have my thoughts to positionBut do I know how to act?I have no silent ambitionsBut does that make me a manUntil I learn all I canAnd mean all I understandAs a way of givingI'm a piece of the earthI take no offenceI can be who I amI have no pretenceOnly to what you can beIf you want to beIt's a way of livingI've got a pen in my pocket does that make me a writerStanding on the mountain doesn't make me no higherPutting on gloves don't make you a fighterAnd all the study in the worldDoesn't make it scienceSo grab a piece in the airTry an' make it singTry and be who you canIt's the real, real thingI'm into what you can beIf you want to beAs a way of livingI've got a pick in my pocket does that make me a playerWords can't do - what action does louderPutting on gloves doesn't make me a fighterAnd all the study in the world doesn't make it science
