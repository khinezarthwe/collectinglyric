I've been driving a mid-sized carNever hurt anyoneIs that a fact?Is that a fact?Is that a fact?Is that a fact?The price of gas keeps on risingNothing comes for freeMake like a stoneMake like a plantMake like a stoneMake like a plantI can tell you how this endsWe're gonna win thisWith spades and truncheons, guns and trowelsThat is how the war will be wonJust swat the flyJust swat the flyJust swat the flyJust swat the flyTaking care of cars and bodiesNothing ever comes for freeThe ghosts are hereThe ghosts are hereRed, white and blueRed, white and blueI can tell you how this endsWe're gonna win thisWe're gonna win thisWe're gonna win thisWe're gonna win
