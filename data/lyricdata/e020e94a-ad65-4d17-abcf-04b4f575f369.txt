You been counting on a somedayOh the world, the world, the world has gone insaneOver something, over nothingGet excited over everything that's saidYou've been counting on a saviourHide your feelings, oh, you've got to keep them safeOnce a baptist, still a menaceJust a long shot everything you feel is fedLast night's a loaded gunYou better hope that the world won't end tonightAll the mothers love you sonYou better hope that the world won't end causeYou've been betting on yourself againYou're barely legal, least you still have a friendWhen you're bankrupt and you're out of luckThe odds are dropping it's about time you duckedLast night's a loaded gunYou better hope that the world won't end tonightAll the mothers love you sonYou better hope that the world won't end causeYou've come too farThink of all the people you'd hurtYou'd only make your mother cryIt's not okay, all right?Last night's a loaded gunYou better hope that the world won't end tonightAll the mothers love you sonYou better hope that the world won't end causeYou've come too farThink of all the people you'd miss.
