Watching my window I was led like a childAs the roadway lamplightsMisguided my mind through the nightA shadow of limitsWe were racing the rainMy hands held the wheelMy eyes tried to hold their placeThere must have been a timeWhen I thought that you were watchingIt had to be when my senses lost controlI thought I'd slipped awayI thought I could still feel us movingIt must have been a cloudNo bigger than a man's handEvery reason I risk my lifeTo come back to youIs locked behind your doorYou're my immunityOutside I watched you burnHeavy hearts were bleedingA cry for help, a familiar voiceMy melting hands streaked the glassAs I walked awayI wondered what had really happenedHad I run out of timeDid I push myself too farAs my last step fellI felt my hands upon the wheelHad I come back to lifeOr did I ever leave at allIn higher livesWe seem to beAlways a moment too lateWe're past the timeWhen we looked onNow we'reTHE ONES WHO HELP TO SET THE SUNThis time for realI locked the door behind meMy mind was still a wreckFrom what I sawFor when my hands are stillI'll recognize the messageNever again will my senses lose controlIn higher livesWe seem to beAlways a moment too lateWe're past the timeWhen we looked onNow we'reTHE ONES WHO HELP TO SET THE SUN
