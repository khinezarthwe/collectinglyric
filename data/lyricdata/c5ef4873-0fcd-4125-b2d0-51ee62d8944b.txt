I've nothing much to offerThere's nothing much to takeI'm an absolute beginnerAnd I'm absolutely saneAs long as we're togetherThe rest can go to hellI absolutely love youBut we're absolute beginnersWith eyes completely openBut nervous all the sameIf our love songCould fly over mountainsCould laugh at the oceanJust like the filmsThere's no reasonTo feel all the hard timesTo lay down the hard linesIt's absolutely trueNothing much could happenNothing we can't shakeOh we're absolute beginnersWith nothing much at stakeAs long as you're still smilingThere's nothing more I needI absolutely love youBut we're absolute beginnersBut if my love is your loveWe're certain to succeedIf our love songCould fly over mountainsSail over heartachesJust like the filmsIf there's reasonTo feel all the hard timesTo lay down the hard linesIt's absolutely true
