I did it all just for herI did it all just for herAnd love's heart is deathFor me and my poison girlA prey she was for the cruelty of loveWhile its serpent inside crawled straighttowards her heartThe coldest kissLove ceased to existWhile we grew apart like never beforeI did it all just for herI did it all just for herAnd love wants us deadJust me and my poison girlI did it all just for herI did it all just for herAnd love's heart is deathFor me and my poison girlThe fire in her eyes grew dim and then diedAs the poison inside reached her heartAnd the coldest bliss faith ceased to existAs we grew apart like never beforeI did it all just for herI did it all just for herAnd love wants us deadJust me and my poison girlI did it all just for herI did it all just for herAnd love's heart is deathFor me and my poison girlAnd the taste of the poison on her lipsis of a tombI did it all just for herI did it all just for herAnd love wants us deadJust me and my poison girlI did it all just for herI did it all just for herAnd love's heart is deathFor me and my poison girlPoison girl poison girlPoison girl poison girlAnd love's heart is deathFor me and my poison girlIn this poison world
