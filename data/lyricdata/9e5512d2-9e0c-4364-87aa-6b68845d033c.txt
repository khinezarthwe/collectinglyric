"These arms that hold you"Down in the shadows of your deepest secretsI sleep next to the precepts you hold most dearYour heart is in my province, hour upon hourI shiver when you feel the coldEverything you say I hearLike a bomb and its fuseWe bring bright lightBut I could be a devil to youI could bite like a tarantulaRight through the skinAnd leave my poison drippin'Deliciously unsuspectingProtecting you from all harmExcept perhaps from these armsThat hold you
