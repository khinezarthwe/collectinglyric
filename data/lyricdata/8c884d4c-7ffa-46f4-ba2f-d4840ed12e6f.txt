Time was in a vacuum when I wanted to be free, yeah yeahBut now my adolescence has all but left meI could have stayed another day, but it would be wrongBut you would just get sick of me,We both stayed far too longBut I said noI must goI'm not the one you want though I know you think so'Cause I'm a bad girl,I'm a bad girl,I'm a bad girl,But I'm too good for youMy Scooby DooOur time was so special and that means so much to meBut you can tell by the click of my heels that I am gonna leaveYou could get down on your knees and say you were so trueBut that just won't do us no good, 'cause I am sick of youAnd I said noI must goI'm not the one you want though I know you think so'Cause I'm a bad girl,I'm a bad girl,I'm a bad girl,But I'm too good for youMy Scooby Doo
