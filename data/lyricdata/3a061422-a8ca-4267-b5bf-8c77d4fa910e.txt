All these walls were never really thereNor the ceiling or the chairI'm eking weeks of peace on a beachI see the breezes weave the treesThese walls, you'll find, are yours and mineDefined not by them, II'm in times that lie behind my eyelidsThe sunset still the rising silenceI'll not feel no fearCos' I'm not really hereI'm nowhere near hereThere's no rain on roof that grates and beats meMy favourite tree breaking light to piecesSprinkling, sharded light on meThrow a stone as high as you canAnd hearing with hand not hear it landNothing taxing, dusting sandMy window world spins and twirlsThe walls then fall, I recall the sortWhite clouds white wash faded spotlessThe weighty shadows, ranges of rocksThe cold is all illusion thought upStroll on the shore, snooze and exploreAll possibilities in each new morning'Til satisfied reaching out, yawningFish in a big dish, some rice and spiceSalt over shoulder, never salted so tightThe truth I have told was silence sometimesBut who's soul does not hide any crimes?Wrapped in walls, encircled by workThe walls fall - the story occursNo barrier, no boundary or 'low us ID's (Tick tick tick tick)The freedom to stay or strayBe fiend or friend, cause no harm but charm - the peaceful endI'll not feel no fearCos' I'm not really hereI'm nowhere near hereI'll not feel no fearCos' I'm not really hereI'm nowhere near herePale ancient woods, strew white sandy baysThis ugly room pales away todayI'm swimming in the oceanI sink slow motionFingers, toes, floatingEvery year 'til yesterdayHas seen the eternal setting seaI compare all this to me;Little, fleeting, momentary meI blink my eyes, this is reminding meLife lies in the blink of an eyeThe old die for reasonsNew tides, four seasonsNew life born is like sneezingAll these walls were really never thereNor the ceiling or the chairI'm eking weeks of peace on a beachI see the breezes weave the treesI'm not here at allYou're dearly fooledI see bristling trees, the shush of the seaMischievous fluttering seagullsNo - I'm not trapped in a boxI'm glancing at rocksI'm dancing off docksSince this dance beganThat's where I amI'll not feel no fearCos' I'm not really hereI'm nowhere near hereI'll not feel no fearCos' I'm not really hereI'm nowhere near here
