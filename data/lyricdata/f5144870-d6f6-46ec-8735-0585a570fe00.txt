Blind Pew he covers you with colours of the night you'll never meet him in the carnival. Taggada takes the Jakeys for a ride.And Long John Silver is one of the few that Robbie Stevenson could champion even though the man was fake made up the kind you'd never expect to shoot one of their inmates.The horizontal stripes will lead you to the westThe vertical hill town huns will leave you own back with your tannadiction chest.The weakest character in this chapter loves dairy, shadows never shone.I never met a pretty creature who would crumble at the outcome of a cow,How come you would tell me farmers never bow.Metaphors are easy just to talk about it, growing up with spacers I can live withoutFifteen holes is never worth a stolen bike just waiting for a different cunt to say what to write.There will never be a colour in the sea if you don't have no eyes to see so please don't dwell upon your wooden leg, your limp is boring me.You see your wallpaper was red polluted with lesbian green.Red was never your colour it was never your team.Blue it never even crossed your mind because you never flew a flight,Golden treasure left you blind.Fifteen holes is never worth a stolen bike your just waiting for a different cunt to say what to write.There will never be a colour in the sea if you have not eyes to see.So don't dwell upon your wooden leg, your fucking limp is boring me.
