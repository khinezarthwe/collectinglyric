We dug these holes we crawled into now they're my homeNow here I can not feel the wind, can't feel the rain or coldAnd I believe in gentle harmonyOh how I loathe all this obscenityIs this the way my life has got to be?Have I a single opportunity?Look at me oh look at me is this the way I'll always beOh no, oh noNow I pray that somebody will swiftly come and kidnap meOh no, oh noEveryday I lie awake and pray to god today's the dayOh no, oh noHere I am oh here I am, oh when will someone understand?Oh no, oh noAnd all at once I feel this, oh how it clings to meIt reels and calls me towards some confounding destinyAnd I can feel the madness inch by inchThe more I run the more I am convincedI've colored all these like the branches twistJust like we settle in the frothy mistLook at me oh look at me is this the way I'll always beOh no, oh noNow I pray that somebody will swiftly come and kidnap meOh no, oh noAnd everyday I lie awake and pray to god today's the dayOh no, oh noHere I am oh here I am, oh when will someone understand?Oh no, oh noLook at me oh look at me is this the way I'll always beOh no, oh noNow I pray that somebody will swiftly come and kidnap meOh no, oh noAnd everyday I lie awake and pray to god today's the dayOh no, oh noHere I am oh here I am, oh when will someone understand?Oh no, oh no
