It's a good year for a murderShe's praying to JesusShe's pulling the triggerThere's no tearsCause he's not hereShe washes her handsAnd she fixes the dinnerBut soon they'll be coming to rush her awayNo one's so sure if her crime had a reasonBut reasons like seasons they constantly changeAnd the seasons of lies still like reasons are flowing, awayAway with this spilled milk?Away with this dirty dishwater?AwaySeventeen years and all that he gave was a daughterIt's me and the moon she saysI got no trouble with thatAnd I am a butterfly but you wouldn't let me dieIt's me and the moon she saysAnd it's over, it just startedThe blood stained the carpetHer heart like a crystalShe's lucid and departedA life left behind she can find in her mind, gone awayAway with these nightmaresAway with suburbia shakedownAwayYou marry a role and you give up your soul till you break downIt's me and the moon she saysI got no trouble with thatAnd I am a butterfly but you wouldn't let me dieIt's me and the moon she saysBut what do you say we go for a rideWhat do you say we get highBut I'm so tired of days that feel like the nightIt's me and the moon she saysI got no trouble with thatAnd I am a butterfly but you wouldn't let me dieAnd I am a butterfly but you wouldn't let me dieAnd I am a butterflyAnd I am a butterflyAnd I am a butterfly
