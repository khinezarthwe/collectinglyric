& how is His Highness tonight?You know it's never quite right.We bend over backwards for you;& that's the least we could doFor the spoiled little boy -Little Lord Fontleroy.& the tea is on the silver tray;Wolfhounds in the sculpture gardenThe maid has gone away,The butler begs your pardon.& you're all alone on your velvet throne - ohhh...But me & me & me -That's as far as you see.I know what it's like to be like you,Because I'm a lot like that, too.A spoiled little boy -Little Lord Fontleroy.
