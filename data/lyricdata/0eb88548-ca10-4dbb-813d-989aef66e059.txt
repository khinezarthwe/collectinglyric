[Verse 1]You're like Voodoo baby,You just take hold.Put your cards on the table baby,Do I twist do I fold?You're like Voodoo HoneyAll silver and gold?Why don't you tell me my future?Why don't I sell you my soul.[Bridge]So here it comes - the sound of drums.Here comes the drums, here comes the drumsÂ ?[Chorus]Baby, baby, baby!You are my Booby Trap - my Booby TrapDon't say maybe, maybeIt's Supernatural - I'm coming undone?[Verse 2]You're like Voodoo baby,Your kisses are cold!Feel your poison running through me?Let me never grow old.You're like Voodoo honey,My pictures you stole?You play me like a puppet.Sticking pins in a doll![Bridge][Chorus]Baby, baby, baby!You are my Booby Trap - my Booby TrapDon't say maybe, maybeIt's Supernatural - I'm coming undone?[repeat]
