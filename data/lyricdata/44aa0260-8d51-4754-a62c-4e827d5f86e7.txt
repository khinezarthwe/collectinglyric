Make you upTake you outPlay it up to bring you downTake the time to make this lastSpin the wheelWatch it crashTurn the dress to broken glassStrike a pose and hold the flashI'm not the only one who's bleedingBefore the past is done repeatingGets underneath my skinIt won't dieThis time, if I can't winThen I won't try to carry onI'll play it satiricalTonight won't be so longI'll pray for a miracleWake you upPull you outTalk you up to calm you downTurn it up to scream and shoutMake you tiredWear you outShut you up and turn you offClean you up and take you homeI'm not the only one who's bleedingBefore the past is done repeatingGets underneath my skinIt won't dieThis time, if I can't winThen I won't try to carry onI'll play it satiricalTonight won't be so longI'll pray for a miracle
