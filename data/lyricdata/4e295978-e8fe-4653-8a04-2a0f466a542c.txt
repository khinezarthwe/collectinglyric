I sit around and watch the tube, but nothing's onI change the channels for an hour or twoTwiddle my thumbs just for a bitI'm sick of all the same old shitIn a house with unlocked doorsAnd I'm fuckin' lazyBite my lip and close my eyesTake me away to ParadiseI'm so damn bored, I'm goin' blindAnd I smell like shitPeel me off this Velcro seat and get me movin'I sure as hell can't do it by myselfI'm feelin' like a dog in heatBarred indoors from the summer streetI locked the door to my own cell and I lost the keyBite my lip and close my eyesTake me away to ParadiseI'm so damn bored, I'm goin' blindAnd I smell like shitI got no motivationWhere is my motivation?No time for the motivationSmokin' my inspirationHuah!I sit around and watch the phoneBut no one's callin'Call me pathetic, call me what you willMy mother says to get a jobBut she don't like the one she's gotWhen masturbation's lost its funYou're fuckin' lonelySuh!Bite my lip and close my eyesTake me away to ParadiseI'm so damn bored, I'm goin' blindAnd loneliness has to sufficeBite my lip and close my eyesI was slippin' away to ParadiseA-some say quit or I'll go blindBut it's just a myth
