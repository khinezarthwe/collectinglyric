Kiss me in the autumn at the station by the drycleaners and the fellas selling travelcardsHold my hands and tell me that The Fall will never leave me and The Actionnettes won't break my heartWrite my name in marker pen across the local bus stop and I'll steal you all the books you loveCall the local paper and pretend we're getting married and I'll borrow you my library cardYou're the blindfold round my eyesYou're my navigation satelliteI'm a tightrope walker looking down on the sightsI don't know what happened with your sister and her mother, but I don't think they're impressed with meI don't think they like what I've been doing with my life, but can't they see it's only temporary?I can't help but worry that your friend thinks I'm a daydreamer with aspirations quite naiveThe only things worth chasing are the things that are creative, and I'm not talking accountancyYou're a red hotel on MayfairA superlative on a triple word scoreI'm a battleship, you're a direct hit and I'm sinkingAnd like falling leaves in autumn you can sweep me up or pass me byLike falling snow against your skin, or the cigarettes I can't pack inAnd falling in with you is like a Class A drug they couldn't banThe photograph that makes you smile and sends a shiver down your spineGravity's got me falling indefinitelyI don't think it matters my career path's in tatters, I could always take a course or twoTell me what you're thinking, maybe when I've finished singing, I suppose this is a family tuneI think I'm addicted, I get panicked when you're missing, I need patches when you're not aroundI have conversations in my head that you're not party to, you should have heard the things you said!Like an etching on my brainLike a letter tacked on my DNAI'm a chip pan fire, you're the water that won't stay awayAnd like falling leaves in autumn you can sweep me up or pass me byLike falling snow against your skin, or the cigarettes I can't pack inYou're the blindfold round my eyesYou're my navigation satelliteAnd just falling in with you is like a Class A drug they couldn't banThe photograph that makes you smile and sends a shiver down your spineGravity's got me falling indefinitelyTell me if it ever ends you'll let me have my heart back in a single pieceYou're the one I call after closing timeThe night bus spins to the spellbinding sound of your voice...
