I am a sacred king in a sacred kingdomYou know me just as royalityLookin' kind so you don't seeI wanna steal your virginityI was born to feign an angelThe evil knowns just how to hideI sold my soul only to riseTo build up powers that you can't fightWatch me standing proudlyTill I wake the animalAt night we bite we fightWe are power and majestyAt night we bite we fightWe are power and majestyI am a master of disguiseAnd hate to be your marionetteAnd I won't care if you'll be hangin'Shut fuckin' up and be my bedI am a reckless animalSpitting out a sacred lieTill you know my perversityIs to "play" and kill and finally dieRepeatBad, ugly and very boring"Hey baby, I wanna excuse forMy bad habits, close your eyesI've got a present for you..."
