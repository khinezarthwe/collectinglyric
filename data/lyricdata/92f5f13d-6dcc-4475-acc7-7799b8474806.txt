When I was oneMy papa dropped me on my head,And some damage was doneAround the bend and out of my treeNot how I was meant to beI don't know where, went all my senseI get lost sitting on the fenceI am the malcontented oneI don't fit in and I never have doneNo I never have doneSecond Verse, Second verseAlready lost for wordsNot complicated I'm just so frustratedI got so little to sayI don't know where, where I'm fromThey say I'm British, I don't know where I belong.I am the malcontented oneI don't fit in, I never have doneI am a disappearing boy(I am a disappearing boy)I'll lock back, I'm paranoidThird verse, still lost for wordsI don't know what to doOh my friend I'm not in the grooveNot on the same level as youI felt so lost for far too longAnd I'm past caring for how to get alongI am the malcontented oneI don't fit in, I never have doneNo I never have done(I am a disappearing boy)No, I never have doneI never, never, never have done(I am a disappearing boy)No, I never have done
