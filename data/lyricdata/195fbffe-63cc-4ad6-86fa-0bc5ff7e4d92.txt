(Gerard Love)Bound in motionFound my headwind was blowing fineI've requested the stars to shineFor words that no longer rhymeDrank the oceanMoved my feet to a different soundTried to find what was left unfoundIt's funny how it lets you downJust kick my feet off the ground, I'll embrace the skyI've got no beat in time, got no place in lineGot the notionThat this rain's never gonna last'Cos the scene always moves too fastI've read all about the pastJust kick my feet off the ground, I'll embrace the skyI've got no beat in time, got no place in lineJust kick my feet off the ground, I'll embrace the skyI've got no beat in time, got no place in lineJust kick my feet off the ground, I'll embrace the skyI've got no beat in time, got no place in line
