From the top of the flight of the wide white stairsThrough the rest of my life, do you wait for me there?There's a bell in my ears, there's a wide white roarDrop a bell down the stairs, hear it fall forever moreHear it fall forever moreDrop a bell off of the dockBlot it out in the seaDrowning mute as a rockAnd sounding mutinyThere's a light in the wings hits this system of strings from the side while they swing, see the wires, the wires, the wiresAnd the articulation in our elbows and knees makes us buckle and we couple in endless increase as the audience admiresAnd the little white dove made with love, made with love made with glue and a glove and some pliersSwings a low sickle arc from its perch in the dark, settle down, settle down my desireAnd the moment I slept, I was swept up in a terrible tremorThough no longer bereft, how I shook and I couldn't rememberAnd then the furthermost shake, drove a murdering stake in and cleft me right down through my centerAnd I shouldn't say so but I know that it was then or neverPush me back into a treeBind my buttons with saltAnd fill my long ears with beesBraying, "Please, please, pleaseOh you ought not, no you ought not"And then the system of strings tugs on the tip of my wings cut from cardboard and old magazines makes me warble and rise like a sparrowAnd in the place where I stood, there is a circle of wood, a cord or two, which you chop and you stack in your barrowAnd it is terribly good to carry water and chop wood streaked with soot, heavy booted, and wild-eyedAs I crash through the rafters and the ropes and the pulleys trail after and the holiest belfry burns sky highAnd then a slow lip of fire moves across the prairie with precisionWhile somewhere with your pliers and glue, you make your first incisionAnd in a moment of almost unbearable vision, doubled over with the hunger of lions"Hold me close," cooed the dove, who was stuffed now with sawdust and diamondsI wanted to say, "Why the long face?"Sparrow perch and play songs of long faceBurro buck and bray songs of long faceSing, "I will swallow your sadness and eat your cold clay just to lift your long faceAnd though it may be madness, I will take to the grave your precious long faceAnd though our bones they may break and our souls separate, why the long face?And though our bodies recoil from the grip of the soil, why the long face?"And in the trough of the wavesWhich are pawing like dogsPitch we, pale-faced and graveAs I write in my logThen I hear a noise from the hullSeven days out to seaAnd it is the damnable bellAnd it tolls, well I believe, that it tollsIt tolls for me and it tolls for meAnd though my wrists and my waist seem so easy to break still my dear I'd have walked you to the edge of the waterAnd they will recognize all the lines of your face in the face of the daughter, of the daughter, of my daughterAnd darling we will be fine but what was yours and mine appears to me a sandcastle that the gibbering wave takesBut if it's all just the same then will you say my name? Say my name in the morning so that I know when the wave breaksI wasn't born of a whistle or milked from a thistle at twilightNo, I was all horns and thorns, sprung out fully formed, knock-kneed and uprightSo enough of this terror we deserve to know light and grow evermore lighter and lighterYou would have seen me through but I could not undo that desireOh-oh, oh-oh-oh desireOh-oh, oh-oh-oh desireOh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh desire, ohDesire, desireDesire, desireFrom the top of the flight of the wide white stairsThrough the rest of my life, do you wait for me there?
