She'll never know thatThe girl won't keep you companyShe'll be gone in the morningWho's the girl you've been dreamig ofThe red hair in the arm chairYour life stand in the hot spot ofYou're the star in this film noirAll the loneliness of the outdoor smokerSmoking outside the clubWho's gonna save you knowWhen all the lights burn outThe advertisement hanging outFrom the car againAll the loneliness of the outdoor smokerSmoking outside the club
