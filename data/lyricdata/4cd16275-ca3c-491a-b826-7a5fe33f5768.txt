Sometimes I smell like a barrel of rotting fruitStinking up the jungle under the hot tropical sunOther times I smell like thick black swamp-waterBacked into your toilet on a warm summer dayThese are a few of my many smellsWon't you come and smell me?Won't you share my stench?Won't you come and smell me?Won't you share my stench?Once I smelled just like the bathroomAfter Grandma'd used it and she's been eating prunesOther times I smell like a city garbage strikeWhen all the horseflies grow to 3 inches longThese are a few of my many smellsWon't you come and smell me?Won't you share my stench?Won't you come and smell me?Won't you share my stench?Sometimes I smell just like death itselfA sickening sweet smellIt can really make you illSmell meSmell meSmell meSmell meSee meHear meTouch meSmell meSmell meSmell meSmell meSmell me
