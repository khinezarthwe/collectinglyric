Woke up howling at the moonLost and scaredThis place I've never been beforeLike the fear, the voices grewYou kill the beast, before he kills youHeard a scream, come on lets runIf they catch us here, we wont live to see the sunHang you by morningShoot me by gunThis dying beastFelt his heart been tornWake up, you've got the bluesHer pleasant scent, love with the queenWas cast to the shadows, to one frightful dreamThe kings black magic, scream there you'll waitThey'll die at peace, like my heart did breakWake up, you've got the blues
