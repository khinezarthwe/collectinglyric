There's a dimmer light in this room tonight.And you'll be the last one to know when it's off.So with this dimmer light in my room tonight,I wonder if we're gonna make it at all.And there's a brighter sky to this dreadful night.And you and me are the first to watch it fade.So with this brighter sky from my room tonight,I feel, down here, a little more betrayed.How do I get back to where I was, when you were smiling.You were smiling.You were smiling baby.Now there's a time to die under this heartless sky.We'll bid farewell without an ear to hear me,A time to die, and not put up a fight.Cause no one ever wanted to end this early.How do I get back to where I was, when you were smiling.You were smiling.You were smiling baby.So there's that bright light, the one that leaded me here.The one that's screaming to be noticed.The one responsible for all of this.So I'll take this other road, after I get up from my knees.Because I'm sick of being lied to.And I'm afraid of where the other one leads.You were smiling baby.
