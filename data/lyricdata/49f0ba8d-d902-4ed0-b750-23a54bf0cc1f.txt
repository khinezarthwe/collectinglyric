I've cursed this day with no regretsWith no compromiseCurse your graceShallow, this hatred that presses its finger to my lipsSimple love is to blameI won't lay my head down with this shameKiss the skyI'm always waiting here on the ground, on the groundBe warnedBe warnedBe warnedBe warnedBe warnedBe warnedBe warnedBe warnedSave with this hatred that presses its finger to my lipsBe warned she'll kill youBe warned she'll kill us allBe warned she'll kill youBe warned she'll kill us allBe warnedBe warnedBe warned she'll kill youBe warned she'll kill me
