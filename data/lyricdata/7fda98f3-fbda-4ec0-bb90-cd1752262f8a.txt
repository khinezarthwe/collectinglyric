We watch the season pull up its own stageAnd catch the last weekend of the last weekBefore the gold and the glimmer have been replacedAnother sun soaked season fades awayYou have stolen my heartYou have stolen my heartInvitation only grant farewellsCrash the best one of the best onesClear liquor and cloudy eyedToo early to say goodnightYou have stolen my heartYou have stolen my heartAnd from the ballroom floor, we are in celebrationOne good stretch before our hibernationOur dreams assured and we all will sleep wellSleep well, sleep well, sleep well, sleep wellYou have stolen, you have stolenYou have stolen my heartI watch you spin around in your highest heelsYou are the best one of the best onesAnd we all look like we feelYou have stolen my, you have stolen myYou have stolen my heart
