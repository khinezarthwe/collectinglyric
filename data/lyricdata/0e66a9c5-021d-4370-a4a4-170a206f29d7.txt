Someone tookIn these pantsSomebody painted over paintPainted woodAnd where he stoodNo one standsIt's been said he's sitting nowIn the charming landI've seen saintsBut rememberThat I forgotTo flag them down when they passAnd in the morning lightYou hold that ashtray tightYou can put it outBut I can't put it outMy hand shookDown and outI've got the blisters of the worldWorld knewI named a bookAfter youSo look up and watch the camera lensWhen the risers fadeSlow it downSong is sacredAnd brotherYour honor, hang a right at homeAnd in the morning lightI'll hold my ashtray tightI can take it downAnd you can't take it downDon't expectDon't expectDon't expectDon't expectDon't expectDon't expectDon't expect
