I dont give a fuck.I'm not afraid of the worst.I'm the sheep who lost his way.Still looking for it everyday.I'll face neglect every curse you wish to throw at me. Without trying i would never fail and i fell in love with failureI can't see through your eyes.what do you see a disgrace another lie.Today I'll start being perfect.Cut you open to expose your insides.Cut you open expose your insidesI know .I'm still counting scares from everytime you cried.And I remember the first time you died.Tonight i want to bleed along with you.Here's to craving everything you do.And I'm taking you on.and I'm taking you oncause I got nothing left to prove to you.I got nothing left to prove to you.I've got nothing left to prove
