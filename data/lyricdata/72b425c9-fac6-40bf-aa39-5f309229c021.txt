You see me now, a veteran of a thousand psychic warsI've been living on the edge so longWhere the winds of limbo roarAnd I'm young enough to look atAnd far too old to seeAll the scars are on the insideI'm not sure if there's anything left of meDon't let these shakes go onIt's time we had a break from itIt's time we had some leaveWe've been living in the flamesWe've been eating up our brainsOh, please, don't let these shakes go onYou ask me why I'm wearyWhy I can't speak to youYou blame me for my silenceSay it's time I changed and grewBut the war's still going on, dearAnd there's no end that I knowAnd I can't say if we're everI can't say if we're ever gonna be freeDon't let these shakes go onIt's time we had a break from itIt's time we had some leaveWe've been living in the flamesWe've been eating up our brainsOh, please, don't let these shakes go onYou see me now a veteranOf a thousand psychic warsMy energy's spent at lastAnd my armor is destroyedI have used up all my weaponsAnd I'm helpless and bereavedWounds are all I'm made ofDid I hear you say that this is victory?Don't let these shakes go onIt's time we had a break from itSend me to the rearWhere the tides of madness swellAnd been sliding into HellOh, please, don't let these shakes go onDon't let these shakes go onDon't let these shakes go on
