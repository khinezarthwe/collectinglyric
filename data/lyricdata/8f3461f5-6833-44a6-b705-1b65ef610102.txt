When will we get the time to be just friendsIt's never safe for usNot even in the evening 'cause I've been drinkingNot in the morning when your shit worksIt's always dangerous when everybody's sleepingAnd I've been thinkingCan we be aloneCan we be aloneWhen will we get the time to be just friendsWhen will we get the time to be just friendsAnd no I'm not ashamedBut the guilt will kill youIf she don't firstI'll never love you like herThough we need to find a time to just do this shit togetherFor it gets worseI want to touch youBut that just hurtsWhen will we get the time to be just friendsWhen will we get the time to be just friendsJust friendsWhen will we get the time to be just friendsWhen will we get the time to be just friendsJust friends
