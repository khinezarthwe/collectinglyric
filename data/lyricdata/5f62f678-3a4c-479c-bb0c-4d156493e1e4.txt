Eyes betray the soul and bear its thinkingBeyond words, they say so many things to meA stranger here, reborn it seemsAwaking wonders deep in meIf nothing's ventured, nothing's gainedSo I must seize the dayAnd fighting time, so hard I prayThat this moment lasts foreverAnd will the world stay standing still, at least for me?Through my eyes, stare into meI bear my heart for all to seeWith my face turned to the sun, there ever standing stillIt wasn't you, it wasn't me, it wasn't anythingIt was a day so long awaited and a chance to be as meI let the wind run through my handsBefore I turned to walk awayIn distant days, I long to sense it all so clearAnd fighting time, so hard I prayThat this moment lasts foreverAnd will the world stay standing still, at least for me?Through my eyes, stare into meI bear my heart for all to seeWith my face turned to the sun, there ever standing stillAnd fighting time, so much I askI will this moment last foreverThough seasons change, things come to passRemain inside of meAnd fighting time, so hard I prayThat this moment lasts foreverAnd will the world stay standing still, at least for me?I had no faith before that time in any vow or deedDays followed days and years were meaninglessDespite the wisdom of defeatI bore my heart for all to see the wonders I'd seenThe wonders I'd seenAnd fighting time, so hard I prayThat this moment lasts foreverAnd will the world stay standing still, at least for me?Through my eyes, stare into meI bear my heart for all to seeWith my face turned to the sun, there ever standing stillAnd fighting time, so much I askI will this moment last foreverThough seasons change, things come to passRemain inside of meAnd fighting time, so hard I prayThat this moment lasts foreverAnd will the world stay standing still, at least for me?
