Lookout when you hear a roarof a god when he strikes his swordEyes of fireAlmighty powerA time we danced for goldwhere dreams were bought and soldMystic nightsBurning brightFear the hammer of the godsA fight between evil mindsthe warwitch keeping timeThe knights they ridetheir will is highTo the west the spirits meanpushing hard the destinyUnholy reichBurns the nightFear the hammer of the godsWill the evil endwhen the witch's grains are thinDeadly hourHoly powerThunder crash in the skyevil knights left to dieBlood is thinFor wicked sinFear the hammer of the gods
