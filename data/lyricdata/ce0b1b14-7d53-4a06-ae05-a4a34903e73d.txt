Where do bad folks go when they die?They don't go to heaven where the angels flyThey go to a lake of fire and frySee 'em again till the fourth of JulyI knew a lady who came from DuluthBit by a dog with a rabid toothShe went to her grave just a little too soonAnd flew away howlin' on the yellow moonWhere do bad folks go when they die?They don't go to heaven where the angels flyThey go to a lake of fire and frySee 'em again 'till the fourth of JulyPeople cry and people moanThey look for a dry place to call their homeTry to find some place to rest their bonesWhile the angels and the devils try to make 'em their ownWhere do bad folks go when they die?They don't go to heaven where the angels flyThey go to a lake of fire and frySee 'em again 'till the fourth of July
