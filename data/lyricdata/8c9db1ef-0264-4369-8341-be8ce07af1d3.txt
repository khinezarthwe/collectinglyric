When I think back to the first time in my childhoodWhen I saw that face I thought right then"That's a real good looking boy"I saw myself in the mirrorIn profile for the first time I thought, "Hey!That's a real good looking boy"And I felt then that I movedWith all those lucky fucks and angelsHigh in the theatre in the skySo I went to my mother I said"Hey mom, take look at me"Have you ever seen a teen fly so high?That's a real good looking boyThat's a real good looking boyShe said, "Son, well, you knowYou're ugly boyYou don't really look like himIn this long line there's been someReal strange genesYou got 'em all, you got 'em allWith some extras thrown in"That's a real good looking boyThat's a real good looking boyThat's a real good looking boyThat's a real good looking boyWise men sayOnly fools, only fools rush inBut I, I can't helpFalling in love, in love with youNow I'm here with you little darlingAnd you say, "You're beautiful as you are"And I've managed somehow to surviveYou arrived in my life like a fragranceYou helped me find a way to laughAnd now I know how so-called beauty liesGod gave him a faceThen he gave me something aboveGod gave me graceThen he gave me your sweet, sweet, sweet loveYou make me feel like a real good looking boyI feel like a real good looking boyThat's a real good looking boyThat's a real good looking boy
