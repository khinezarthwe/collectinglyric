I'm so broke, it makes me sickI'm using cut up credit cards for guitar picksSo I'm acting quickTo earn some cash flow for the master planSo I got a jobMaking tacos for the working slobNow I can't stop'Cause there's an angel working next to meAnd things are greatNothing really matters when you're talking to the taqueria girlAnd now within a weekI've told her about the prophecyShe says to me"Let's not wait another afternoonLet's get a tankLet's rob a bankLet's go today before they closeLet's get up and let's get up andBy tomorrow no one knows"I go alongNothing can go wrong when I am talking to the taqueria girlNow I'm sitting on the ground downtown at the First National BankWith a sack of money in my right hand and in my left a hand grenadeBuddy Holly told me just the other dayTo take my songs out on the roadBut first I got to get paidAnd if things go rightWe'll leave this town with our pockets full tonightAnd it will beThe greatest thing that you have ever seenAnd if I failI'll use my only phone call to be talking to the taqueria girlI will be talking to the taqueria girl
