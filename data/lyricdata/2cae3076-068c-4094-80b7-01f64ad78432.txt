I feel like hell, you feel like dancing,You know this bar curtains a world,Those empty bottles, like sentinels,stand guard in the morning sun.Then the lights go downand all the people gather roundand you feel like you are a skeleton jaroh yeah. Oh Yeah.Be like the brother I never had,be like the real son to my dad,How can you stand there and watch thisscene, I hate you for liking me.Then the lights go downand all the people gather roundand you feel like you are a skeleton jaroh yeah. Oh Yeah. OhYeah. Oh Yeah.Why am I so miserable if these are the bestyears of my life goes by like a train I just missed out on being part of the community'don't go just stay with me' were all thatthey heard from me.Love me don't leave me just stay with medon't leave me I've never known anotherwho could just please me the way that youplease me don't go just stay with don't gojust stay with were all that they heardfrom me
