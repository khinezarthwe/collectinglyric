The crowded future stings my eyes, I still find time to exerciseIn uniform with two white stripesUnlock my section of the sand, it's fenced off to the water's edgeI clamp a gas mask on my headOn my beach at nightBathe in my moonlightAnother tanker's hit the rocks, abandoned to spill out its gutsThe sand is laced with sticky glopsOh, shimmering moonlight sheen upon the waves and water clogged with oilWhite gases steam up from the soilOn my beach at nightBathe in my moonlightI squash dead fish between my toes, try not to step on any bonesI turn around and I go homeI slip back through my basement door, switch off all that I own belowDive in my scalding wooden tubMy own beach at nightBathe in my moonlightThere will always be a moon over Marin
