Murder ascends its beautiful face and sides with meEverlasting sound is sweetAll I wanted to not be aloneBut still you always leave meI want your eyes fixed on meSo I can watch them as you screamAnd you were so beautifulBut now you'll rot and I'll celebrate to your hateAnd no one will see your faceAnd no one will dare speak your nameI won't remember your eyesI won't remember the jealousyWhat choice is left for me?What choice is left for me?This is a war I must takeTo wash these hands clear from choices that I've madeThis will be your saving graceOh, I'm not impressedStill not impressedI'm not impressedStill not impressedNow you'll rotNow you'll rotNow you'll rotNow you'll rotGoI won't remember your eyesI won't remember the jealousyI won't remember your faceAnd I'll forever curse your nameCurse your nameCurse your nameI want your eyes fixed on meSo I can watch them as you screamI want your eyes fixed on me
