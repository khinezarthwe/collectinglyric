You wanna make me sick;You wanna lick my wounds,Don't you, baby?You want the badge of honor when you save my hideBut you're the one in the wayOf the day of doom, babyIf you need my shame to reclaim your prideAnd when I think of it, my fingers turn to fistsI never did anything to you, manBut no matter what I tryYou'll beat me with your bitter liesSo call me crazy, hold me downMake me cry; get off now, baby--It wont be long till you'll beLying limp in your own handsYou feed the beast I have within meYou wave the red flag, baby you make it run run runStanding on the sidelines, waving and grinningYou fondle my trigger, then you blame my gunAnd when I think of it, my fingers turn to fistsI never did anything to you, manBut no matter what I tryYou'll beat me with your bitter liesSo call me crazy, hold me downMake me cry; get off now, baby--It wont be long till you'll beLying limp in your own hands
