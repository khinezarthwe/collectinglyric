I'm a new drug whose traffickedThrough far and distant landsI'll pump through these twisted blood streamsTo every corner of your bodyDespite all maps and bordersAnd all the wars and globesI've been led to uncharted landsForget your compass and scarsThis world will tear you apartI'm a newborn taking my first stepsEyes like bloated beach ballsThey'll surely popPop!All day I shit and eatAll night I crawl and sleepMy rattle shakesMy crib awaitsBut paved ivy's my homeDespite all maps and bordersAnd all the wars and globesI've been led to uncharted landsForget your compass and scarsThis world will tear you apartYou close your eyes to dreamI steer and strum towards mineWould you believe the gallThis universe so proudly breeds?I could abandon my coastFor the opposite edge of the statesI could vanish to the vast cavities of spaceBut one brute's consistency will forever remainMy endless potential for pain
