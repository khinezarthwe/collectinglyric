Major revelation; come to your corps,Sign the disclaimer win hope for us all.No, I won't mind being in her arms all night,All tangled up in our woollen slumber,No, wait,D.I.L.E.M.M.AYou don't even pay attention.Her elegance bathes me in grace,Perfectly ambient, it kills the ringing tinnitus.Alone, through time zones to Asia running,Lost to the scent of burning heroin.No I won't find her, even if I try,Spinning continents collide on a bedside globe light.D.I.L.E.M.M.AShe can't even get arrested.Her elegance, bathes me in grace,Perfectly ambient, it kills the ringing tinnitus.Her elegance, an infinite hum,An air so ethereal, it's clearing my lungs, curing me.You don't even pay attention. She can't even get arrested. Her elegance.
