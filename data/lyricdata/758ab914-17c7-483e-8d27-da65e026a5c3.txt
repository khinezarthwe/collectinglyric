Now I see his face, I've seen him smileSuch in a lonely place, no golden mileHis eyes tell morbid tales, of his black heartHis deeds through ages past, tell of his partSee his face, see his smileTime to dieAn angel from below, change my dreamsI want for glory's hour, for wealth's esteemI wish to sell my soul, to be rebornI wish for earthly riches, don't want no crown of thornsSee his face, see his smileTime to dieI was born a fool, don't want to stay that wayDevil take my soul, with diamonds you repayI don't care for heaven, don't you look for me to cryAnd I will burn in Hell, from the day I dieSee his face, see his smileTime to die
