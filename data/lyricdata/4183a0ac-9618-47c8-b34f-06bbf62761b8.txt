(Tennant/Lowe)Did you get what you want?Do you know what it is?Do you care?Is he better than me?Was it your place or his?Who was there?Did you think it was wrong?Do you find that it's worse than it was?Has it gone on too long?Do you mind that it hurts me?BecauseYou're breaking my heartI don't know what you wantbut I can't give it any moreI don't know what you wantbut I can't give it any moreYou're breaking my heartWas it cracking the codeor just filling in time?Was that all?So then why'd you go backto the scene of the crime?Did he call?Shall I take further blameor another assault on how it wasThen we'll get to the factthat it's always my fault justBecauseYou're breaking my heartI don't know what you wantbut I can't give it any moreI don't know what you wantbut I can't give it any moreYou're breaking my heartI don't know what you wantbut I can't give it any moreI don't know what you wantbut I can't give it any moreYou're breaking my heartDon't know what you wantDon't know what you want
