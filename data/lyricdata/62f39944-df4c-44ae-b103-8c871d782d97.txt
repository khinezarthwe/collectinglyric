Baby I've been a fool on timeBut it's always been in my wayAnd I don't know or understand it nowSo darlin' summer's almost goneAnd I've been cold and along my way everydayI'm calling out in overloadJust to save you for it's the only time we knowYesterday is so far and I can only begin to sayI've been winging it hereBut time's just a killing my dayYearning for to touch your waysNow any time you feel it insideDon't be lonely in your sleepDream me there cause it will always keep us boundIt's the same old laws that we learned on yesterdayIt's your way I'm calling outAnd how god has blessed meHow long this time will have our wayJust the same spring is gone and your summer's on its wayFeel it nowDon't worry what's going down'Cause everything we ever had is always here
