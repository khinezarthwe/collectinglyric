Sometimes this life gives you the ballBut you hand it to the other sideWhat kind of man have I becomeHave I bottled up and sold my prideWell you know me I ain't been goin' nowhereOn my slight hypocritical tripWell you know me I ain't goin' nowhereNo real need to flipWhen it slip slip slips right awayDown the hatchIt slip slip slips right awayAnd soon you don't rate meSometimes a girl shows you the ballAnd then passes to the other sideWhat kind of woman would do thatDid she get lost somewhere down the lineWell I know her she ain't goin nowhereOn her weak metaphysical kickWell I know her she ain't goin' nowhereI've no need to tripWhen it slip slip slips right awayDown the hatchIt slip slip slips right awayAnd soon you don't rate meAnd I don't rate youSometimes this life gives you a signBut you're struck temporarily blindWhat kind of man have I becomeHave I given up and lost my mindWell you know me I ain't goin' nowhereOn my slight hypocritical tripWell you know me I ain't been goin' nowhereSo don't give me no lipWhen it slip slip slips right awayDown the hatchIt slip slip slips right awayAnd soon you don't rate meBut I won't hate youI'll just remember how I used to make you laughI can remember how I used to make you laughYou see the long train runnin'Whistle's blown just to make you feel lonely and sadIf you ain't believin' you better start retreatingOr soon you'll be a bleedin'Go ask yer dad
