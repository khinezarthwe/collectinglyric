Thought I ran into you down on the streetThen it turned out to only be a dreamI made a point to burn all of the photographsShe went away and then I took a different pathI remember the face but I can't recall the nameNow I wonder how Whatsername has beenSeems that she disappeared without a traceDid she ever marry old Whatshisface?I made a point to burn all of the photographsShe went away and then I took a different pathI remember the face but I can't recall the nameNow I wonder how Whatsername has beenRemember whateverIt seems like forever agoRemember whateverIt seems like forever agoThe regrets are useless in my mindShe's in my head, I must confessThe regrets are useless in my mindShe's in my head from so long ago, go, go, goAnd in the darkest nightIf my memory serves me rightI'll never turn back timeForgetting you but not the time
