When I first saw you, there were gods in the riverBlack birds were warningCircling high above the marquee whereBold are the loversMessed with the holiness othersTurned our breath into snowflakesWhispered the night wishWe try to find the life at rainbow's endIt finds the end of us insteadEveryone we loveWhen I come back nowThere are etched, shattered diamonds in the skylineYou can't afford to look up at them allCatch your reflection in someone else's mirrorYour voice in the musicYou're drowning in a silent prayerSo if I dive over the railingWill I float up on all the shining waves of lightWe try to find the life at rainbow's endIt finds the end of us insteadEveryone we love's aroundEveryone we love's aroundEverywhere, we seeCome onEveryone we loveEveryone we loveEveryone we loveEveryone we loveEveryone you love surrounds youEveryone you love surrounds youEveryone you love surrounds youEveryone you loveEveryone you love surroundsEveryone you love surroundsEveryone you love surrounds
