I wish that we could talk about itBut there, that's the problemWith someone new I could have startedToo late for beginningsThe very little things that made me nervousAre gone in a momentI miss the way we used to argueLocked in your basementI wake up and the phone is ringingSurprised, as it's earlyAnd that should be your perfect warningThat something's a problemTo tell the truth I saw it comingThe way you were breathingBut nothing can prepare you for itThe voice on the other endThe worst is all the lovely weatherI'm sad, it's not rainingThe coffee isn't even bitterBecause, what's the difference?There's all the work that needs to be doneIt's late for revisionThere's all the time and all the planningAnd songs to be finishedAnd it keeps comingAnd it keeps comingAnd it keeps comingTill the day, it stopsAnd it keeps comingAnd it keeps comingAnd it keeps comingTill the day, it stopsAnd it keeps comingAnd it keeps comingAnd it keeps comingTill the day, it stopsAnd it keeps comingAnd it keeps comingAnd it keeps comingAnd it keeps comingAnd it keeps comingAnd it keeps comingAnd it keeps comingTill the day, it stopsI wish that we could talk about itBut there, that's the problemWith someone new I couldn't start itToo late for beginningsYou're smaller than my wife imaginedSurprised you were humanThere shouldn't be this radio silenceBut what are the options?When someone great is goneWhen someone great is goneWhen someone great is goneWhen someone great is goneWhen someone great is goneWhen someone great is goneWhen someone great is goneWhen someone great is goneWe're safe for the momentSaved for the moment
