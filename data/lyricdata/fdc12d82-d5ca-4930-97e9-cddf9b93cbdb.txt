Don't remember where I wasI realized life was a gameThe more seriously I took thingsThe harder the rules becameI had no idea what it'd costMy life passed before my eyesI found out how little I accomplishedAll my plans deniedSo as you read this, know my friendsI'd love to stay with you allSmile when you think of meMy body's gone, that's allThese are the last wordsI'll ever speakAnd they'll set me freeIf my heart was still aliveI know it would surely breakAnd my memories left with youThere's nothing more to sayMoving on is a simple thingWhat it leaves behind is hardYou know the sleeping feel no more painAnd the living, all are scarredThese are the last wordsI'll ever speakAnd they'll set me freeSo as you read, know, my friendsI'd love to stay with you allPlease, smile, smile when you think about meMy body's gone, that's allThese are the last wordsI'll ever speakAnd they'll set me freeThese are the last wordsI'll ever speakAnd they'll set me free
