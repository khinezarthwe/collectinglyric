Yes it's true that I believeI'm weaker than I used to beI wear my heart out on my sleeveAnd I forget the rest of meYes there's times I've been afraidAnd there's no harm in that I prayCuz I'm more frightened everydaySomeone will take the hope I have awayChorusBut you gotta give it upTo get off sometimesYou gotta give it upTo get off sometimesYou gotta give it upTo get get off sometimes I knowAll the times I've given inYou fit me like a second skinAnd one by one I will beginTo wear you on the days I'm feeling thin(Chorus)You'd better stop, stop, stopUsing me upYou'd better stopCuz I've had enoughAnd I'm ready to forget the reasonsThat keep me hereOooooo walkIn the rainYou will even if you're never gonna changeGood God, need a little love whileYou find what you think you're gonna be, child
