Do you believe in the sands of timeTo bring it back in reverse, rewindYes, I believe in the sands of time'Cause now they got me feelin' like the world is mineIs there a need in life for something clearerA sudden urge to reach beyond the mirrorI'll (be) there when the darkness of the yearI'm sure invades in the place we came to fearSo we were once from a world divineNow we proceed toward the end of timeAs we were once in a place sublimeNow we will see the final tideDo you believe in the sands of timeTo bring it back in reverse, rewindYes, I believe in the sands of time'Cause now they got me feelin' like the world is mineOr could it be the time for something realAnother one of the forces that we feelAs you destroy the world we safely weildSo we were once from a world divineNow we proceed toward the end of timeAs we were once in a place sublimeNow we will see the final tideDo you believe in the sands of timeTo bring it back in reverse, rewindYes, I believe in the sands of time'Cause now they got me feelin' like the world is mineDo you believe in the Hand of TimeDo you believe that it makes the things go 'roundWith intent to increase the mind no doubtWaves spread the love throughoutWere we born to make an engine loudOr were we brought here to die
