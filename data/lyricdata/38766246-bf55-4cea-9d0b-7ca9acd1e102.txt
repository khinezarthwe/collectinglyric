Time, time on your mindA conscience tickingImages passing by like picture slides arrangedLove will surviveIt twists and turns youA circuit inside your head reminds you that it's fineI miss you more than words can sayA part of me has torn awayA china heart will always breakA fracture to a twisted faceBut things are gonna heal againEyes once blind will see againI miss you more than words can sayI miss you more than words .....Quick fadeTry, learning to flyReach new skyFind a new place to be and watch life pass you byTry to get highJumped so you could feel it...You're living inside a dreamAs waterfalls surroundI miss you more than words can sayA part of me is torn awayChina hearts will always breakA fracture to a twisted faceBut things are gonna heal againEyes once blind will see againI miss you more than words can sayI miss you more than words .....Quick fade...fade, fade, fade...Glide, Glide over tidesAnd waves that pull youOceans divide us once and bring you home againLove will surviveIt twists and turns youHe's gone, gone, Quick fadeIts gone, gone, Quick fade...I miss you more than words can sayA part of me is torn awayChina hearts will always breakA fracture to a twisted faceBut things are gonna heal againEyes once blind will see againI miss you more than words can sayI miss you more than words .....Quick fade
