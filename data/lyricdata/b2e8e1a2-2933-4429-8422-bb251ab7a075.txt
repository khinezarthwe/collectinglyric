Now I see his face, I see his smileSuch a lonely place, no golden mileEyes tell of morbid tales of his black heartHis deeds through ages past tell of his partSee his face, see his smileTime to dieAngel from below, change my dreamsI want for glory's hour, for wealth's esteemI wish to sell my soul, to be rebornI wish for earthly riches, don't want no crown of thornsSee his face, see his smileTime to dieI was born a fool, don't want to stay that wayDevil take my soul, with diamonds you repayI don't care for heaven, so don't you look for me to cryAnd I will burn in hell, from the day I dieSee his face, see his smileTime to die
