I've got a little secret for yaEven now there's something to be proud aboutYou'll come up the hard way and they'll remind you every day:"You're nothing"Oh, my words in your mouth are mumbled all aboutYou're like a, a journalist, how you can cut and paste and twist:You're awfulTell it to your kingTell him everything you knowTell him you know how I feelTell him you know how I feel at the palace gatesOh, I'm all levered off my faceAnd just to work out what he's on aboutAnd see snakes in eyes and danger signsIf you were late, you mustn't dare complainOh, you won't like this at allThere's nothing to break your fallOh, tell it to your kingTell him everything you knowAnd you know how I feel out of placeUntil I'm levered off my faceAnd I can't work out what you're on aboutDidn't they explainYou have to play the game, ohHe drinks and smokes his cares awayHis heart is in the lonely wayLiving in the ruinsOf a castle built on sand
