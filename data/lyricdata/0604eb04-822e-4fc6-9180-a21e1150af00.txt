Calm those vowels downNo-one's thinking of you right now.She's dressed up - It's her duty to the town.It's empty. It's vast.But it imposes it's will.In a crowded roomHer painted features smothered in the gloom -Already resignedAt night she scrapesAway the face that she createsThe mirror sighs...Why can't we always meetUnder a cloud of mystery?The noise from a hundred mouthsWorking through memoryBig budget, Showbiz exit -She'll go far.Acting coy was her favourite ployIt quickly loses its charm.The frosted cheek you turnedWill add to your mystiqueHe burns for you.I threw myself into your worldOnly to come up short...Why can't we always meetUnder a cloud of mystery?The noise from a hundred mouthsWorking through memoryKing for a Thursday afternoonBefore the time when you withdrewWhy can't we always meetUnder a cloud of mystery?Bathroom lights stud the eveningWhere the buildings skim the airHairsprayed curls push the cheekAs they swoon on a wooden dance floorThere's nothing worse than taking a chanceOn an outdated dance...Why can't we always meetUnder a cloud of mystery?The noise from a hundred mouthsCursing through memoryKing for a Thursday afternoonBefore the time when you withdrewWhy can't we always meetUnder a cloud of mystery?
