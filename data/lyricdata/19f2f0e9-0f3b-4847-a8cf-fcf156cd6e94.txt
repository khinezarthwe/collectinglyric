LoveI get so lost sometimesDays passAnd this emptiness fills my heartWhen I want to run awayI drive off in my carBut whichever way I goI come back to the place you areAll my instinctsThey returnThe grand façadeSo soon will burnWithout a noiseWithout my prideI reach out from the insideIn your eyesThe light, the heatI am completeI see the doorwayTo a thousand churchesThe resolutionOf all the fruitless searchesOh, I see the light and the heatOh, I want to be that completeI want to touch the light, the heat I see in your eyesLoveI don't like to see so much painSo much wastedAnd this moment keeps slipping awayI get so tiredWorking so hard for our survivalI look to the time with youTo keep me awake and aliveAnd all my instinctsThey returnAnd the grand façadeSo soon will burnWithout a noiseWithout my prideI reach out from the insideIn your eyesIn your eyesIn your eyesThe light, the heatI am completeI see the doorwayTo a thousand churchesThe resolutionOf all the fruitless searchesOh, I see the light and the heatOh, I want to be that completeI want to touch the light, the heat I see in your eyesIn your eyes, in your eyesIn your eyes, in your eyesIn your eyes, in your eyes
