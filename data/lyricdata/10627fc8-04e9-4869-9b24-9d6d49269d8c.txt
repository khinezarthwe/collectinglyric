I've tried to balance these lives that we are livingYou always feel justified but you never feel forgivingI woke up one morning to find myself wrapped in the things I swore I'd never touchAnd here I am again trying to save what's left of you and ISo why aren't you satisfied?I reached outFell shortNow you're hurtToo many wordsBreaking the silenceI felt itBled itScreamed itIt only gets worseAnd it kills me what's in me is too angry for us to surviveI used too many words tonightI tried to get it rightBut I was just wastin' my time'Cause you never compromised when it came to our livesWe struggle and fall apart, we build it back to static startThe endless accusations, I can't believe we made it this farI reached outFell shortNow you're hurtToo many wordsBreaking the silenceI felt itBled itScreamed itIt only gets worseAnd it kills me what's in me is too angry for us to surviveI used too many words tonightWaking alone tomorrow has gotta be better than thisI reached outFell shortNow you're hurtToo many wordsBreaking the silenceI felt itBled itScreamed itIt only gets worseI used too many words tonightToo many wordsToo many wordsToo many wordsToo many words
