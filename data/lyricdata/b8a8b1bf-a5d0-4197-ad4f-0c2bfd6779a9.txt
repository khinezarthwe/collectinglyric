Sometimes I can see for milesThrough water and fireFrom England toI feel life meet my eyesAnd it's the best thingIt's the best thingIt's the best thingA beautiful feelingA smile from San DiegoHe is still a boyTwo ends to every rainbowAnd a train from MexicoAnd he's the best thingHe's the best thingHe's the best thingA beautiful feelingAnd when I watch you moveAnd I can't think straightAnd I am silencedAnd I can't think straightAnd it's the best thingIt's the best thingThe best thingSuch a beautiful feeling
