Lonely boy, where do we goI'm stuck believing in the other sideStuck on my ownRun fast, you're dreamingNo place to hideSafety in things I'm dumb for thinking'Cuz a piece of plasticIs nothing more than a piece of plasticEmpty streets under my feetHow did we get so far?From the general beatAcross that greatHeld fast together in the dying dayOh you are swimming inside the magic hourOh and when you wet your skinYou can suck up all you need to knowYou can suck up all you need to know, oh ohPicture me, how will you picture me when I am dead?All fast and free, building a fantasy with blocks in my headA legacy, do these things dissipate in the years unread?I've got a pain just like a knife, and the time has left meOh I'm just trying to do my bestI'm not afraid of life, I'm afraid of deathBuild my love in the things I sayYou've gotta lift your face to the breaking dayOh I'm just trying to do my bestI'm not afraid of life, I'm afraid of deathBuild my love in the things I sayYou've gotta lift your face to the breaking daySo I ran and I jumped and I flew 'til I came to the center of the Earth so coldAnd the wind picked me up and took me straight into the belly of the fears I holdAnd I ran and I ran and I ran and I ranAnd then I came right backThrew my arms around youYou were dressed in blackI'm so glad I found youFor you burned my stuffObjects all around meDo we outlast thingsMemories astound meDo we fade like thisKeep your body down to the groundThe flesh and the soil that we love so muchI always wanted to returnReturn to the body where I was bornI always wanted to returnAnd I ran and I ran and I ranSo far I'm just trying to do my bestI'm not afraid of life, I'm afraid of deathBuild my love in the things I sayYou've gotta lift your face to the breaking dayAnd I'm just trying to do my bestI'm not afraid of life, I'm afraid of deathBuild my love in the things i sayYou've gotta lift your face to the breaking dayBecause in time it leaves youIt leaves you like blood, red bloodIt leaves you like blood, red bloodIt leaves you like blood, red bloodIt leaves you like blood, red blood
