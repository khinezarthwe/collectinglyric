I am a point in the skyA star in a constellationI'm all you seeI am Orion's eyesA towering giant's sightMe being of mammoth sizeThis comes as no surprise, surpriseI see all I've createdFrom my colossus stanceI watch as my investmentIs swarmed by the busy antsThey'll carry ten times the weightIf it means landing the dealThey'll eat what's not on their plateIf it means a full mealShine down on us nowWash our hands cleanLord knows they're filthyBlackened with greedPlease be our saviorGreat deityWell if you can't save usCan this money?I see all I've createdFrom my colossus stanceI watch as my investmentIs swarmed by the busy antsThey'll carry ten times the weightIf it means landing the dealThey'll eat what's not on their plateIf it means a full mealFew have cut their stringsAnd risked it all to chase their dreamsMost seek the quick buckThe perfect tanThe easy fuckPray for their promotionThey stay in lineThey please the queenThey wait their turnClimb the hillAt all costs, avoid the painWith my titan feet I couldEnd it with just one stepYou cannot dodge agonyIf all ten tons of itComes stomping down on you at onceLike a bullet to the brainFrom my monster heightA healthy walk I contemplateI see all I've createdFrom my colossus stanceI watch as my investmentIs swarmed by the busy antsThey'll carry ten times the weightIf it means landing the dealThey'll eat what's not on their plateIf it means a full meal
