Along deserted avenuesSteam begins to riseThe figures primed and readyPrepared for quick surpriseHe's watching for a signHis life is on the lineSworn to avengeCondemned to HellTempt not the bladeAll fear the SentinelDogs whine in the alleysSmoke is on the windFrom deep inside its empty shellA cathedral bell beginsRinging out its tollA storm begins to growSworn to avengeCondemned to HellTempt not the bladeAll fear the SentinelAmidst the upturned burned-out carsThe challengers awaitAnd in their fists clutch iron barsWith which to seal his fateAcross his chest in scabbards restThe rows of throwing knivesWhose razor points in challenged testsHave finished many livesNow facing one anotherThe stand-off eats at timeThen all at once a silence fallsAs the bell ceases its chimeUpon this sign, the challengersWith shrieks and cries rush forthThe knives fly out like bulletsUpon their deadly courseScreams of pain and agonyRend the silent airAmidst the dying bodiesBlood runs everywhereThe figure stands expressionlessImpassive and aloneUnmoved by this victoryAnd the seeds of death he's sownSworn to avengeCondemned to HellTempt not the bladeAll fear the SentinelSworn to avengeCondemned to HellTempt not the bladeAll fear the SentinelSworn to avengeCondemned to HellTempt not the bladeAll fear the SentinelSworn to avengeCondemned to HellTempt not the bladeAll fear the Sentinel
