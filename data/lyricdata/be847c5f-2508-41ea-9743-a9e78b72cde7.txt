OhOhOhOhI was on my way to the center of the sunWhen I lost my wings and I fell into a crowdAnd they carried me to a hole in the groundAnd they buried meWhere no one could seeAnd no one would be aroundI, I am a virus, II, I live in silence, IMmmI was on my way to a city in the cloudsWhen I lost my mind and I had to settle downThen I had a dream of an island in the seaWhere the lepers dieWhere no one survivesAnd no one can hear the criesI, I am a virus, II, I live in silence, IAnd just like heathens thinking on our feetWe believe in GodAnd with one step, two stepsThree steps toward the graveyardOn the high road to rememberingIt seems that we forgotI am a virus, II, I live in silence, IEh, eh, eh
