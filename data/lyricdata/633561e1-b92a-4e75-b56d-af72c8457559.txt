Bound to say something, eyes closed,It's cold, and I'm homeI feel like nothing again,Pretending not to care, but I care,And I care, don't say another wordOur time was worthless and I triedWe started over and over again as we let goWe held each other, held handsHeld standards and grudgesThat's when I let you knowI guess that goes to showJust what I've been going throughMore nights of hugging my pillow, ohReplaying memories, pleaseSing a song for me;And tell me how you'll never leave my sideI'll meet you at 7I miss you alreadyGoodbye to youThe last goodbye I'll ever say to youOur time was worthless and I triedWe started over and over againAs we let goWe held each other, held handsHeld standards and grudgesThat's when I let you knowI guess that goes to showSing a song for meAnd tell me how you'll never leave my sideI'll meet you at 7I miss you alreadyGoodbye to youThe last goodbye I'll ever sayAnd I tried so hardAnd I've done my partAnd not to mention most to all of yoursTry and feelTry and listenTry and think of what you're missinTry and look into my eyesTryGoodbye.Sing a song for meAnd tell me how you'll never leave my sideI'll meet you at 7I miss you alreadyGoodbye to youThe last goodbye I'll ever to say to youReplaying memoriesYou'll never leave my side
