With hand on heart your right from the start,you taught me to take my part.No cross to bear, no reason to care, my life was all up in air,Four to the floor, I was sure, never seeing clear,I could have it all, whenever you are near.The iron hand did not understand the plight of the common man.Four to the floor I was sure, never seeing clear,I could have it all whenever you are near.Four to the floor I was sure, that you would be my girl,we'd rent a little world, have a little girl.Four to the floor I was sure, never seeing clear,I could have it all if only you were here.Four to the floor I was sure that you would be my girl,we'd rent a little world, have a little girl.Four to the floor I was sure never seeing clear,I could have it all whenever you are near.
