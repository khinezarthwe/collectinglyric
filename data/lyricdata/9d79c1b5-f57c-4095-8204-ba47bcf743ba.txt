And boys are so coldThey speak without meaningThe only time they talk is in their sleepAnd girls are a boreTheir touch without feelingTheir secrets always far too grim to keepAnd up until nowYou've lived in their shadows trying hard to please themBut they'll never changeAs long as there breathingThinking hurts and thoughts don't rhymeTo those of us who've never triedTo find a face behind our lipstick smilesAnd as our pretty faces dieOur broken hearts will wonder whyThe make-up just won't hide the scars of timeAnd boys are so cruelSo don't let them find you tonightAnd girls are so vainSo put them behind you tonightI'll cast you a spellA magic where everyone plays dead foreverAnd after tonight they'll never remind youThinking hurts And thoughts don't rhymeTo those of us who've never triedTo find a face behind our lipstick smilesAnd as our pretty faces dieOur broken hearts will wonder whyThe make-up just won't hide the scars of time
