Just before dawn comesSadness is onJust one more momentAnd I am leavingFew words on a small noteWhile you are asleepI can only steal awayThat's how I tend to beThere are things I never get to sayThe fear in me always in the wayA broken heart never mendedA hurt I can never forgetA little pearlLocked in a shellCan not explainEach breath I'm takingCan not find the means to an endTo move create one liberated momentBeauty hides in the deepBeauty hides in the deepBut it's so hard to findBeing wrapped up insideI always wonderWhy don't I feelWhat the world out there is likeAnd how I can fit inI don't expect you to know meOr how I lost all my dreamsWhen I can't even find myselfIn the choices I made[X2]I want you to knowI'll never forget you
