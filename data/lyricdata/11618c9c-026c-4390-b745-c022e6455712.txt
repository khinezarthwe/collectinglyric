I walk through deaths' doorI'm frightened to seeA determined fate is not in store for meNo light in the tunnelOr brimstone awaitsReturn to the earthA reincarnateMy lifeMeant others had to suffer in my wakeMy hatred proved too much for god to takeMy soul is set to live in disrespectKarmas' retribution - lifes' rejectIs what I'm meant to beAn outcast from society??A laughing stock - as I walk the earthVindication laughs at my rebirthOr will I be a victim of the thingCommonly known as eternity??Eternally blackIn limbo I'm trappedIn silence I sound a pleaLight is no moreI feel not a thingUndead, I need to break freeListenThe silence deafens all the unheard screamsThe darkness rips away all the unseen dreamsNumbmess shrouds my soul I'm left to roamParalysis now my only homeSpiritual planes do not existLife in this realm I will resistAnd break these bonds - These chains that lock my soulWatch my growing fire burst through the wallI need to grasp the earthen world againOnto the realm of humans I'll ascendHungerOf the undeadNow if my soul is mine then why will you not let it be free??I wonderWhen this will all endTo live in this shell makes me laugh at religious diseaseWho'd think thatThere's no hell or heaven??Only an abscence of god and no satan supposedly fellA spirits'ReincarnationIs the proof of no heaven or merciless torment of hell...I walk through lifes' doorI'm frightened to seeA determined fate is now in store for meA leper I standA pitiful sceneMartyred, by my impietyBelieve meThe vicious circle has triumphed againAnd now a life of agony I'll beginThe fates have dealt the hand I'm set to playA losing situation in every wayI know I'm meant to beAn outcast from societyAnd live my days banished from the raceReborn into this life of much disgraceMy soul is set to live in disrespectKarmas' retribution - lifes' reject!!!
