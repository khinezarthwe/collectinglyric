Every call you never madeEvery call you waited for, it never cameEvery ancient sound that's passed to your earsIn an endless supply of ones and zerosEvery sun you never sawEvery sun you said didn't make it at allOh, the futuristic landscape shaped like todayBut just a few days laterI can feel it as oneI can feel it in the thunderToo many words in a dayToo many words I don't want to forget to tell youI want to file it all awayWe'll write a tombstone as high as the bibleAnd every shred is fake, I'm afraidAnd every shred is copper-platedEvery shred you can keep your eyes onCheck me while I check the horizonI can feel it as oneI can feel it in the thunderHere's what we do, we learn you the rulesAnd if you get stuck you can throw them the fuck outEvery call you never madeEvery call you waited for, it never cameEvery ancient sound that's passed to your earsIn an endless supply of ones and zerosEvery sun you never sawEvery sun you said didn't make it at allOh, the futuristic landscape shaped like todayBut just a few days laterI can feel it as oneI can feel it in the thunder
