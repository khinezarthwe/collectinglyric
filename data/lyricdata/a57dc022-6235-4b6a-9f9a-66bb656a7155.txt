The man who sailed around his soulFrom East to West, from pole to poleWith ego as his drunken captainGreed, the mutineer, had trapped all reason in the holdThe man who walked across his heartWho took no compass, guide or chartTo rope and tar his blood congealedWhen he found his self revealed ugly and coldAnd the Sirens that singBy your nose with its ringThey'll drag you inFor your sinsNow he sits all aloneAnd it's no place like homeIt's empty skinA bag to keep life's souvenirs inThe man who sailed around his soulThe man who sailed around his soulThe man who sailed around his soulCame back again to find a holeWhere once he thought compassion and the truthHad laid to warm his freezing carcass on returnThe man who walked across his heartWas doomed to journey from the startOf every love affair he'd brokenAll the lies he'd ever spokenTattooed on his armAnd the jellyfish stingsEven angels with wingsWho look too deepAnd dare to peepNow he sits all aloneKnowing flesh blood and boneIs everythingHe found the treasure he'd been seekingThe man who sailed around his soul
