[Kim]Yr bounce to the ounce makes us wanna pounceYr just being totally perfectOn Larry King you said you were  tiredTime to put to bed yr competitive edgeThey say you can't say no to BrahmaNow you don't have to try so hardThe label says you don't have to wear less clothesIt's time to take a bubble bathChorus:Hey hey little baby breakdownButton up baby you come undoneHey hey little baby get downBefore you fall and hurt someoneYou say you need privacyBroken glass everywhereMaybe you need an emo boyNo underwear on the director's chairYou are seemingly unconsciousOf what yr body is doingLike Miss Monroe yr head don't knowExactly what yr body's doingChorusOn TV you're soft and whisperyDelicate like angel food cakeThey say if you press too hard on itIt will squish into a dense ballIt will lose its fluffinessThat's what you get when you use a box mixCan you get some satisfactionHow much are you willing to pay?ChorusWhat's yr gut feeling about the new dealHow's the label gonna remake you?How was yr date with EminemDid he bake you and then forsake youIs innocence gonna still overtake youLike Arthur Doyle they can't fake youOh Mariah you are endlessLike the wind, you feel defenselessChorus
