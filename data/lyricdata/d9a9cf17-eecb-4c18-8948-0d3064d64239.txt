HaI gotta tell yaI'll make it betterBut I know there's somethin' I needed to sayWhen I was out nowMaybe you were better aloneI know I'll make it homeShe told me sweet thangRun a labourIn your shoesTouch me till I follow in loveI wanna help herMaybe we were better aloneI wanna show you howAnd then we walked outMake it made nowI said I want it but I never aloneI wanna show youMaybe we were somethin' uncoolI'm gonna make you singUh oh, ohOhOh, oh, oh, ooh
