I dreamed of you on my farmI dreamed of you in my armsBut dreams are always wrongI never dreamed I'd hurt youI never dreamed I'd lose youIn my dreams I'm always strongBut now the creek is risingAnd all my bridges burnedI always dreamed of big crowdsPlumes of smoke and high cloudsBut dreams don't last for longI have my suspicionsWhen the stars are in positionAll will be revealedBut I know that until thenUnless the stars surrenderAll wll be concealedAnd now the snow is fallingAnd all my fences tornI know you need someoneAnd I can hear someoneSomewhere in this songI dreamed that I was walkingand the two of us were talkingOf all life's mysteryThe words that flow between friendsWinding streams without endI wanted you to seeBut it can seem surprisingWhen you find yourself aloneAnd now the dark is risingAnd a brand new moon is bornI always dreamed I'd love youI never dreamed I'd lose youIn my dreams I'm always strong
