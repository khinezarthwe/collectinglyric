On a short trip we made a landingThen we were strangers in townHow they stared as we made our exitWe're white they're all brownDr. Livingstone where are you whenwe need you the mostWe're white as ivory on the ivory coast[1/2CHORUS]Jet into jetEat their poison like true ambassadorsWe will drink up their beerSo predictable washed out whiteMen foreigners are hereCall me master I'll call you boyIf that's all that you needHow that wounds me just leave me hereto bleed[SOLO]Black mans burden is on his shoulderand keeps him well in his placeTwo hundred pounds worth ofmegawattsThat smack him in the faceThere's no reason to take the weightLife's not strapped to your headDon't wear the token till the token blackis dead[CHORUS]
