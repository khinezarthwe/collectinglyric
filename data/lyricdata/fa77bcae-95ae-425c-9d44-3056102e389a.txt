There's something about youThat reminds me of all those timesWhen I wasn't sorry, when I wasn't blueThe cherry moon it shone down on usUnder the stars shining down every one for youIf I could count them allI would circle the moonAnd count 'em back to nothingTil I got to youSomething in you dies, when it's overEverybody cries sometimesIf loving you's a dreamThat's not worth havingThen why do I dream of you?I used to be the house that you lived inDown on Meadowlake StreetWhen you moved they cut down the maple treeI carved your name intoThe tree became a boat, I christened it your nameAnd when the water turned to saltFrom your tears it hit the bottom of the oceanWhere I go when I hear your nameAnd I sink like a stoneSomething in you dies, when it's overEverybody cries sometimesIf loving you's a dreamThat's not worth havingThen why do I dream of you?Why do I dream of you?I feel like a dream that's not worthhavingLike a nervous joke ain't nobody laughingLike somebody with nothing 'cause they don't knowWhat they're wantingTiny like the sand in the cracks of drift woodWashed up on the shore of an ocean of youBoats out on the horizonMade of the maple tree where we used to lie downOn Meadowlake Street counting the stars you and IYou and ISomething in you dies when it's overEverybody cries sometimesIf loving you's a dream that's not worth havingThen why do I dream of you?Why do I dream of you?...Why?
