I remember nights out when we were youngThey weren't very good they were rubbishRunning round Highroyds isn't funJust teenagers testing their courageStanding outside nightclubs in the snowUs not very cool or impressiveThey let in all the girls from the year belowNo need for ID's with those dressesGot news from afarFrom a girl who knows who we areShe's still got my dinner moneyShe can keep itNever had a fight that we haven't lostNot very tough or athleticOnce I had a boxing champ in a headlockWhen he gets out I'll regret itGot keys to a carPicked up a girl from Boston SpaFor fast food and cinemaIt's not worth itGot word from down southWell he had heard about it word of mouthHaven't much stayed in touchSince HighroydsLet it go and let it goAnd if I'm wrong then I won't knowCos no one's gonna tell me but a friendHe has gone and Ian's goneAnd everybody went alongAnd nobody was left here in the endGot news from Uncle HughThrough a second cousin once removedToo late there's a housing estateIt's called HighroydsGot a text from an exShe wants to know when we're in London next"And will you write a song about me?"I don't think so
