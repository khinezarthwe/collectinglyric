I spent all day trying to decideAbout the things that you said last nightDid they mean nothing or were they filled with hidden clues?And can you really have stayed 'til three?Orange slices and that Fall LPI feel so lonely when I get back from seeing youAnd when someone brings up your nameI can feel myself begin to changeIt's like a panic and a rushing sound in my headA huge weight pressing on my chestAnd now I spend hours trying to look my bestBut I still meet you the day before I wash my hairOh won't you put that down and take me, I'm yoursWhen will we have this chance again?Oh please just put that down and take me, I'm yoursWe might never have this chance againThat must have been a knowing lookOh when you moved to pass your friend his bookAnd oh that feeling when your hand returns to mineI think I might as well stay out hereOh but can you kiss me just once properlyWell of course I mean it, I think about you all the timeOh won't you put that down and take me, I'm yoursWhen will we have this chance again?Oh please just put that down and take me, I'm yoursWe might never have romance againWarm hands and things you sayYou get lovelier every dayWarm hands and things you sayYou get lovelier every day, oh!
