[Altus/White]There's got to be a solutionThere must be a cureSomething to get me through this confusionWhat will it take to set me free?The time that's passed is full of frustrationSo much to tell, but no words to sayI've suffered enough and my dues are paidNo turning back nowI'm on my wayWhen I look back I seeA time of miseryAt times it seemed that it would never end[Chorus:]Life is a gambleNo matter how you play the gameRoll the dice and take your chancesWin or lose it doesn't matter'Cause there's no escapeWhen you're a prisoner of fateAnything is possibleBut nothing is ever really sureNot always knowing what's wrong or rightYour only choice is to decideI stand alone in the pouring rainI just had to sayCapture the moment before it's goneYou've got the strength to carry onI was condemned to feelThis pain that's so unrealThe chains that bind me are behind me know[Repeat Chorus]Once I was lost in the abyssNo longer could I go on like this[Repeat Chorus]Prisoners of fate [4x]
