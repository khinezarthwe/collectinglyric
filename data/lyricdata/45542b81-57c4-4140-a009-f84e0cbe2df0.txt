The city feels clean this time of nightJust empty streets and me walking homeTo clear my headI know it came as no surpriseI'm affected more than I had guessedBy what was saidIf this loves not meant to beIf a hearts not ready to openIf the naked eye won't seeIt's broken.It's a quiet time before the dawnAnd I'm half past making sense of itWas I wrong?Should I think to give it all?In a world where not much ever seemsTo last long.If this loves not meant to beIf a hearts not ready to openIf the naked eye won't seeIt's broken.
