"I'm really okay, thanks, there's nothing to witness"I said as I looked back from the edge of the cliffThe old man looking down lent over the ridgeStruck with a grin as if a blessing had hit himI slumped on the jut of the cliff"Just leave me alone, this is none of your business""I will, said the old man, "but just one thing"And what he said was so lovely it stunned meHe said, "I lay right there once at the edge of the rockI was ready to jump, I was ever so lostBut this gentleman stopped and said something I never forgot"For billions of years since the outset of timeEvery single one of your ancestors survivedEvery single person on your mum and dad's sideSuccessfully looked after and passed on to you lifeWhat are the chances of that like?It comes to me once in a whileAnd everywhere I tell folk, it gets the best smileAnd then the old man walked away and out of sightTill the sound of him hiking turned to the sound of silenceI just froze in a profound surpriseAnd from down on my pride, I found a smile to my eyesAnd for many days again, I've been passing the same cliffAnd on many occasions, I'd chance on the same thingLaying in the moss in the same way I wasWould be another man looking like he needed a change of luckSo I'd say, "I lay right there once at the edge of the rockI was ready to jump, I was ever so lostBut this gentleman stopped and said something I never forgot"For billions of years since the outset of timeEvery single one of your ancestors survivedEvery single person on your mum and dad's sideSuccessfully looked after and passed on to you lifeWhat are the chances of that like?It comes to me once in a whileAnd everywhere I tell folk, it gets the best smileFor billions of years since the outset of timeEvery single one of your ancestors survivedEvery single person on your mum and dad's sideSuccessfully looked after and passed on to you lifeWhat are the chances of that like?It comes to me once in a whileAnd everywhere I tell folk, it gets the best smile
