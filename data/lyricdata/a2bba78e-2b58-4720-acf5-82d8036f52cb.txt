I'd swim across Lake MichiganI'd sell my shoesI'd give my body to be back againIn the rest of the roomTo be alone with youTo be alone with youTo be alone with youTo be alone with youYou gave your body to the lonelyThey took your clothesYou gave up a wife and a familyYou gave your ghostTo be alone with meTo be alone with meTo be alone with meAnd went up on a treeTo be alone with me and went up on the treeI've never known a man who loved me
