Two simple placeswe wanted to go.Two simple thingsyou wanted to know.Everything around,I couldn't see.I wish I'd knownhow much you loved me.Oh, we could feel this way forever (2X)I watch the sunas it it touches you while you sleep.You gave me somethingthat I wanted to keep.I see you smile you smile like a little child;and hold you crying when it all goes wild.Oh, we could feel this way forever.
