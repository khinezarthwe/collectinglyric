Drunk skinhead with an attitudeDoing circles like a shark with his foodIf someone tries to turn the other cheekHe disappears in a yellow streakAnimosity!The only world I know is drowning in rageI'm underwater from my dreams to the stageAnd any language that you learn to speakLove is listed and defined as weakAnimosity!Animosity and common hateFeeds the hungry on an empty plateA bitter taste and the promise of painFills you up while the soul is drained!Animosity!Animositisomina (repeat)
