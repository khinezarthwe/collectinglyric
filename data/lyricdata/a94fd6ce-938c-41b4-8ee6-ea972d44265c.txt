I wander lonely streetsBehind where the old Thames does flowAnd in every face I meetReminds me of what I have run forIn every man, in every handIn every kiss you understandThat living is for other menI hope you too will understandI've gotta tell you my taleOf how I loved and how I failedI hope you understandOh, these feelings should not be in the manIn every child, in every eyeIn every sky above my headI hope that I knowSo come with me in bedBecause it's you and me, we're historyThere ain't nothing left to sayWhen I will get you aloneMaybe we could find a roomWhere we could see what we should doMaybe you know it's trueLiving with me's like keeping a foolIn every man, in every handIn every kiss you understandThat living is for other menI hope you know that I am meSo come on, I'm thinking about historyAnd I'm living for historyAnd I think you know about meCause I amAnd one and one is twoBut three is companyWhen you're thinking about the things you doAnd you're thinking about the things you doI wanna tell you my taleAnd how I failed in love and jumped out on my bailDo you understand?There's more in a smile than in a handIn every sky, in every kissThere's one thing that you might have missedAnd why am I going toA place that now belongs to youBut you were weak and so am ILet's make it up, let's even tryTo live today, so why not smile?Don't dream away your lifeCause it is mine, it is mineIs that a crime?Is that a crime?This life is mineBut the bed ain't madeIt's filled full of hopeI've got a skin full of dopeOh, the bed ain't madeBut it's filled full of hopeI've got a skin full of dope
