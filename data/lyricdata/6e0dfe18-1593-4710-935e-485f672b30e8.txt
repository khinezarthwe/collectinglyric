Cut cut pastePays to fish from theHole I cut in your ceilingWhile you were sleepingDreaming of paisley pig in classy digsMy hook catches on your lipAnd I reel you inAnd as you rise up to my floorThe hook impairs our two tonguesAnd thats how we first kissIts something I still missYou think I've lost my mindIs this blood his or mine?'Cause when we kiss our scars alignAs a trail of bloodDrips for both our chinsYou awake in my living roomTo see it's stained your moccasinsYou cry out and askWhere you are and who am IAnd I tell you, I need youBut you run and jump back down the holeAnd thats how we first kissIts something I still miss
