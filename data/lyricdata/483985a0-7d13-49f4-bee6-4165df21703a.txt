Well, it's about timeIt's beginning to hurtTime you made up your mindJust what is it all worthAll my useless adviceAll my hanging aroundAll your cutting down to sizeAll my bringing you downWatch the clock on the wallFeel the slowing of timeHear a voice in the hallEchoing in my mindAll your stupid idealsYou've got your head in the cloudsYou should see how it feelsWith your feet on the groundHere I stand the accusedWith your fist in my faceFeeling tired and bruisedWith the bitterest tasteAll my useless adviceAll my hanging aroundAll your cutting down to sizeAll my bringing you downAll your stupid idealsYou've got your head in the cloudsYou should see how it feelsWith your feet on the ground
