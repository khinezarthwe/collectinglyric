I'm so tiredAll walled upI can taste the winterI would shut up if I thought that it matteredThat's what it feels likeWhen your stitched into this skinI feel stuckAnd no one thinks something's missingSomething's missingNo one caresNo one listensScreaming wordsThat you fake hearingNo one caresNo one listens anymore (no one listens anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore)My eyes burnAs I bury how I'm feelingClose my eyes, it's my life that I've been stealingIf it's all rightWhy do I feel a sense of longing?I had it allAnd yet I thought that something's missingSomething's missingNo one caresNo one listensScreaming wordsThat you fake hearingNo one caresNo one listens anymoreNo one caresNo one listensScreaming wordsThat you fake hearingNo one caresNo one listens anymoreSo paranoidI've been hiding from the sunI'm tired of being afraid of everythingAnd everyoneI'm so tiredNo one caresNo one listensScreaming wordsThat you fake hearingNo one caresNo one listens anymoreNo one caresNo one listensScreaming wordsThat you fake hearingNo one caresNo one listens anymoreNo one caresNo one listensScreaming wordsThat you fake hearingNo one caresNo one listens anymore
