Oh, September girl, I am so scared today.Already 28 and still haven't saved the world.Woke up this morning to nothing I recognized.Everything changed and I never saw it coming.Now there are 5 billion disappointed soulsscrapping around in my disappointed mind.And for the first time in my lifeI am afraid of changing because everything's changing without me.Oh September girl I am so scared for you.You finally decided to live on without me.Now I am forced to just swallow this heartfor you to become the girl you already are.Now there are five billion disappointed soulsthat'll just have to wait' 'cause I only dream for you.Maybe it's time for me to do. The thing that I meant to do.'Cause your getting older and I'm getting older and even us good people die.The gifted never stop seeing the world for the first time.The good ones grow older, the poor ones grow older,the great ones are never forgotten.
