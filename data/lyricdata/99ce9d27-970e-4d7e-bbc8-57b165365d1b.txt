Girls,I know you will understand thisand feel the intrinsic incredible emotionYou have just pulled over your head the worn,warm sweater belonging to a boyNow, you haven't had a passionate kissing session or anything,but you got to go on a camping trip with himand eight other people from schoolAnd you practically slept together,your sleeping bag right next to hisAnd you woke in the night to watch him as he sleptbut you couldn't see anything 'cause it was darkso you just laid there and listened to his breathingand wondered if your heart might burstThe sweater has that slightly goat-like smellwhich all teenage boys possess,and that smell will lovingly transferto all your other clothesIf you get to keep it for a few days you can sleep with itbut don't let your mom see, 'cause she'll say,"what is that filthy thing, and who does it belong tobesides the trash man?"So you have to keep it under the covers with youYou can kind of lie it beside you,or wrap it around your waist,or touch it on your legs, or whateverThat's your businessNow if the sweater has, like, reindeer on itor is a funny color like yellow... I'm sorry,you can't get away with a sweater like thatLook for brown, or grey, or blueAnything other than that, and you know you're dealing withsomeone who's differentAnd different is NOT what you're looking forYou're looking for those Alpine ski-chiseled featuresand that sort of blank look which passes for deep thoughtor at least the notion that someone's homeYou're looking for the boy of your dreamswho is the same boy in the dreams of all your friendsNow the sweater isn't going to fit you of course,you have to kinda roll up the sleeves in a jaunty waySaying "this is the sweater belonging to a boy andthe boy is a genuine hunka-hunka burning love andis not just some hand-me-down from yourbrother or father"Monday, wear the sweater to schoolBe calm, look cuteDon't tell him about the dream you hadabout the place the two of you would sharewhen you get olderJust be yourselfThe best, cutest, quietest version of yourselfDefinitely wear lip glossHe looks at you, and then he looks awayAnd then he walks awayand the smell of the sweater hits you again suddenlylike ape-scent gloriolaand you get a note passed to youby a girl in History that says"He needs that sweater back.He forgot you put it on in the tent on Saturdayand he's been looking for it."And you don't have to die of humiliation, you knowYou are a strong personand this is a learning experienceYou can still hold your head up high as you run from the classroomtearing the stinking sweater from your body.You look at that sweatercarefullyand you realize that love made you temporarely blind.You've got a secret now, honey,and though you'd never sink as low as him,you could blab it all over the school if you wantedThe label in that sweatersaid "100% Acrylic"
