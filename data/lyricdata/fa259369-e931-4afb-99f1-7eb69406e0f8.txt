Intro one: (not included on 7)When I was little... my father was famous.He was the greatest sam-urai in the empire;And he was the shogun's decapitator.He cut off the heads of a hundred and thirty-one lords.It was a bad time for the empire.The shogun just stayed inside his castle -- and he never came out.People said his brain was infected by devils.My father would come home -- he would forget about the killings.He wasn't scared of the shogun, but the shogun was scared of him.Maybe that was the problem.Then, one night... the shogun sent his ninja spies to our house.They were supposed to kill my father... but they didn't.*woman screams*That was the night everything changed *voice fades*Intro two: rzaSee, sometimes...You gotta flash em backSee niggaz don't know where this shit startedY'all know where it came fromI'm sayin we gonna take y'all back to the sourceWe bounce, yoChorus: rza, gzaWhen the mc's came, to live our their nameAnd to perform (forrrrm)Some had, to snort cocaine (caiiinnne) to act insane (sannne)With before pete rock-ed it on, now goneThat the mental plane (plaaanne) to spark the brain (brainnn)With the building to be bornYo rza flip the track with the what to gutCheck em check chicka icka etta uhhVerse one:Fake niggaz get flippedIn mic fights I swing swords and cut clownShit is too swift to bite you record and write it downI flow like the blood on a murder scene, like a syringeOn some wild out shit, to insert a fiendBut it was yo out the shop stolen artCatch a swollen heart from not rollin smartI put mad pressure, on phony wack rhymes that get hurtShit's played, like zodiac signs on sweatshirtThat's minimum, and feminine like sandalsMy minimum table stacks a verse on a gambleEnergy is felt once the cards are dealtWith the impact of roundhouse kicks from black beltsThat attack, the mic-fones like cyclones or typhoonI represent from midnight to high noonI don't waste ink, nigga I thinkI drop megaton bombs more faster than you blinkCause rhyme thoughts travel at a tremendous speedClouds of smoke, of natural blends of weedOnly under one circumstance is if I'm bluntedTurn that shit up, my clan in da front want itChorusVerse two:I'm on a mission, that niggaz say is impossibleBut when I swing my swords they all choppableI be the body dropper, the heartbeat stopperChild educator, plus head amputatorCause niggaz styles are old like mark 5 sneakersLyrics are weak, like clock radio speakersDon't even stop in my station and attackWhile your plan failed, hit the rail, like amtrakWhat the fuck for?  down by low, I make lawI be justice, I sentence that ass two to fourRound the clock, that state pen time check itWith the pens I be stickin but you can't stick to crimeCame through with the wu, slid off on the dlI'm low-key like seashells, I rock these bells(when the mc's..) now come aboard, it's medina boundEnter the chamber, and it's a whole different soundIt's a wide entrance, small exit like a funnelSo deep it's picked up on radios in tunnelsNiggaz are fascinated how the shit beginGet vaccinated, my logo is branded in your skinChorus
