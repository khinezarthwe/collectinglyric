The sky glowsI see it shining when my eyes closeI hear your warnings but we both knowI'm gonna look at it againDon't wait, don't waitThe road is now a sudden seaAnd suddenly, you're deep enoughTo lay your armor downTo lay your armor downTo lay your armor downWell you get one lookI'll show you something that the knife tookA bit too early for my own goodNow let's not speak of it againDon't wait, don't waitThe road is now a sudden seaAnd suddenly, you're deep enoughTo lay your armor downTo lay your armor downTo lay your armor downDon't wait, don't waitThe lights will flash and fade awayThe days will pass you byDon't waitTo lay your armor downTo lay your armor downTo lay your armor downTo lay your armor downTo lay your armor down
