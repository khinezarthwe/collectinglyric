Strike while the iron is hotSteel is strongest so say we allAnd if we all were not brothers of metalWould we fall? No!They tried to test our spiritThey tasted steel before we were doneGrinding their bones into the dust of the pastAll blown away like a shot from a gunWe cast our lot togetherFour still stand as oneHere we'll remain foreverTill our kindgdom's oneBrothers of metalWe are fighting with power and steelFighting for metal, metal that's realBrothers of metal will always be thereStanding together with hands in the airLet us drink to the power, drink to the soundThunder and metal are shaking the groundDrink to your brothers who are never to fallWe're all brothers of metal here in the hallOur hearts are filled with metal and masters we have noneAnd we will die for metal, metal heals my sonBrothers of metalWe are fighting with power and steelFighting for metal, metal that's realBrothers of metal will always be thereStanding together with hands in the airLet us drink to the power drink to the soundThunder and metal are shaking the groundDrink to your brothers who are never to fallWe're all brothers of metal here in the hallBrothers of metalWe are fighting with power and steelFighting for metal, metal that's realBrothers of metal will always be thereStanding together with hands in the air
