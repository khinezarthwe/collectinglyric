This my excavation and today is KumranEverything that happens is from now onThis is pouring rainThis is paralyzedI keep throwing it down two-hundred at a timeIt's hard to find it when you knew itWhen your money's gone and you're drunk as hellOn your back with your racks and the stacks as your loadIn the back and the racks of the stacks are your loadIn the back with your racks and you're un-stacking your loadWell I've been twisting to the sun I needed to replaceThe fountain in the front yard is rusted outAll my love was down in a frozen groundThere's a black crow sitting across from me; his wiry legs are crossedAnd he's dangling my keys he even fakes a tossWhatever could it be that has brought me to this loss?On your back with your racks as the stacks as your loadIn the back and the racks and the stacks of your loadIn the back with your racks and you're un-stacking your loadThis is not the sound of a new man or crispy realizationIt's the sound of the unlocking and the lift awayYour love will beSafe with me
