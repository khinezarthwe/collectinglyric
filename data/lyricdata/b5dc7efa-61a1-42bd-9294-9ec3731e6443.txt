Maybe this time I'm finally losing my mindCause I could use the changeHaven't you heard?Things are way more absurdThey're even kind of strangeNothing you say could change meAnd things are as bad as they can beForget who's rightI knew I was wrong all alongSo why do we even bother?Cause I don't recall inviting you hereYou're spending another dollar watching me fallYou've placed the blameIt's too late to reclaimThe state of mind we're inIt doesn't look so goodI'd get out if I couldAnd never start againYou've tasted some brand new flavoursAnd used up the last of your favoursForget who's wrongI knew it'd be you all along
