When she goes storming outI run for coverRolling like thunder clouds,Hanging above herRinging the witching hourSpells that im singingRain come and drown me outSinking deep belowCan you go another roundI will follow you down and outLet's go another roundI will follow you down andWe could just lay aroundStare at the ceilingWant to forget aboutOne for the feelingRoom full of photographsBox full of lettersCome on make it lastNothing else matters right nowCan you go another roundI will follow you down and outLet's go another roundI will follow you down and outInstrumentalCan you go another roundI will follow you down and outLet's go another roundI will follow you down and outLet's go another roundI will bother you down and outLet's go another roundI will follow you down and outuhhh... uhhh...
