I got an empty feelin' when that moving van pulled upIt got a whole lot emptier as I watched them fill that truckAnd when they carried out your clothes it took my breath awayNow they're headed for that bedThe thought keeps runnin' though my headBaby, maybe, we should just sleep on it tonightAnd give our hearts just one more chance to change our mindsI could be wrong but goodbye, just don't feel rightSo baby, maybe, we should just sleep on it tonightI'll pay them boys to stop right nowAnd leave that truck out on the curbThe TV and the phone's packed upSo we won't be disturbedThere's not a light left in this roomJust a shadow of a doubtSo let's make sure we don't give upBefore we've thought this through enoughBaby, maybe, we should just sleep on it tonightAnd give our hearts just one more chance to change our mindsI could be wrong but goodbye, just don't feel rightSo baby, maybe, we should just sleep on it tonightBaby, maybe, we should just sleep on it tonightAnd give our hearts just one more chance to change our mindsI could be wrong but goodbye, just don't feel rightSo baby, maybe, baby, maybe, baby, maybeWe should just sleep on it tonight
