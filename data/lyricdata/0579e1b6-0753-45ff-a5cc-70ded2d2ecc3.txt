A mother sings a lullaby to a childSometime in the future the boy goes wildAnd all his nerves are feeling some kind of energyA walk in the woods and I will trySomething under the trees that made you cryIt's so erotic when your make-up runsI got wiring loose inside my headI got books that I never ever readI got secrets in my garden shedI got a scar where all my urges bledI got people underneath my bedI got a place where all my dreams are deadSwim with me into your blackest eyesA few minutes with me inside my vanShould be so beautiful if we canI'm feeling something taking over meI got wiring loose inside my headI got books that I never ever readI got secrets in my garden shedI got a scar where all my urges bledI got people underneath my bedI got a place where all my dreams are deadSwim with me into your blackest eyesI got wiring loose inside my headI got books that I never ever readI got secrets in my garden shedI got a scar where all my urges bledI got people underneath my bedI got a place where all my dreams are deadSwim with me into your blackest eyes
