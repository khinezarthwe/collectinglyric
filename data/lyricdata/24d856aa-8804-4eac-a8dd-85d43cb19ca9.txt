As the summer fades awayYou'll lead me to the gardenPassing the loversSwooning in the autumnSee yourselfYour image in the eyes of someone elseSee yourselfYour fears as they appear to someone elseWhen the sun setsOn dark silhouettesCollapse into dreamCollapse into dreamCollapse into dreamAs summer fades awayLaugh at my reflectionPassed to a loverSeeking your affectionSee yourselfYour image in the eyes of someone elseSee yourselfYour fears as they appear to someone elseWhen the sun setsOn dark silhouettesCollapse into dreamCollapse into dreamCollapse into dreamThough I knowYou won't be here for longThough I knowYou won't be here for longThough I knowYou won't be here for longThough I knowYou won't be here for longThough I knowYou won't be here for longThough I knowYou won't be here for longThough I knowYou won't be here for long
