Crazy governments try to find ways, how to blow other countries awaySitting back in Parliament, they've got fuck else to doSo they create a war for me and youLooking for answers, there's nothing to be foundBy sitting 'round a table discussing different townsWho shall we shit on?Who'll take the cruise?Have you heard about our future on the evening news?Send out troops - air, land and seaHow many killings in different countries?They're sitting in their limos, imposing on us their viewsThey don't give a fuck, they ain't gonna loseAin't it about time they looked for other ways of how to beat the problems?Because bombing and destroying people's never gonna solve them
