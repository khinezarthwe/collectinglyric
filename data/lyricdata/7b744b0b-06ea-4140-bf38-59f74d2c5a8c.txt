Walk in silenceDon't walk away, in silenceSee the dangerAlways dangerEndless talkingLife rebuildingDon't walk awayWalk in silenceDon't turn away, in silenceYour confusionMy illusionWorn like a mask of self-hateConfronts and then diesDon't walk awayPeople like you find it easyAching to seeWalking on airHunting by the riversThrough the streetsEvery corner abandoned too soonSet down with due careDon't walk away, in silenceDon't walk away
