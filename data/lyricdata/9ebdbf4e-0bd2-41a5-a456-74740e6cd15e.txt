(Yea yea yea yea yea, ooh)Dear Lord, can you take it away?This pain in my heart just follows me by day(Yea yea yea yea yea, ooh)And at night it stalks me like the shadows on my wallOh my goodness, goodnessFeels like the world is closing on meFeels like my dreams will never come to meI keep on slippin' deeper into myselfAnd I'm scared, so scared(Chorus)If you're troubledYou just gotta let it goIf you're worried, babyYou just gotta let it goAll your hustles ain't for nothin'You just gotta take it slowWhen you need me babyAll you do is let me knowWhy does it feelThat my mind is constantly tryin' to pull me down?I can't seem to get awayContinuous mistakes I know I've made beforeHow long will I feel so out of place?Chorus(music break)Chorus x4OhGirl I'll run to youYou is all I have to worryAmen
