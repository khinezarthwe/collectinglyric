In the air(Radiophonic) in the air(Radiophonic) in the airThe night was longNow the crowd has goneThere's sunlight on my bedFeels like a radiophonic workshop'sBeaming straight into my headIt could make you weepI can't get to sleepThere's ringing in my earsLike a radiophonic workshopOrchestrating all my stupid fearsCHORUS(Radiophonic) I think I'm in love(Radiophonic)(Radiophonic) I think I'm in love(Radiophonic)In the airMy skin is itchingI'm totally twitchingWith the pounding in my headLike a dub sub-sonic beat-boxBooming bass under the bedMy hands are shakingMy mind is achingWith a feeling deep insideThat you've been staringSending signalsEvery time our paths collideCHORUSThink I'm in loveIn the airCHORUSThink I'm in love(Radiophonic)
