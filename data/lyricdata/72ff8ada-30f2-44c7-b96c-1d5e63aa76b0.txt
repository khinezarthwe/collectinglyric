From a friend to a stranger, how's your lifeIn your current situationDid they hold you hostage, did they tell you lies?Just to add to your frustrationOh, my heartSo you drown the whole day, in your troubled heartOn the road to change your lifeNot to give it all away, but to sing your songâ€˜Cause in the end, that's where you arriveOh, my heart it breaks meWhen I hear them callin' meOh, to see inside myselfA guy can see that no one else could ever knowThe way we'd end up pleaseSo from a friend to a stranger, how's your lifeIn your current situationWish you happiness and freedom, and I wish you lifeWhen you reach your destinationYour destinationYour destination
