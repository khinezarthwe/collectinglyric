Angel came down from heaven yesterdayShe stayed with me just long enough to rescue meAnd she told me a story yesterdayAbout the sweet love between the moon and the deep blue seaAnd then she spread her wings high over meShe said she's gonna come back tomorrowAnd I said, "Fly on, my sweet angelFly on through the skyFly on, my sweet angelTomorrow I'm gonna be by your side"Sure enough, this morning came unto meSilver wings silhouetted against the child's sunriseAnd my angel, she said unto me"Today is the day for you to riseTake my hand, you're gonna be my manYou're gonna rise"And then she took me high over yonderAnd I said, "Fly on, my sweet angelFly on through the skyFly on, my sweet angelForever I will be by your side"
