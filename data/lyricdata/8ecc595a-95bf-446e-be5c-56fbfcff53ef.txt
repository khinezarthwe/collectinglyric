Cold september morn i was rebornThe sun gate crashed through my front doorUpon my soul, my life's made wholeI'd only ask for anymore if sometime soonIf i could wish upon your kiss then..Cold april night, no end in sightThe letters pile behind her doorUpon my soul, i'm growing oldI'd only ask for one thing more if sometime soonI'll be the words, you'll be the tuneSometimes i can't help falling down(x4)Cold september morn, i was reborn,The sun gate crashed through my front doorUpon my soul my life's made wholeI d only ask for one thing more if sometime soonIf i could fly upon your silenceSometimes i can't help falling down(x4)
