The red lights mean you're leavingThe white one's mean returningT-tell me how this story endsAnd I'll keep them fires burningThe headlights look like diamondsThe taillights burn like coalsT-tell me how this story endsBefore the fires go coldThe countryside's desertedThere's no one on the farmsThe suburbs all are sleepingThe earthquakes set off car alarmsAll after all now we awareAll after all the time we shareThere's so much fears of worldHopes of worldTears of world
