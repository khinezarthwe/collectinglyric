When we were growing up you always looked like you were having such funYou always were and you always will be the taller and the prettier onePeople seem to love you, they gravitate towards youThat's why I started to hate you so much, and I just completely ignored youI don't know why I felt the need to keep it up for oh so longIt's all my fault, I'm sorry, you did absolutely nothing wrongI don't know why I felt the need to drag it out for all these yearsAll the pain I've caused you, the constant flow of all the tearsBelieve me when I say that I cannot apologise enoughWhen all you ever wanted from me was a token of my loveAnd if it's not too late could you please find it deep within your heartTo try and go back, go back to the start?Go back to the startI've been so evil with my constant invasionsBut you made it so easy for me, you always rise to the occasionI'll always pull you up on every stupid thing that you sayBut I found it so entertaining, messing around with your headI don't know why I felt the need to keep it up for oh so longIt's all my fault, I'm sorry, you did absolutely nothing wrongI don't know why I felt the need to drag it out for all these yearsAll the pain I've caused you, the constant flow of all the tearsBelieve me when I say that I cannot apologise enoughWhen all you ever wanted from me was a token of my loveAnd if it's not too late could you please find it deep within your heartTo try and go back, go back to the start?Go back to the startGo back to the startGo back to the startThis is not just a song, I intend to put these words into actionI hope that it sums up the way that I feel to your satisfactionI don't know why I felt the need to keep it up for oh so longIt's all my fault, I'm sorry, you did absolutely nothing wrongI don't know why I felt the need to drag it out for all these yearsAll the pain I've caused you, the constant flow of all the tearsBelieve me when I say that I cannot apologise enoughWhen all you ever wanted from me was a token of my loveAnd if it's not too late, could you please find it deep within your heartTo try and go back, go back to the start?Go back to the start
