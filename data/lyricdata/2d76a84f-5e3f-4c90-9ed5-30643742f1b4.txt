That's it, turn the page on the day, walk awayCos they're sensing what I sayI'm 45th generation RomanBut I don't know 'emOr care when I'm spittingSo return to your sitting position and listenIt's fittingI'm miles ahead and they chase meShow your face on TV, then we'll seeYou can't do half, my crew laughsAt your Roobarb and Custard versesYour rain down curses but I'm waving,Your hearse is driving byStreets riding high, with the beats in the skyAll stare, eyes glazedGarage burnt down, the fire ragedFor 40 days and in 40 waysBut through the blaze they see it fadeThe sea of black, the beaming heat on their facesTheir figure emerges from the wasteageEyes transfixed with a piercing gazeOne hand clutching a sword raised to the skyThey wonder how, they wonder whyThe sky turns white it all becomes clearThey felt lifted from their fearsThey shed tears in the lightAfter 6 dark yearsYoung bold soldiers, the fire burnsCracks and smoulders5 years older and wiserThe fires are burning on fire, never tireSlave warriors in the forests and on higherWe sing, hear the strings risingThe war's over, the bells ringMemories fading, soldiers slayingLooks like Geezers ravingThe hazy fog over the bull ring,The lazy ways the birds singA new babys born every dayFew men may be scorn todayBut look at things the other wayCos it may well be your final dayAnd then the crowds roar they slay, they all sayI produce this using only my bare witGimme a jungle a garage beat and admit defeat,Use war and past injury as my metaphor and simileGet all applications into before the deadlineCos it's a fine line between strife or crimeAnd a life of crimeBut you will reach the day, and it's all mineYou can take it or leave, I shakeAnd reveal stage tricks like Jimi HendrixIn the afterlife Gladiators meet their makerThrown through the wind fields and lakes of BluewaterTo the next life from the fortressAway from the knives and slaughterTo their wives and daughtersOnce more before the law judges over all of us,Cos in this place you'll see me,Brace yourself, cos this goes deep,I'll show you the secrets the sky and the birdsActions speak louder than wordsStand by me my apprenticeBe brave, clench fists.
