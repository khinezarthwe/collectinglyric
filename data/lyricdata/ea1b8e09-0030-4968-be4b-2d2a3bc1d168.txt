[Music: James Gulotta][Lyrics: Brian Zimmerman, Chris Lykins]Your life begins at 17, you enlist with Uncle SamTrained for battle, prepared to die, you don't give a damn.Your weapon is your life and love shooting the enemy down.Killing women and children and everyting aroundFirst fought for freedom now for pleasure, you've become obsessedNever feel at ease until you're laid to restSargeant tells you and you carry out his every command.No return from this life you're on the 4 year plan.[Chorus:]Born to killThere's no retreatLive to fightA Killing machinePoliticians play a deadly game nowyou play it tooOnce you die, you're forgotten they'll find somebody newSeeing through different eyes much better than the oldBlock out all the needles carnageyour heart grows coldStripped of your humanity, no choice but to obeyTurned into a predator, civilians are your prey[Repeat Chorus][1st solo: Chris][2nd solo: Rick]Seeing through different eyes much better than the oldBlock out all the needles carnageyour heart grows coldStripped of your humanity, no choice but to obeyTurned into a predator, civilians are your preyPoliticians play a deadly game nowyou play it tooOnce you die, you're forgotten they'll find somebody new[Repeat Chorus][Solo: Rick]
