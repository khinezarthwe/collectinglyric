There’s no earthly way of knowing…Which direction we are going…There’s no knowing where we’re rowing…Or which way the river’s flowing…Is it raining…Is it snowing…Is a hurricane a-blowing…Not a speck of light is showing…So the danger must be growing…Are the fires of hell a-glowing…Is the grizzly reaper mowing…Yes!The dangers must be growing…For the rowers keep on rowing!And they’re  CERTAINLY NOT SHOWING…ANY SIGNS THAT THEY ARE SLOWING!!Stop the boat
