I left Howse without a fucking clueAnd left New York City, girl, without youBut the sun does shine in this place some daysAnd even when there's clouds, there isn't always rainI'll stow away my greysIn a padlocked case in a padlocked roomOnly to be releasedWhen I sing all the songs I wrote about youThis is the last one I'll doNow I'm free in parenthesesAnd I'm not sure what I ought to do with itIt sits in the house, bright eyes and raised handsIf I ignore its advances then the hand goes downI'll stow away my greysIn a padlocked case and in a padlocked roomOnly to be releasedWhen I sing all the songs I wrote about youOh, this is the last one I'll doI feel better and better and worse and then betterThan ever, than ever, than everI feel much better and better and worse and then betterThan ever, than ever, than ever, than everI'll stow away my greysIn a padlocked case and in a padlocked roomOnly to be releasedWhen I see you walking around with someone newThis is the last songThis is the last songThis is the last song I'll write about you
