So you've been crying hard againI know there's nothing I can do about itBrushing off your hands with my arms set to sympatheticHave you've already got your ticketGot your ride, got your paper bagAll set for quilt and panic attacksShouldn't lend it out if your so scared you'll never get it backIf you get back, if you get backSo ghost the festivalsLine up on the carouselsHow we drink for freeIn a cold marqueeAnd be out by darkI'm still breathlessGhost the festivalsGlide over the rolling hillsAll cartoon headsAnd a sea of tentsI'm less eloquentAnd I'm still breathlessSo all I want to do is sit and watch the riots on the last nightDropping all the lamps till the fires are our only lightHow your leaving and I don't know if I'll ever get to see you againKeep talking, we'll sink into the mudStepping through the wreckage, all the cans and the skeletal tentsIt becomes us, it becomes usSo ghost the festivalsLine up on the carouselsHow we drink for freeIn a cold marqueeAnd be out by darkI'm still breathlessGhost the festivalsGlide over the rolling hillsAll cartoon headsAnd a sea of tentsI'm less eloquentAnd I'm still breathlessBroken heartedLights outLights out!So ghost the festivalsLine up on the carouselsHow we drink for freeIn a cold marqueeAnd be out by darkI'm still breathlessGhost the festivalsGlide over the rolling hillsAll cartoon headsAnd a sea of tentsI'm less eloquentAnd I'm still breathlessWhoo!
