Sinking through dark black holesIt's never going to endOpen gash in my ribcageIs never going to mendTake another picture off the wallSinking deeper every time I fallEach day ends quickerAnd my mind gets slower tooAs my life just fades awayI wouldn't have a clueTake another drawer out from the shelfI'm too weak to do it by myselfThough you had the world at your feetYou could see it, I was blindHad the perfect job called lifeYou didn't like it, you resignedBrain's a square of grassGrowing on petrol and chlorineWith petrol and chlorineYou could see it, I was blindHad the perfect job called lifeYou didn't like it, you resignedWith petrol and chlorineYou know just what I meanWith petrol and chlorineYou know just what I mean
