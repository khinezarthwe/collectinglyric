These chords are old but we shake hands'Cause I believe that they're the good guysWe can use all the help we canSo many minor chords outsideI fell in love with the soundOh I love to sing along with youWe got tunes we kicked around someWe got a bucket that the tunes go throughBabe we both had dry spells,hard times in bad landsI'm a good manfor ya, I'm a good manLast night there was a horse in the roadI was twisting in the hairpinMy hands held on my mind let goAnd back to you my heart went skippingI found the inside of the roadThought about the first time that I met youAll those glances that we stoleSometimes, if you want them then you¹ve got toBabe we both had dry spells,hard times in bad landsI'm a good manfor ya, I'm a good manThey shot a Western south of hereThey had him cornered in a canyonAnd even his horse had disappearedThey said it got run down by a bad, bad manYou're not a good shot but I¹m worseAnd there¹s so much where we ain't been yetSo swing up on this little horseThe only thing we'll hit is sunsetBabe we both had dry spells,hard times in bad landsI'm a good manfor ya, I'm a good manBabe we both hadBabe we both hadBaby we both hadBabe we both hadYou and I both hadBabe we both hadBabe we both hadBabe we both had dry spells,hard times in bad landsI'm a good manfor ya, I'm a good man
