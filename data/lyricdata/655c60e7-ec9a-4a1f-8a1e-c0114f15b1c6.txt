Sometimes I feel like I am drunk behind the wheelThe wheel of possibility, however it may rollGive it a spin, see if it can somehow factor inYou know there's always more than one wayTo say exactly what you mean to sayWas I out of my head? Was I out of my mind?How could I have ever been so blind?I was waiting for an indicationIt was hard to findDon't matter what I say, only what I doI never mean to do bad things to youSo quiet that I finally woke upIf you're sad then it's time you spoke up tooWas I out of my head? Was I out of my mind?How could I have ever been so blind?I was waiting for an invitationIt was hard to findDon't matter what I say, only what I doI never mean to do bad things to youSo quiet but I finally woke upIf you're sad then it's time you spoke up... too
