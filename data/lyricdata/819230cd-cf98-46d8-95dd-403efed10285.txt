Your last words will not be heard.There's too many of them no one deserves.I don't need your love.Landmines hiding your lines.Too many maps and not enough signs.I don't need your love.So lie awake. So wide awake.'Cause in my dreams I'm dying.Wait for light to kill the night,But is it worth me trying?A deep breath out on the steps.It's from the air you feel in your chest.I don't need your love.Okay, you staked your claim.It's only blood you have in your veins.I don't need your love.So lie awake. Wide awake.'Cause in my dreams I'm dying.The sun will rise, the moon will die,But is it worth me trying?And it's so late. Where will you stay?It makes no difference, cause it's all a dream.And tomorrow I'll wake. Tomororow I'll wake.It makes no difference. It makes no difference.Lie awake.Time will take all the dreams we're dying.Close your eyes. The moon will sigh.Is it worth me trying?
