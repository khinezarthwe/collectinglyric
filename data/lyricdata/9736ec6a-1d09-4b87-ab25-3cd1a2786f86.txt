Standing in the back of the lineI feel the others try to push me downAnd keep it away from meGrabbing at the one thing that I know is mineCan't you see me with my head to the floorFeel the recklessness of absolute desperationValued sentimental pieces ofThe life I thought I held in my handsWhy do I always tryTo better what I am?Can't I realizeThat I've always been sinking?Failing everydayIt only helps to aggravateThe sickening feeling insideThat won't go awayFall downPick yourself up and fall downDrink from my cup and fall downThis is what it's like to be me, meCan't you see what I see?Why do I always tryTo better what I am?Can't I realizeThat I've always been sinking?Why do I always tryTo better what I am?Can't I realizeThat I've always been sinking?What I am is what I feelBut what I feel is nothing realAnd what I know is all I wantIs to be saved from this spotTo be saved from this spotTo be saved from this spotWhy do I always tryTo better what I am?Can't I realizeThat I've always been sinking?Why do I always tryTo better what I am?Can't I realizeThat I've always been sinking?
