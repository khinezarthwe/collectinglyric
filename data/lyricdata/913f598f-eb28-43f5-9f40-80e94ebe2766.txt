Come and take me down the dark beyondAnd take me there where I come fromTake me down to the place where I'll kneelAnd let me lay my shadow downIn through the eyes of a child's inner meNo pain to heal my bloodied browThere is no rain to save this silent townThere is no rain to save at allThere is no place to save this silent groundThere is no place to save at allOh Father take me unto where I'll lay me downOn Hallowed GroundOh the sky is fallingAnd I don't know where my home is nowMy Hallowed GroundOh and can you take meFor I have tasted Hallowed GroundOh all aroundFather - do you hear meThis pain I will not cry aloudFather - I know you hear meMy head is bludgeoned but unbowed(Repeat chorus)
