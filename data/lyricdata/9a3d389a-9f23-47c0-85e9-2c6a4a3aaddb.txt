Locked away, I'm hidden from your sightForced to live in artificial lightMade to suffer because of what I'm notA casualty in a war that must be foughtSo here I wait like the ones that came beforeAnd when I'm gone they'll need a thousand moreYou've decided that my life is yours to takeSo now I'm trapped in a world I did not make(Chorus:)Let me goLeave me beStop your testsSet me freeIn my cell, I'm waiting for your testWhat hidden law makes you better than the restYou feed me drugs and see what you have madeDay by day situation growing worseYou weren't content to let neture take its courseNow you suffer by the toxins that you useTerrified by the fate that you helped choose(Repeat chorus)(Solo: Skowron)(Repeat verse)(Repeat chorus)
