Hold me downSo I don't leap onto the wallWith the fever of it allThat would encourage mayhemThey're quite a rowdy crowd, do you think?And I'm going to the peak of somethingLovely feeling, slippy breathingTell me how to break the newsThere's no way that I can loose my love and it's taken over meI feel as if this love could last foreverAs if my luck and hope have found each otherI feel as if I should have known, togetherWe make good sense to me and I believeWho just saidSome girls don't get a second chanceWhen I've toyed and I've romancedI'm on the edge of somethingInner soothing, man-approvingTell me how to take the newsThere's no way that I can loose my love and it's taken over me
