McCormack and Richard Tauber are singing by the bedThere's a glass of punch below your feet and an angel at your headThere's devils on each side of you with bottles in their handsYou need one more drop of poison and you'll dream of foreign landsWhen you pissed yourself in Frankfurt and got syph down in CologneAnd you heard the rattling death trains as you lay there all aloneFrank Ryan brought you whiskey in a brothel in MadridAnd you decked some fucking blackshirt who was cursing all the YidsAt the sick bed of Cuchulainn we'll kneel and say a prayerAnd the ghosts are rattling at the door and the devil's in the chairAnd in the Euston Tavern you screamed it was your shoutBut they wouldn't give you service so you kicked the windows outThey took you out into the street and kicked you in the brainsSo you walked back in through a bolted door and did it all againAt the sick bed of Cuchulainn we'll kneel and say a prayerAnd the ghosts are rattling at the door and the devil's in the chairYou remember that foul evening when you heard the banshees howlThere was lazy drunken bastards singing Billy in the bowlThey took you up to midnight mass and left you in the lurchSo you dropped a button in the plate and spewed up in the churchNow you'll sing a song of liberty for blacks and paks and jocksAnd they'll take you from this dump you're in and stick you in a boxThen they'll take you to Cloughprior and shove you in the groundBut you'll stick your head back out and shout "We'll have another round"At the graveside of Cuchulainn we'll kneel around and prayAnd God is in His heaven, and Billy's down by the bay
