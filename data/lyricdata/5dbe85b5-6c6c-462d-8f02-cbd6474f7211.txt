I am lostThe footprints that I left have disappearedFor now, I am driving blindAccelerateWithout a destination to welcome meThis road is just an endless loopEvery time I close my eyesThe noise inside me amplifiesI can't escapeI relive every moment of the dayEvery misstep I have madeFinds a way it can invadeMy every thoughtAnd this is why I find myself awakeDirectionlessThe letters on the signs have long since fadedThe sky conspires to swallow mePaid the priceFor burning all the maps to warm myselfI threw their ashes to the windEvery time I close my eyesThe noise inside me amplifiesI can't escapeI relive every moment of the dayEvery misstep I have madeFinds a way it can invadeMy every thoughtAnd this is why I find myself awakeWalk awayTime to leave the realm of the familiarTo find a place where sleep can comeHesitateFor one last time I shout into the skyTo wake the ones I'll leave behindEvery time I close my eyesThe noise inside me amplifiesI can't escapeI relive every moment of the dayEvery misstep I have madeFinds a way it can invadeMy every thoughtAnd this is why I find myself awakeEvery time I close my eyesThe noise inside me amplifiesI can't escapeI relive every moment of the dayEvery misstep I have madeFinds a way it can invadeMy every thoughtAnd this is why I find myself awake
