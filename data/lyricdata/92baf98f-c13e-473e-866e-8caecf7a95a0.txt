Sat at the side of the pool at one of your housesWith wet white trousers onAnd worlds collide as the evening continuesThe dignity fucks offHer brother's gone off to the strippersTo make up for all the lost timeShe could have been one of the bitchesBut she's actually alrightI'm sorry, but we're all unsureHow much you've had butmaybe not have any moreA country home, even if we really triedWhat if it's just surprises now?And I bet your dad would like to give us all a slapWhen are your parents back? d'you know?Well I never came from no ghettoBut it wasn't nowhere near hereWell-spoken girls in stilettosAren't something to fearI'm sorry, but we're all unsureHow much you've had butmaybe not have any moreI'm sorry, but we're all unsureHow much you've had butmaybe not have any moreCigarette smoke doesn't hideAs well as you thinkAnd you'dAct as the perfect disguise
