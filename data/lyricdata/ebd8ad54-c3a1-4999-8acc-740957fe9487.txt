So the camera is finishedIt runs automatic, it's time for new film.You were developing photos with the date on the paper of a past lover.I was the apple you've eatenthe boy who put on all of his clothes.Now I'm a memory that hangs with a thumbtack on the wall.And this town is built with high heels and designer clothespeople prance like puppet strings around the barand i saw you standing there with your finger around your straw.Yeah, it was long brown hairyou looked like leaves falling in autumnAnd my mouth was openingtry throwing up the wordsbut i guess i'll stick to this drinkand now that you occur, the first time that a girlshe said she would crucify you with lieslike walking against the windbelieving in religioncuz' god, i still hate you so muchso give me my dreamor pour me this drinkcuz' thats all you're good for.and there's a white horse that carries a burning lightand just guide me to happy moments and another lineand I'm cutting up my daily value and sending it through a strawand the bigger my heart grows, come on black blood.So i'm tired of living herejust pass me the money nowlike its all  a surprising??lets ride up to the sunand burn our eyes  til dusk?cuz there's no such thing as lovelike the old poets saidas hard as it is to drink this shitthe more the glass will be half fullso give me my dreamor pour me this drinkcuz thats all you're good for.and i try to betray a lielike punching through the glasswith this throw, drink this bad blood downand give meÂ ??and shower me, my lovewith the world's green water.
