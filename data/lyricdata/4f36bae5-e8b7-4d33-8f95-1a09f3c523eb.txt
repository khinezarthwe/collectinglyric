For all of the times I tried to make you seeWell I'm sorry, yeah I'm sorryBut I still don't understand who you expected me to beBut I'm sorry, yeah I'm sorryWell I'm sorry for you and I'm sorry for meGoodbye babe well I'm up off my kneesYou're so easy to love and you're so hard to pleaseI'm not looking for acceptanceI'm not looking for a placeI'm not trying to impress youI'm not looking for appraiseBut I was looking for somethingThat I can defaceGoodbye babe when you're blue 'tis so rareYou're so easy to love but there's nothing really thereTwenty-two countries in twenty-two daysWith you in my head, with you in my headTwenty-two nights, just trying to eraseEvery word that you said, every word that you saidBut it still makes me sick I'm so easily in loveGoodbye babe when it's hard to turn roundYou're so easy to love and so hard to tie down
