There's a wonderful world where all you desireand everything you've longed for is at your fingertips,where the bittersweet taste of life is at your lips,where aisles and aisles of dreams await you,the cool promise of ecstasy fills the air.At the end of each working day she's waiting there.I'm in love with the queen of the supermarket.As the evening sky turns blue,a dream awaits in aisle number two.With my shopping cart I move through the heartof a sea of fools so blissfully unawarethat they're in the presence of something wonderful and rare.The way she moves behind the counter.Beneath her white apron her secrets remain hers.As she bag the groceries, her eyes so bored and sure she's unobserved.I'm in love with the queen of the supermarket.There's nothing I can say.Each night I take my groceriesand I drift away.And I drift away.Guidance from the gods above.At night I pray for the strength to tell herwhy I love, I love, I love, I love her so.Take my place in the checkout linetill one moment, her eyes meet mineand lift it up, lift it up, lift it up, lift it up.I'm in love with the queen of the supermarket.Though a company cap covers her hair,nothing can hide the beauty waiting thereThe beauty waiting there.I'm in love with the queen of the supermarket.I'm in love with the queen of the supermarket.As I lift my groceries into my carI turn back for a moment and catch a smilethat blows this whole fuckin' place apart.I'm in love with the queen of the supermarket.I'm in love with the queen of the supermarket.I'm in love with the queen of the supermarket.
