People are always saying how do you do to youand they don't know what's on your mind.You'll get fat running on the beaten trackCause dice can change your mind.Well I rolled it a long the floor one nightAnd have you ever been a bad bad manCaught up in the beat she had the devils dancing feetAs the tears flew to lover's eyes.The same thing happens every morningAnd I know the reason whyThe sun goes down and the council lights go onAnd everybody's sky highWith sedatives and authority to cryPeople are always saying how do you do to meThey need to speak what's on their mindYou roll the dice and you don't think twiceIf this can change your lifeWell I rolled a high and it made me feel aliveI tell you man I nearly diedIt made me think what's worse broken promise or my bonesAnd the bruising of my pride knocked me off my sideThe same thing happens every eveningAnd I know the reason whyThe sun goes down and the council lights go onAnd everybody's left standing round the firewith the same old song.You've got to change(da-da-da-da-da-da-da)(repeat)Don't let them tell you that you don't matterLife's more than a chip shop wrapperThey don't like what you do
