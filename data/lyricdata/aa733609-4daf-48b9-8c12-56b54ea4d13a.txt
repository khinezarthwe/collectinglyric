Every face I see is cold as iceEverything I touch is paleEver since I lost imaginationLike a stream that flows into the seaI am lost for all eternityEver since you took your love away from meSometimesThe sound of goodbyeIs louderThan any drumbeatSometimesThe sound of goodbyeIs louderThan any drumbeatEvery face I see is cold as iceEverything I touch is paleEver since I lost imaginationLike a stream that flows into the seaI am lost for all eternityEver since you took your love away from meSometimesThe sound of goodbyeIs louderThan any drumbeatSometimesThe sound of goodbyeIs louderThan any drumbeatSometimesThe sound of goodbyeIs louderThan any drumbeatSometimesThe sound of goodbyeIs louderThan any drumbeat
