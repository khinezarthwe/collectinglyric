Talk about a study of selfishness, he was a hopeless case.Drinking all the milk and leaving nonefor his wife to drink.Skin is so tight to make things go right almost every night.Failing just to fail and put it off till it feels alright.I won't pick up the telephone 'cause there's 900 people, and they're all alone, all used up like the cans of paint in the garage.Drinking diet soda and watching all of your baseball games.Staying indoors on the days that you know that the sun may break.Choking on the words that you want to say to your friends tonight.I won't pick up the telephone 'cause there's 900 people, and they're all alone, all used up like the cans of paint in the garage.
