It's so hard to see when your eyes are rolling in the back of your headIt's even harder to speak when everything you say just comes out wrongGutted like a pig, all you want is the world to bleed,someone somewhere stole your desireThe pain akin to, being punched in the throat, and stabbed in the chestYou would rather bleed than be without herGone are the tender whispers dancing in your earsReplaced with lackluster memories you cry, your screams play in your empty roomIt's so hard to see when your eyes are rolling in the back of your headIt's even harder to speak when everything you say just comes out wrongYour bed swallows you whole as the days bleed together, torment on the lipsOf a loved one, and if you try hard enough,you can almost taste her, feel her pass andScream, OH GOD WHY MEYou would rather bleed than be without herGone are the tender whispers dancing in your earsReplaced with lackluster memories you cry, your screams play in your empty roomIt's so hard to see when your eyes are rolling in the back of your headIt's even harder to speak when everything you say just comes out wrong
