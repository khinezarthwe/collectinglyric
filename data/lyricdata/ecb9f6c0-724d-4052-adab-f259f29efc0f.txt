Oh, said you suddenly, can you see what is?Oh, are you gonna see? The dead beesOh, what you want from me and my dulled ear?Oh, what you gonna see? A dead deer, a dead deerOh, child you settle down, lest he comes backOh, do you wanna see a dead rat?No, he ain't coming back, he's stretching on a rackOh, have you ever seen? A dead man, a dead manNo, you go in front of me for to breathe the airOh, are you gonna see, the dead mareCome now, don't make a sound, don't you say a wordOh, you wanna see? The dead bird, a dead bird
