You can't quit until you tryYou can't live until you dieYou can't learn to tell the truthUntil you learn to lieYou can't breathe until you chokeYou gotta laugh when you're the jokeThere's nothing like a funeral to make you feel aliveJust open your eyesAnd see that life is beautifulWill you swear on your lifeThat no one will cry at my funeral?I know some things that you don'tI've done things that you won'tThere's nothing like a trail of bloodTo find your way back homeI was waiting for my hearseWhat came next was so much worseIt took a funeral to make me feel aliveJust open your eyesAnd see that life is beautifulWill you swear on your lifeThat no one will cry at my funeral?
