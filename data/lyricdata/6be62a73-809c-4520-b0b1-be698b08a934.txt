You keep me comin' home againYou keep me comin' home againWhen you were gone, I met a friendShe taught me how to live in the endYou keep me comin' home againYou keep me comin' home againAre her eyes brown or blue?How does she keep her static cool?My heart and soul are rocked up in her eyesA little blink I, I recognizeA little blink, yeah, that's my prizeA white horse sittin' right there by her sideHard to ignore, hard to disguiseWhen will she ever realize?You keep me coming home againYou keep me coming home againWhen you were gone, I was out of my mindI had a friend who laughed all the timeI had a friend who cried all the timeI had a friend who screamed all the timeI had a friend who lied all the time
