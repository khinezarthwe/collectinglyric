I see they got your picture in this timeYou already cut it out and framed itYou say you like them when they're ragingYou read the caption out aloud"I just love the things that haven't been done before"Emotions, estethics and animal rightsWhat are these to a man with your abilitiesYour talent is close to boiling overIf we could understandWe wouldn't bother you with one or two missing catsBut you know it's a shameless piece of shitStill you love yourself in many different ways tonightBecause you know they can't really get youYou and your art is sacred and they don't like you because you're newSay would you explain this a second timeThese dead birds on toothpicks tell me nothingYou complain about the lack of wordsWhile I can hardly breatheYou say the smell is there to help me understandAnd you know, it's a shameless piece of shitStill you love yourself in many different ways tonightBecause you know they can't really get youYou and your art is sacred and they don't like you because you're newAnd you know you're evil, but who's to tell?Still you love yourself in many different ways tonightBecause you know they can't really get youYou and your art is sacred and they don't like you because you're new
