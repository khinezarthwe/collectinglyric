Way a little baby wraps the hand around your fingerSunshine on your face, in the first dawn lightWay she waits to let the moment lingerWay the future's always gonna bring surpriseIt ain't cocaine running through your veinsBeluga caviar on the Gravy TrainIt ain't cocaine as you sip champagneAs you toast hightimes on the Gravy TrainSo many vampires in the night, all of the riches in this timeI know you're mineWaiting for the lightning so exciting after the thunderThe twinkle in your eyes, the starlight shinesThe diamond in your mind is cut from wonderI know how you're feeling, and you're feeling fineIt ain't cocaine running through your veinsBeluga caviar on the Gravy TrainIt ain't cocaine as you sip champagneAs you toast hightimes on the Gravy TrainSo many vampires in the night, all of the riches in this timeI know you're mine, I know you're mineAnd we got all the time in the worldYeah, we got all the time in the world
