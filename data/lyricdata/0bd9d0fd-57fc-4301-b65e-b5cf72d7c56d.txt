I've got shovels for my handsAnchors for my legsWings jut out of my shoulder bladesI can go anywhereI can't go anywhereI'm trapped in a mirrorAnd you're certainly no hammerLike the fiery sunWhose touch nothing outrunsBut the craters of the arctic moonMy burning eyes are after youSo add another notchIn your painted town I'll rotAs another nameless blockWhat's learned won't quickly be forgot
