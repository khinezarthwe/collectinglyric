What would there beAs the river of sadness turns into seaCould there be another thousand stories like you and meWanted a heart,Wanted a soulMore than anything else in this worldBut we are doomedOur flesh and woundsI would never give inJust like the Moon doesWe rise'n'shine'n'fallOver you that IRise'n'shine'n'crawlVictims aren't we all!What would there beBeyond the eyes of Brandon LeeCould there beA revenging angelLeft to bleedWanted the truth,wanted the faithMore than anything else in this worldBut we are doomedBody and soul maroonedI would never give inJust like the Moon doesWe rise'n'shine'n'fallOver you that IRise'n'shine'n'crawlVictims aren't we all!
