The comforting acheOf the summer holidaysPointless days piningAfternoons whiningThe suburbs screamAt passers byThey scream of escapeA mute sirenIn wasted lightHope takes flightI don’t mind losing self-respectI’ve done it before and I’ll do it againI’m stifled tonight, which is fineI’ve done it before and I’ll do it againBillboards evanesceUnder regular beams of lightToothpaste smilesDon’t seem so brightHomogenize!Don’t revise!I don’t mind losing self-respect.I’ve done it before and I’ll do it again.I’m thwarted tonight, which is fineYou see I’ve done it before and I’ll do it againThe kids are sick again.Nothing to look forward toThey jumped the cliff againFuture sinks beneath the blue.The kids are sick again.Nothing to look forward toThey jumped the cliff againFuture sinks beneath the blue.The kids are sick again.Nothing to look forward toThey jumped the cliff againFuture sinks beneath the blue.The kids are sick again.Nothing to look forward to.
