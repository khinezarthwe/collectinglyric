Returning to solaceSo sweet like honeysuckle on the tongueThe sound of silence blesses my earsEnveloping like the earth I will one day lie inMetropolis is bad to wither the soulRoaring concrete and steel washes you in blood.So let you point and laughProvincial ain't so bad.Take me back down to where I belongTo rust in rivers.I do not covet any man's lifeI know my place all to wellOne man's paradise is another man's living hell.To each their ownGenerations ago made this place my ownThe roots are deep and strongCarry them wherever I go.Never wanted your approvalNever wanted your acceptanceNever wanted to be anything but meNever wanted to be anywhere but here.Carry me Southeast bound homeTo speak in defense of our good nameLay me to rest with my kinIn the ground of God's country.Lash out at any who would smear you with hateDeify no one, Never crawl ashamedThe past screams injustice on Southern night windWhips Manacles Chains Musket ballsA dark history never forgottenOnly misconception remains.Speak in defense of our good nameThe blood of kin grants absolutionI'll join them soon enough kin the ground of God's country.Never wanted your acceptanceNever wanted your approvalNever wanted to be anything but meNever wanted to be anywhere but here.
