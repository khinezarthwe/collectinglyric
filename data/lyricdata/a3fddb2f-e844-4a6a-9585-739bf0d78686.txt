Senseless steps taken blindly in agonyGrasping for something for air for purityWords just hanging there like a hook missing baitI have no pigment to define this shapeThe notes of decayLearned from the mouth of violenceI sang them everydayTill I became a silenceI say that I am okayCut edges and pretendThat I have a heart that I can mendThe hands that used to be a part of meWere tortured by my demon's destructive needsFrom pieces of ruin I will deployI'll construct a pretty temple to destroy
