See them walking hand in hand across the bridge at midnightHeads turning as the lights flashing out, it's so brightThen walk right out to the four-line trackThere's a camera rolling on her backOn her backAnd I sense the rhythm humming in a frenzyAll the way down her spineGirls on filmGirls on filmGirls on filmGirls on filmLipstick cherry all over the lens as she's fallingAnd miles of sharp blue water coming in where she liesThe diving man's coming up for air'Cause the crowd all love pulling Dolly by the hairBy the hairAnd she wonders how she ever got hereAs she goes under againGirls on film (Two minutes later)Girls on filmGirls on film (Got your picture)Girls on filmWider, baby, smiling, you've just made a millionFuses pumping live heat twisting out on a wireTake one last glimpse into the nightI'm touching close, I'm holding brightHolding tightGive me shudders in a whisperTake me up 'til I'm shooting a starGirls on film (She's more than a lady)Girls on filmGirls on film (Two minutes later)Girls on filmGirls on film (See you together)Girls on filmGirls on film (See you later)Girls on film
