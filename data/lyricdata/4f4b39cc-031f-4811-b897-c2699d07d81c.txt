Let's swim to the moonUh-huhLet's climb thru the tidePenetrate the evenin' that the city sleeps to hideLet's swim out tonight, loveIt's our turn to tryParked beside the oceanOn our moonlight driveLet's swim to the moonUh-huhLet's climb thru the tideSurrender to the waiting worlds that lap against our sideNothing left openAnd no time to decideWe've stepped into a riverOn our moonlight driveLet's swim to the moonLet's climb thru the tideYou reach a hand to hold meBut I can't be your guideEasy to love you as I watch you glideFalling through wet forestsOn our moonlight driveMoonlight driveC'mon, baby, gonna take a little rideGoin' down by the ocean sideGonna get real closeGet real tightBaby gonna drown tonightGoin' down, down, down
