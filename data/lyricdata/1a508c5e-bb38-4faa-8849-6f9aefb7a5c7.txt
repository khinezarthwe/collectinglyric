You took it backHow could you go and do something like thatMy fingernail phaseWorst has got the best of youI ask you and I know I need to change(Chorus)You took it backYou ripped my heart out of me then you put it backI'm pulling my hairI let you just a million timesI love you even though it isn't fairChangeRun we go around again in circlesPlay this game over againRun we go around again in circles(Repeat Chorus)Run we go around again in circlesPlay this game over again.Run we go around again in circlesYou took it back   (2x)Run we go round again in circles
