Goodby my love, I leave my fate to the kingI must be off to battle, fortune it may bringFortune for the noblesDeath and Pain, life will be soldGoodby my love, I must fight and I may dieThe king is calling, I must obeywhy do we have to killThe Reaper laughs, I hear him stillScreams above the battlefieldSteel and Blood a fate is sealedThe harvester of Death is outCan't you hear him scream aloud[Chorus:]Into the battle, into the battleCan't you hear the screams from flodden hillSeptember the 3rd of fifteen thirteenWe met the English at Flodden HillGod knows we gave it allA damned day, I saw many fallI stood with my king and he fought like hellPierced with arrows, he finally fellWith the king fell Scotland's PrideA damned day, so many died
