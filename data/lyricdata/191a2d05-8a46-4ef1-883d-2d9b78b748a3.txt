I'm not going to give it up for free anymore& I don't really care if you label me a whore.Frayed at the edges, busted at the seams,I can walk with a song & sleep with my dreams.You can cover up your chains & call yourself free;It doesn't really matter - it's all the same to me.You're the new newest thing; we've seen it all before.In fact I've seen it many times & I'll see it many more.You know it won't last; you know it never does -But better be a has been than to be a never was.You can get out quick & clean or prolong the agony:Whichever you prefer - it's all the same to me.You worship the future like it's some kind of saint,But it's just like the past with a new coat of paint.You try to save a world that doesn't want to be saved& you scold it like a child when you think it's misbehaved.You can say what you want, or say what you see,Or you could say nothing - it's all the same to me.
