I see you walking home alone, your face is alive and brightBut you can't see how weak you are 'cause I could end it tonightIt's the feeling you get when you think that someone behind is watching youWell I can tell you now, that someone is me and I'm about to make it rightWhy do you take it all?Why do I beg for more?I never thought that this is how I'd hit the floorWhy do you take it all?Why do I beg for more?I never thought that this is how I'd HIT THE FLOOR!I creep up from behind, touch your neck, move down your spineYou take a look and breathe so sharpJust a matter of timeDon't scream I ask of you, but then you let one out and now it's time to goI come down on you like a ton of brickAll over so it's time to goWhy do you take it all?Why do I beg for more?I never thought that this is how I'd hit the floorWhy do you take it all?Why do I beg for more?I never thought that this is how I'd hit the floorHIT THE FLOOR!Whoa-oah!Whoa-oah!Whoa-oah!Whoa-oah!Why do you take it all?Why do I beg for more?I never thought that this is how I'd hit the floorWhy do you take it all?Why do I beg for more?I never thought that this is how I'd HIT THE FLOOR!Take this for me, I don't wanna hurt youTake this for me, I don't WANNA HURT YOU!
