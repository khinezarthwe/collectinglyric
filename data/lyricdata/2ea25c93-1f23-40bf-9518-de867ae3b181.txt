Flip over the sun, turn it into a moon,Bathe me in it's milk light, wrap me in cocoon.Leave me there all seasons, let me stay and change,Drinking in the sunshine, cry it out as rain.Sewing up the seams, step into character,Trip onto the stage, over my words.Waiting for the moment, waiting for your looks,Hoping that you love me, when I fly out in baby wings...I fly through summer let the seasons change,Drink in the sunlight; cry it out as rain.I fly through summer let the seasons change,How life is just a big game.You'll see what I become, I'll see what I became,How nothing can now be the same again.Take my hand I'll show you a lifetime of days, years.I'll leave your blood singing.I'm bathing in the milk light.Over and out, again.I fly through summer let the seasons change,Drink in the sunlight; cry it out as rain.I fly through summer let the seasons change,How life is just a big game.You'll see what I become, I'll see what I became,How nothing can now be the same again.Ooooh Summer.The seasons change.A lifetime of days, years, minutes and months gone.Another bump on the head. I couldn't remember...A lifetime of days, years, minutes and months, gone.
