Tried the frontside,but it's all locked so it's no go!The pain inside my neck is leavin' leavin'and then we sit on the grass and oh!Seems so obvious,Seems so obvious.Why don't you try these fields across my eye,I ran into a fountain trying to get dry.Saw a horse, he ran in too,The back of the room's where the children go to cry.So obvious, so obvious, so obvious,So obvious, so obvious, so obvious.
