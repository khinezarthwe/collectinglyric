Oooh Oooh Ooooh OooohOooh Oooh Ooooh OooohI’m the obsessorHolding your handIt seems you have forgottenAbout your manAlone in the darknessMy bed’s a different landYour touch intensifiesAnd I’m in the quicksandI’m in the quicksandI’m in the quicksandYou’re the upsetterStroking my handWhat’s my position?I don’t understandAm I your possession?Am I in demand?Oh when you turn to meI’m in the quicksandI’m in the quicksandI’m in the quicksandYou, you moved into my mind againYou, walking around and free OoohOh I could let you stayBut I’m walking on broken ground againOh, oh when will I learn?All you do is push me back in the dirtI'm in the quicksandI'm in the quicksandI'm in the quicksandI'm in the quicksandI'm in the quicksand
