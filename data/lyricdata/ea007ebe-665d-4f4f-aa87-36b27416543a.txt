On the shore of the lakeIn the great upstate of New YorkCame the call of a loonCold, cold, o'er a plume of smokeHe spoke to my centerHe spoke of the futureHe sang, "You, my friend, are alone, alone."We live with the cockroachAnd we split our cords of oakAnd keep this wood stove burningWhile the bitter winds are blowingWe stow our words in the cellarSo we never lose hopeAnd keep this wood fire stokedWhile the bitter winds blowAlone on the landIn the love of the dirt againThere's a sharp, jagged winterAt the center of my homeOf my blood and bonesThat sleets and snows and makes me shiverBut you, my heart, I will never knowWe live with the cockroachAnd we split our cords of oakAnd keep this wood stove burningWhile the bitter winds are blowingWe stow our words in the cellarSo we never lose hopeAnd keep this wood fire stokedWhile the bitter winds blow
